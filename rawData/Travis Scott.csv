[Intro: Drake]
Astro, yeah
Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & The Notorious B.I.G.]
(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose
[Bridge: Big Hawk & Swae Lee]
Some-Some-Some-Someone said
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (Someone said)
To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-Play-Playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Uncle Luke]
Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

[Bridge: Travis Scott, Swae Lee & Big Hawk]
Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Play-Playin' for keeps
Someone said, mother****, someone said
Don't play us for weak

Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five
Delta and I ship it overnight
Stop tryna be God Almighty
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes

Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, best not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love but want to really burn me

That's keepin' you so, so, so still, still?

That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

Only you can fix inside
So if I make it out tonight
Let's make it a badass time

Okay, I got it, copy
20/20 but I can't see nobody
One eye open, Illuminati
This might be the verse that make 'em drop me
Ain't makin' friends, we just makin' hobbies (Yeah)
No, that wasn't my girl, that was just a hobby (Yeah, yeah)
Call up 50, tell 'em load up the lobby
Elevator up, no need to find me, yeah, yeah

Newspaper stand, we press the issue (Press it, press it, press the issue)
We ain't sendin' shots, we launchin' missiles (Yeah, right up at your hood up north)
Checkin' Third Ward, I'm goin' mental
Fuckin' up my room, I've been rackin' up incidentals
Cookin' on a tune, I've been cheffin' up instrumentals
Nothin' else to do when you're ridin' in the
When you ridin' in the, in the back of the back seat (Back seat, back seat, back seat, back seat)

From a tribe of check-a-hoe like Indian

[Verse 2: André 3000]
To them I'm a big dick, a cheque and some laughter (Hahaha)
I guess it's all survival but please be careful, uh
I gave up on the Bible long time ago, uh
Oh, I hope it ain't give up on me, I don't know, ha
I came up in the town, they were murderin' kids, hmm
And dumped 'em in the creek up from where I live (Ayy)
Bodies, bodies, bodies sprinkled around (Uh, uh)
We runnin' through the sprinkler lookin' around
Killer would show up with boxes of pizza, uh
And said he had a label recruitin' people (Uh)
Put that on my grandma and everything, yeah
My homie said he told 'em his name was Wayne
It could've been me or could've been you too
But what a memory, it may need interludes (Could've been me)

So I could pop a wheelie and walk it too

To spend this honeymoon in a brothel?

But they'll be quick to turn that into a scandal
I'm down in the Meadows
Slidin' down the Waterfall, creep to the ghetto
Need my Rio de Janeiro
And I'm swimmin' out that bitch, Michael Phelps with the medals
So visit me (Yeah)

Don't have words with me 'cause I got a mind filled
I could tell Larry David was the mind behind Seinfeld
Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield
Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills
Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos
Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap
Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack
One year, it's Illuminati, next year, it's the Sunken Place
They don't want me to change, nah, nigga run in place
I need someone else to make this drink, because
You don't understand the juice to vodka ratio
That could satisfy a real drunk, guess what?
Never trust a bartender that don't drink, bitch

And the sky keep on callin', the drugs I keep callin'
They keep pickin' up for me, they love me

Your shit ain't gettin' me high no more

Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourselves consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of ""Fuck this shit""
At that moment, the one known as Jacques turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch leading the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it to wherever the fuck they gon' be in life
But wherever it is, it's better than here, so fuck you, and fuck this

[Chorus]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights—, lights—, lights—
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Verse 1]
You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both in this club, we both tryna fuck
I'ma rub a dub, tryna get a nut
[Chorus]
No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me and come down with me
Yeah, that's all I need in my fantasy

[Interlude: T.I.]
The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Will he survive, or will he fold up?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say ""Fuck you""
To the ones who said ""Fuck you""
'Til you doing ya thing, codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
""La Flame,"" he hears in his head, ""The world is yours"" (Yours, yours)

[Refrain]
Wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish
[Verse 2]
It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga goin' James Harden
They was wildin' on us niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold-hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'ma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'ma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking could you hold one?
Who do I owe? Nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'ma make this shit crack Lamar Odom
'Til I climb to the top of the podium

[Refrain]
So wake up, nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm, might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy 'cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis 'cause my mind too outlandish

Pray for who lost they fate and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off in this club
I pray that the demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man, I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been living
Man, I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab up J-Will, gotta scoop up J-Rich
Told Chase we ain't going back, you know we gotta hitch
I mean, I'm aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feeling kinda lit
Contemplating fornicating, might as well fuck up some shit
They looking at me way too crazy, got me feeling communist
But I'm just trying to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix (Just ask the lonely)
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz (Just ask the lonely)
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us

Get down, I'm prayin' (Get down, I'm prayin')
Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up getting all the knots, dodging cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks (Just ask the lonely)
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch (Just ask the lonely)
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinking 'bout this new girl, and she doing pop (Oh-oh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Oh-oh)
And fuck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Say it loud)
Mama, don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more (Just ask the lonely)
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow (Just ask the lonely)
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love

No, oh, oh (Woah)
We don't pray for love, no more, no more (Woah, woah, woah)
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton (You don't wanna see no more)
We don't wanna see you on the news (No more, no more, no more, no more), all alone

[Verse 3: The Weeknd]
Underrated is an understatement
They tryna test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watching all of my moves
'Cause the music like crack, got me cooking all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she wanna be wifey
She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life
So I pull out for the climax, faster than a hi-hat
Sorry, baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke, boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot, though he'd rather not
Forever been the elephant in the room
That everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group
That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
Will he make it? Was it worth it?

Baby, I just left from Vegas
Did 'em dirty on the table
Went and bought a new Bentayga
I paid cash, don't see no paper
Buy it, park it, tint it later
All my cars' inside tomato
From Atlanta, not Decatur
I'm the one they say don't play with
Make them boys get on your tater
High-five LeBron, floor seat the Lakers
Get more paper, get more haters
Standin' still, my diamonds skatin'
Fucked her once, she think we datin'
I can spend it, I been savin'
I'ma spin ya, try to play me
I been trappin' up the millions, used to trap it off a RAZR
Back when I was sellin' two-for-five plays, called in my RAZR
Niggas never had to give it to me, I want it, I'ma take it
Guaranteed to tell a ho goodbye if she don't try to get naked
I'm like mmh

Got some more bad vibes comin' through

Still impatient, still sippin' on liquor
Still rollin' up Swishers

On your girl rubbin' on my favorite features

Custom the things, custom the wings
I had to custom the vibe, custom the link up
Cover the back of the lab, front cover magazine
Cover your eyes, cuddled up, back of the V (Yeah)
Our chemistry, just like the trappers and fiends (Ooh)
Our misery really ain't nothin' to see
I gotta travel the V, I like to travel to heat (Ooh)
Bring out a bag of the weed
Did I tell you I got my own weed? I had a lot to achieve
Blew it out and I'm relieved, take it down, now you relieve
Rather you leave, then you go back out on me
Don't throw no daggers at me, you gotta shoot 'em at least
You know my Dodge supreme, I put in hours this week
Movin' at rapid speed, like it's a track, we meet
We got a timeless thing, we gotta find some Zs, yeah

Fuck shit up at the club, shit tucked
We be floatin' front to back, back to back, Bentley truck
Back up, Bentley truck, city stuck, stuck, stuck
City up, up, back to back, fold up, fold up, fold up, trust

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Like it thick with a bounce, we all in the count
Wine bottles cost 'bout a couch, you on the way with the wave
Stacks in my pouch, you know it jump at the house
You come with two when it's late, know the brown one is my fav'
Then Mike Brown gon' walk you out (Walk you out)
Step by step, watch yourself
Cleaners got anything you might've left
I couldn't do none of this by myself
With mafia, they in the tuck
I gave you fifty to boost up your butt
I gave you the juice, you'd rather get buzzed
I tried to choose you, you'd rather go club
Know what to do, you rattled me up
Common denominator, we were steps from the diamond ages
Got a couple of vibrations
For the simulation, gotta re-up the hydration

I can tell by the night tales and the dry spells
All the wrong ones and the right things to stay away from
And how we took off and how we on top
And how we won't fall, how we going up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic but we called that shit the basement
Bass used to break all my momma vases
Unc shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn't eight then
Always had the gas like I broke wind
They said my way of making dollars never made sense
Come take a dive, a waterfall in the deep end
I can tell you 'bout the nights out in Fort Bend

And all my ideas before the cornrows (Straight up)

Going donuts, coffee couldn't help now (La Flame)
How we zoned out, made it out the wood now
And what it do when they wanna be your friend now (Oh, no)
How to get it, how to live and get it in now
How to go from scraping pockets, making his demand now
I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble 'bout it (Yeah)
Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle (Yeah)
Five-o-four hot boys
Minus the bad rap like Silkk the Shocker (Yeah)
But I'ma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk

Fans never missin' out a word on the verses
Never sit around, just workin', it was worth it
That's for certain, I deserve it
Lord knows we don't get tired, been through more dirt than a derby
Mama worked for AT&T, and we still ain't get that service
She stayed in/out the hospital, you know that made me nervous
Still step out the house to smell so fresh, fresh like detergent
If a bitch don't want me, don't need them still got my Jergens
And bitch, you can keep them herpes, go alert me
No house light on, cop light on, fuck this journey
You heard me, you heard me, now, swervin', hittin' curbs
And my nigga, my nigga came home so it just got real

I've been taking risks to make that money flip, shots to the head
I ain't order it, I can't afford this shit
Go to war with this you overboard, I'm over bored with shit
Now, it's pay up player, pay a nigga
Gotta day to day to stack and still I pay accountants
Twenty racks to show just a little allowance
Only come to Houston if the boy allow it
Bow your head to a real one, coming down with them main niggas
H-Town, don't play with us, them wit-it boys stay wit-wit-wit it
I've been grinding, slaving over time since I was a fan
Looking in the mirror like ""One day, Jacques, you gon' be the man""
One skinny, tatted nigga, blunt flicker
Young La Flame, hot spitter who can't hold his liquor, yah

Three shots and you faded
Freaks coming out at night and they gettin' X rated
Four shots now she wanna do the clique
Any more shots she ain't gon' remember shit
Smoking on extendos, no clips
Project hoes going up in the Ritz (Trippy)
She gon' do it for a G, anything for me, bruh
She just wanna fuck and drink and chief all the weed up
Sexy bitch, pop that pussy 'cause you in your prime
Pour that purple over ice, call it ""turtle time""
Shawty never been a hesitator
Got her going down on the elevator
Heard the pussy bomb, I'ma detonate her
Fuck her from the back, keep the neck for later
No magic trick, but I levitate her
With the magic stick, nothing less than great
When I hit her with the dope D, I'm gone
Don't text me later, no extra favors

Hmm, weed, lean, MDMA, he say, she say
All the products of a young man gone the long way
From the home that he knew, 'til he roamed where he at
And the phone break up, unknown wake up
Several one night stands, hung up phone, break up
If he fall, will he fly? Sure, wouldn't take much
For you to find out, jump, if you took that plunge
If not, we're in the same spot, how could you judge?

And Pops never gave me shit
But Pops ain't raised no bitch
I swung, I missed, he swung, he hit, then I hit that ditch
Raised in a town where it looked so good outside
Like it ain't that serious

Locked up in the car, had to pull a gun quick

I take a shot of Pimp C and slow up
I do this shit for him and me
I'm the next lone star to blow-up
Picture being locked in a box
Selling beats 'cause you need dollars
They say I can make it to the league, mama
500 dollars all we need, mama
Then we gon' be on
Tired of seeing the lights off
Pops heatin' up the stove
Was close to stealing and killing, now just to get 'em on
Couple drinks down of Rosé
I'm tipsy, y'all faces done look like an emoji
The RAV4 turned into a Rover
'Til it took flight and ended up on the shoulder
Now our money a little longer
Lookin' back how we finnesin', we ain't know shit
They gave me three, got twenty five on the low
Who knew that lump sum would get me on?
My fifteen seconds last a little longer, longer
I can shit all day, diaper
Call that eat-all-day; itis
Will I ever fall off? I doubt it

No, no, no, no
All these diamonds shinin'
All this gold on me, all these foes on us
How do I dodge these zombies?
They want my soul from me
Know that I'm gone, but one thing:
They will never catch me
Falling off, falling off
Never catch me falling off

Without a couple texts that I can't deny
Locked the phone, I had to close my eyes
Half the time, man, they tellin' lies
Who to trust? Man, I can't decide
Nowadays, we just don't reply

Damn these rare thoughts is so endless, bougie bitch whippin' the 'Rari
Out in the jungles, make it rumble, she get wet like safari
Bitches don't know, I teach 'em the ropes, Scottie the Pope
Now only Giuseppe, Celine, Bottega
Proenza, the Schouler is all that she know
Might let the drop top, and she's Lamb' fam
Whippin' trans am, keep it low
She pulled out the hard white on the highway
For the line, listen, pimpin'
Your bitch just might physic my disick, disick all business
Might blizzard, roll up, crib look like the tele
Left jelly all over her biscuit
Last spring I lost 10K in teeth
I copped it but now I don't miss it
Whoever found it, teeth probably glistenin'

Where the weather is warm

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Moonlight move when a nigga dance
Peep a nigga steeze from a nigga stance
Had to leave home wasn't working out
Kiss moms for me if you get a chance
Walk the streets where I stay
Niggas give me daps and pounds they can't wait
In the moonlight, you can't see my eyes
And when I'm off the things I can't think
Man I been coasting the coast
Swear a young nigga done been through the most
Washing my mind out with dope
Shit real, but you know a nigga can't choke
When they recognize a real nigga still
Ride with me, down with me, say he a float
And all my real niggas sitting in the VIP
Shoving champagne through the next girl throat

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Lost in the moonlight, run through the moonlight, who knew?
Cop lights, no lights, 'cause the bills they was overdue
Now a skinny iggy nigga got fits from the runway
Taking trips to the side of the moon
Had to take trips to define my peace
But I got a little feeling it might be in that tomb
I like my weed a little cheese, roll that that a little thick
Better watch your toke, you don't wanna choke
Better let that jack roll down your neck
I'm on some popular shit, come look in my eyes and get a fix
We just gon' cruise hit the brews, lay back don't worry 'bout shit
It might get rowdy 'cause all the freaky models wanna party
All the freaky models in the lobby, it's so obvious that they lobbyist
Man it can't be realer, me and my niggas in the villa
She in that white dress it can't fit her
Sweet not bitter, drink like you got no liver
Hit it and she on the moon my nigga

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Touch the sky, and go dance on the moon
Where the weather is warm and we forever live long
[Verse 3: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall, two cups, hold up, hold up
I'm headed to the moon 'cause the world screwed up
Like the city, I grew up so
I'm pouring up a co-cup, 'bout to get tore up
Got a Xanax crushed up
If you spill my cup, it'll get you fucked up
Pull up to the moon with the trunk up
Gettin' sucked up with three blunts rolled up
Smoke all three at the same time: call that triple OG
In the triple D, I'm full when I'm on E, you don't know nothing 'bout me
Backwood feel with a Compton tree
Getting full of that oil, I got gas and grease
Three lines poured up in the big East
Baptized a blunt but I ain't no priest
Peach Ciroc with a Norco, piece of hash and my trippy sticks
OG wax on a bone with a skillet, me and Paskel been doing that shit
Def' rocking link, what you know about this
Baby Bash came through with the kush assist
Percocet ten and a soma twist on the moon
Getting higher than a bitch and I'm doing my dance

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Let's get high, and go dance on the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We could fly, and go straight to the moon
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I don't know about you
Feel like I'm floating through the night
Slow move to the groove
Often the feeling feels right
In the night, in the night, in the night, the night
Feel like I'm floating through traffic
(Then it ""poof"" like magic)17Embed"

Baby do not go fast, go slow, wait (skrt skrt)
Tell me, tell me information, I got rank (tell me)

Never ever, do I wanna leave my little lady
Patrón down, back down, they got a plan 'fore that boy wake
Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise)

[DJ Screw]
10-201, you know what I'm sayin'?
Smokin' big, drankin' syrup, know what I'm talkin' 'bout?

(Cassette rewinding)

[Sample from Lil Flip's ""I Can Do Dat""]
What, sucker free, what, what
I can do dat (I can do dat right there)
I can do dat, ay

If I spill drank on my clothes - I can do dat
It don't matter cause I buy me some more - I can do dat
I'ma spend about fifty in the mall - I can do dat
I'ma buy me a Bentley in the fall - I can do dat
I'ma stop weak niggas from rappin'...

[Sample from Z-Ro's ""I Can't Leave Drank Alone""]
I, can't, leave, drank alone

Feel like I'm on the drive to the moon
Man I thought the world was ending soon
Damn, the devil stay testin' and the devil wear Prada
(Just tryna go up the avenue)

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Whether I'm shinin' all winter or chillin' all summer
We rockin' furs, look like I copped 'em straight out the jungle
Used to spend cheese up on the steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep that my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that's the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours, I just stared at the stars
And looked with my eyes closed 'cause it's driving me wild

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away
[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive
Hit the weed and just drive, oh, yeah

[Chorus: James Fauntleroy]
Sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your eyes
With my hands behind your head
While you take me away

[Outro: Travis Scott's Dad & Travis Scott]
Junior!
Fuck!

Too late to make me change

'Cause I know, soon, I'll be comin' down
I'll be comin' down, I'll be comin' down
Darker, darker in the back of the night

I been got it, got it, got it, feelin' so right
Windin', windin', why'd you wind it so tight?
I been runnin' from my face, so precise
I didn't get it, got me happed in my ride
I just run up on and smashin' the side
They're the counts, I been all in my city
