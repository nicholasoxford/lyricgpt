Hey, oh, oh, down with the shit

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Smoke this, drink this, straight to my liver
Watch this, no tick, yeah I'm the nigga
Gang rap, X-mas, smoke, shots I deliver
Faded, Vegas, might sponsor the killer
Shake it, break it, hot-hot for the winter
Drop it, cop it, eyes locked on your inner object
Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'
Give me, give me, give me some
Freak the freckles off your face
Frenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue
Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Fuckin' in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full, probly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro
You shoppin' from the window, play my favorite tempo

Sword in my hand, I fight like this
And I'm more than a man, I'm a god
Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say ""Doo-doo-doo-doo,"" bitch, that be K. Dot
She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!

Psych ward is ballin', go craze like no other
Weed steady blowin', pass the blunt to my momma
Runs in the family, puff-puff keep a nigga fiendin'
Faded, faded, faded, right?
Shot glass super size, she gon' get some dick tonight
Meet me at the W, and no, it's not the Westside
Stick it up your SoutHside (Icky-icky, icky-icky)
Baller futuristic, groovy gangsta with an attitude
What these niggas make a year

You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck

You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up

What is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga

[Verse 1]
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say
[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Verse 2]
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like ""It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight""
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
""Fuck police"" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh, a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs, we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son
[Chorus]
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & ScHoolboy Q]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates, break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress, you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah

It's impossible to love it, if you don't come from it
It's things that goes on, you just can't stomach
I seen it all happen, but I ain't sayin' nada
Peep, 24/7 in the hood it's hot

He don't pick up then it ain't bool
Let you know it ain't good to stop
That part, that part (That part)
I'm a Watts nigga and we not kosher
Shit, niggas only concern is the bottom line like a stockholder
This is where they come, where they cop them boulders
Hoes catfight with their tits exposed
Still sippin' on that Wild Irish Rose
Still rock swap-meet designer clothes, ah!
Black MAC 11 in my mattress (Woo!)
Make a hundred racks do a backflip (Woo!)
Might go Uncle Luke on them hoes (Ho!)
Pussy pop for a bankroll (Yeah)
All my killers with me got a blank face (Yeah)
On that ""Fuck you, bitch, where the pay pay?""
Make 'em pull up on your block with them 223s
Aim it at your face, hey
Movin' with the rock and the Glock concealers

You either on the watch or the clock is tickin'

Protect me from the local threats

Society kept my IQ vexed
Denyin' me from an Ivy school
Applyin' me to the street I slept
I quietly had to hold this tool
Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search of laws and verse of the birth I nest

Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
""Get Mine"" my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines, drive-bys at bedtime
Get down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

[Chorus]
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind
Niggas talkin' 'bout, soundin' like

[Verse 2]
My time to show out, finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth, my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rat
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap, this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school, this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay

Tell Kendrick, move from the throne, I came for it

On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy

[Verse 3]
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doin', long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her temple, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign, go rare with my mignon

[Intro: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mil' and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me but they should've shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg' on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coat
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy, want a piggyback
Rock cremation, then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
'Til Tito kilos come off that boat
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q]
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
Treat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice
Graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bankroll (stand on your bankroll)
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po-lice
When I was poor with no lights
When I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches
Oh Lord, she in Christians
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
God'll judge, no conviction
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word 'round town, I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say ""Que pasa with the pesos?""
Promethazine codeine, caseloads (T.R.U.)
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!

100k in my trunk
Keep that bitch with that donk
She gon' pop in them heels

She gon' roll on them pills
Just don't grab on my hat
This that shit that's Iraq
This that make you climax
This that shit you just bought
This that Q go hamhawk
This that car that won't park
Pedal to floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop
Oxymoron in stores
Come in, kids, lock the door
Knock-knock-knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top
Could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill
Get them slugs off for real
This that curl with the gel
We gon' win, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell
Leave that punani killed
All them hoes run to Q
Spit that truth, make the loot

Spent 2 bills on my socks

Ain't got no jewelry on—still, I'm shining hard (Hard)
Ain't got no bodyguard, walking solo through the mall (Mall)
Bitches and the hoes know—they see me, they like, ""There he go!"" (Oh)
They be like, ""There he go! Schoolboy, there he go!"" (Go)
Chiefing like a motherfuckin' Seminole
Here we go, off probation, probably go to Mexico
Furthermore, can't find this in the store, this shit ain't for the low
Got my daughter swaggin' like her motherfuckin' daddy, though (Daddy, though)
The patio—what a motherfuckin' view (View, ooh)
Nappy chin hairs, bitch, I'm motherfuckin' Q (Q, Q, Q, ugh)
Motherfucker, motherfucker
Yeah, ""fucking"" is my favorite word—reason why I'm fucking her
She swallow my dick and balls, whatever occur
Purr! (Purr-r-r) I love that kitty-cat
Ass fat, throw it back—I can't believe you wifing that
Deepthroat, seven or eleven, she's a double-gulp (Mm)
My pistol drawn, her boyfriend got me paranoid (Paranoid)
Nigga try sneaking up on me, and I'm making noise, ugh (Bla-kah, bla-kah, bla-kah)
But what I failed to understand: I'm the motherfuckin' man (Hey, hey)
Ran into him (Hey), he's a fan, goddamn

My agenda for today is to make bread or get laid

So I'm standing by that stop sign with nickels and them dimes
Keep that work, got that Oxy, need that kilo, call that papi
Know my steelo, shrimp with sake, sold that her-on, look like toffee
Keep my nina, just might off him, no them boys on Figg don't play
Most my life on 51st, went to school on 52nd
Used to fight on 49th, Grandma said be home by night
But her old ass sixty-something, so three hours late aight
Still I love her, R.I.P., when she died, I took her place
And became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street

Charge them smokers day through night; selling pies, who need a slice?
Life is craps so shoot the dice, get the cheese but cut the mice
Enemies be left to right, we don't call our shit the trap
Bitch we call our shit the set, unless we OD with Reynold's Wrap
After crack it's Oxy next, but thank God the yay was yay
Off the yee like it's the bay, rock a chain, I'm Kunta K

Real Crippy since I hopped off the swing
With my strap, that's my peace offering (Yo, yeah, uh, yeah)
Five shots get rung out, five bodies falling
Come put your lights out, I spark your apartment
Deadline my clothing, don't fuck with Pink Dolphin
Strap on his hairline, his forehead gets softened
Send extras through his chest bones, shit, he don't need that coffin
Most niggas would've run away, but me I'm out here walking
Bucket hat with my shades on, my wardrobe look awesome
Now, nah, I ain't on no dolphin, fuck rhyming, I'm Cripping
Niggas rap about what I'm living
All this false claiming, I'm marring
Doing drive-bys I ain't steering
White funerals, I ain't tearin'
Fuck your bitch in front of your children
Steal your whip side of my building, yeah

Aim out the eyeball, I'm getting violent, I got the strike once
Won't get the strike twice, you niggas half-price

Get roped and choked and rope-a-doped
Extra overdose of the oki-doke
Get a nigga smoked, I ain't no joke
Tired of this bullshit and everything y'all talk about
They walked 'em in, I walked 'em out
They talked 'em in, I chalked 'em out
Now cock back that Oxy (Pow-pow, pow-pow)
Walk inside, pistols popping, top is popping off
Papadopoulos neighborhood, rolling 60 balls
Ghetto tribalist, squeezing pussies like octopuses
Nigga, show me where the money at, show me where the kush is
Next time you see me I'll probably be in the bushes

[Verse 1]
Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets, Adderall
Xanny bars, get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now depression creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box
Prescription drugs
[Interlude: Joy]
Daddy, daddy
What's wrong, daddy?!
Wake up!
Wake up!
[Verse 2]
Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time
He said ""Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes""
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some 'Woods for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Why it's night? But that's my life
Prescription drugs

What's wrong?
You tired?
You mad?
Okay, I love you, daddy

What you know about a pill, plus a 8-ball
You gotta re-up 50 times just to get a rack off, ungh
I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's
Only took two days, only re-up'd one time
Where the sun barely shine and it rain for about
Nine months out the year, man it's something right here
For Seattle nigga, cheers
When I look up at y'all city like lookin' in the mirror
Damn near had a career, just might shed a tear, ungh
Man, this shit right here for my niggas who ain't make it home
Sitting on a tear, got a dap to a nigga bright in here
Feeling life ain't fair
If I was in your shoes, I would've copped, don't care
Had a scene, had the medics like clear, ungh
Big body cold like a Polar Bear, ungh
I done sold more shit than hookers
Expensive tees, resemble a push up
Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas
Uh—vanity slave, got whips and chains

Groovy, when I die tell Spike Lee make a movie
Ooh wee, cops bringing dogs
Hope they don’t sniff my bitch booty
Oxy, O-X-Y, only feel like I could stop me
Quincy, now how you nigga sliding up
Every now and then in a Bentley?
Easy, 60-40-50
You can get one for 30 if you let me hold your titty
Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty
Just stopped selling crack today
When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it glide like Dr. J
I prescribe you, I'm your doctor, kay?
You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit
You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit
Do you like this shit, nigga?
Your brain go numb, synthetic heroin
Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit, so I don't listen
In fact ""We living to die"" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one

Ugh (Ugh), we might die for this shit, nigga
Ugh (Ugh, ugh), might go down for this shit, nigga

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
Ga-gangbanging, that Crip shit
Nigga said ""Cuz"" in the first grade
In the shade where the cops can't see us (Can't see us)
Eighteen, tryna dodge the cage
It was cool 'til that gang sweep (Sweep)
Now I'm in back of a van and my wrists got a band (Got a band)
Got a number for a name (For a name)
No name on the visit, no call get accepted
Now I'm forced to a man (To a man)
Murder raps, where you from?
Put the nigga on his pockets
Watch the COs, they be watching (Watching)
Counting noodles for the hustle (Yeah)
County spread for the muscle
Couple marks on my knuckles (Yeah, yeah)
Puttin' niggas on bunk status (Yeah)
Shoulda been with the bitch-ass
Now he on a mattress that we bench-press
PC, get the Froot Loops (Ooh)
Keep tellin' on niggas
Why I fuck with that nigga? (Nah, ayy, nah, ayy, yeah)
Nigga made bail but I'm still at rage
Should I thank God for the hell I raised?
'Cause the nigga that snitch is gonna feel that grave, like
Ain't nothin' to a Loc, huh? (Huh)
Went missin' to his folks, I ain't in, I ain't know, huh? (Huh)
They ain't show up to the court, huh? (Huh)
But then charges gotta go, huh? (Huh)
A young nigga back on Figg (Ugh)
H-Crown on wig, shoestrings say where I'm from
On probation and got my gun
Other side goin' for that thumb (Blop-blop)
Motherfucker, I'm gangbanging (Ooh, ugh, Gotti)
[Verse 2: Traffic]
Nigga I'm blue'd up (Crip), blue Chucks
Blue tee, nigga, I keep it G (I keep it G)
Nigga, in the streets is where I be
I'm up like breakfast while niggas sleep (I got that...)
Me and Floyd posted on Figg (Posted)
Getting it in and moving it out
Getting it in and moving it out
I'm holding the heat, he watching the block
I'm watching for cops, I'm holding these rocks (Holding)
Fiends keep coming, this shit don't stop (Don't stop)
When it's war time, niggas get popped (Pop)
We might die for this shit, off tops
My nigga gon' ride for this Crip, no lie (Nigga)
But I ain't dead yet, nigga, thank God (Thank God)
Money got niggas lookin' at me all odd (What you...)
Broke-ass niggas better go get a job
Run up on me wrong, bitch nigga, get popped (Get popped)
I'm gon' ride for this shit, on Crip
A nigga gon' die for this shit if they trip
Four-fif extendo, with fifty in the clip
TF by my side, he stupid with this shit (That's my Loc)

Run up on me wrong (Nigga, err)
My nigga, my nigga, I'm gangbanging
[Verse 3: TF]
Ugh, might go down for this check, nigga
Ugh, I might die for this set, nigga (Ayy)
I ain't trippin nigga, I ain't slipping
Nigga lying saying I ain't Cripping
Back to back, me and Tiny smack
I said back to back, straight cups of 'gnac
Niggas ask, ""What he signed for?""
I got an eight ball, I got a Rondo
I got an AK, when that bitch spray
It's like pullin' strings on a lawnmower
Last time I seen jail, nigga
I was cell living, getting mail in it
I ain't even talking mail, nigga
PayPals for the cell, nigga (Ha)
Hit the streets and cause hell, huh?
School of hard knocks, fuck Yale, huh?
See me and Traffic like a orca, nigga
And the black-and-whites, love whale watch (Ugh)
Front-line like mailboxes (What?)
Five twelve, that's the numbers on it (What?)
May first, May deuce, May twelfth, members only (Agh)
.45, no numbers on it (Ugh)
Scratched down, I'm strapped down (Brr)
Might go down for this shit (What?)
If I don't then I'm racked down (Racks)
Rank up there with Shaq crown
I got a Benji button like Brad Pitt (Brad Pitt)
I press that, I'm getting rich
I might go down for this shit (This shit)

[Verse]
I got that work, fuck Labor Day, just bought a gun
Fuck punching in
Throwing rocks, no hopscotch
Bet my 9 milli' hit the right spot
Bang!... Last night it was a dream
This morning a fantasy back when the only fan I had was a fiend
(Huhhuhhuh-huhhuh!)
Meet me by the Acura, cause the cops like
To get help from the store camera, they always in my cornea
But it's cool, I've been catching on to they formula
See I'm a real loc, my street sign I'll kill fo'
Then rewind my Indo, then unroll my rillo
The bad guy, never once been a ho's hero
He get zero, I said nada, bitch pass the 'cama (Uh, yeah)

[Chorus]
How'd it feel to be a real nigga? (I'm a product of a real nigga)
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)
Fuck with one of my real niggas
(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
(Sunlight, night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga (My whole life I've been a real nigga)
La-la familia (Get confronted by a real nigga)
Fuck with one of my real niggas
(It's on like night fall, summertime gotta ball)
How'd it feel to be a real nigga?
[Part 2]

[Chorus]
I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him
But... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)

[Verse 1]
Find a nigga realer than me, my socks stink (yeah)
Eat so much pussy that my mustache pink
Strapping, my pants seam, no need for a belt, gangsta lean help
Hoodie on backwards, with the eyes cut out
My hate felt my .45 elder, poetry's deep
I never fail ya, ScHoolboy bust flame
Orange-yellow higher than Margielas, since a young nigga
I admired the crack sellers, seen my uncle steal
From his mother, now that's the money that I'm talking 'bout
Think about it, the smoker ain't got shit and everyday
He still get a hit, whether jacking radios or sucking dick
Sell his kids and chop his wrists and sealing his lips
Cause he don't want the feds arresting his fix, didn't take much
To get me convinced, coincidence that I ain't fucking with work
Unless we rewind, and answer my church
Times getting harder, than my dick on a growth spurt
Around the same time, all you niggas was on purp, my sober ass Was snatching her purse, make the ice cream truck
Freeze! Give me the keys, extra Fritos, chili and
Cheese! Threw some Baby Lucas in his eyes, before I
Leave! The cops'll never get the lead, grandma taught me well
And my uncle gun, was the accessory, 211 sipping, plus a robbery
[Refrain]
This little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome

[Chorus]
I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him
But... Every last one of us had a pistol in the room, nigga
But... Click-clack, pow-pow-pow (Boom, nigga)
But... Me Glock clock familia (Boom)

[Verse 2]
Grandma said she loved me, I told her I loved her more
She always got me things, that we couldn't afford
The new Js and Tommy Hill in my drawers
Sega Genesis, Nintendo 64, see Golden Eye was away at war
We wasn't thinking of getting money then
Nor did I wonder why, my uncle done sold his Benz
Cause he been tripping now, he sweats a lot and slimming down
I also notice moms be locking doors, when he around
But anyways, his wife done left him and now he living with us
My bike is missing, Grandma like to hide her check every month
My uncle's nuts, he used to give me whiskey to piss in cups
Knocking on the door telling me to ""Hurry up!"", he in a rush
I gave it to him, then got my ass whipped for doing it
Moms used to tell me like, ""Nigga, know who you dealing with.""
Them was the good days ,'til I was raised the older ways
Rat-Tone, my nigga's brother showed me my first K
I was amazed, me and Floyd was in the back
He called us over like - HEY!
YAWK, YAWK, YAWK, YAWK! We like -""Daaaaaamn, nigga""
Then again - YAWK, YAWK! We like, ""Daaaaaamn, nigga!""
Hearing him say ""Cuz'"", turned us to a faaaaaan, nigga!
Later on he got locked, so now we're taking his fades
Continue the chapter from his life, we flipping that page
Gangbanging was a ritual and Grandma would help
She should've never left her gun on the shelf
[Refrain]
This little piggy went to market, this little piggy carry chrome

[Chorus]
I done jumped up off my ass
Hit the lick and barely passed but I quickly got to balling
2012 ain't really happen
So I guess it's back to trapping, eyes open night to morning
Had roaches in my cereal
My uncle stole my stereo, my grandma can't control him

Gloomy on sunny days, shadows, no house or trees (Trees)
Prayers not close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see (The eye could see), hoodies and weaponry ('Ry)
Naive to being free (Free), locked us, we chasing keys (Ayy)
How your eyes investigate us ('Gate us)
While we look up to entertainers, ballplayers, pistol-bangers (Bangers)
Big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger (Ugh), and burn, fucker, burn (Burn)
Every step to getting deeper, survival my main concern ('Cern)
Marinating in Satan's sweat (Sweat), take a sip of this holy water (Water)
Hoping God still keep me blessed (Blessed), with a dark shield for my armor (Armor)

I'm a groovy type nigga, rather two-step with you

Chilling cool-cool with you

Groovy nigga, jumped up off of the peg
4th by my 3rd leg, plead the 5th
No Ls, no whips, backyard full of Crips
Barbecues and county blues, this Hoover gangster be the shit
It ain't much up on our list, shoot the killer and hit the licks
Get EBT up out the bitch, gangbanging, fuck a clique
Yup, I'm looking for a scrap
See, my Cripping done spread around the world
Put his top below his bottom, it's the reaper

Looking like the reaper in your driveway
Strays through your living room
Liable to drive-by on a summer day

Shells through a nigga, pariiing, Peedi Crack, riiing
Stop a dream in its tracks beam down
Little boy now, dream little boy, dream
Coke go in the pot, arm and hammer body
A$AP Rocky, want it I could get it
Onion in my pocket like the booty on a midget
Diamond on my rollie, teach a nigga how to fridge it
Looking at the times, they been winning for a minute
See my neck, co-defendant, what's the problem?
Seen the souls long gone before I got them
He was dead before I shot him, it's the reaper

Lit 'em up, light 'em up like a street light, nigga
Follow me, I can show you what these streets like, nigga
Handle bars of a Schwinn, guns blow like dusty winds
Spend a band, push his wig back when that revolver spins
Toe tag 'em, false flagging like it's all good
Tell niggas tee off like Tiger Woods, where you from?
We never heard of ya, walking with the murderers
Niggas that'll murder ya, steal you like a burglar
Seemed the soul was long gone before I got them
He was dead before I shot him, it's the reaper

Punk-ass cops, them crackers want us with our Black off
Thug life, nigga, since '96, I wanted to gangbang
Few years later, I'm really from it, we was still kids
Crack off, nigga, I'm squeezing empties 'til the shell break
Fuck my image, I need to drop, I need the blank face

Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keep a tool waist
Sell narcotics, I'm slangin' diamonds with you back then
Stack large commas, you with your riders, where your backbone?
You can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' 'til all the weed blown
Way long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right, uh

Yo, blank face, clear everything out the safe, crack the pig bank
Robbin' your kids too, my heart an igloo
The devil in all blue, huh (Yeah)
Die now, go to Heaven or bring 'em through
Lot of brown 'round here, got that white girl for you (Girl for you)
Uh, and she swimming in firewater
Could be double digits piercing through your Civic
Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, ayy, hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around, now you're hellbound, boogie down
Bullshit, I won't allow, slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat, contradictin' every piece
Leave him triple-six laying in defeat
Can you dig it? Struck a match that won't finish
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped
Squeezin' fingertips, ayy (Ayy)

Shoot the whole club up, fuck tryna sneak the K in
On the road to riches
Thank you, Mr. Reagan, you helped them dollars rake in
And to my uncle that fucked up the family
That shit that you was smokin', I was pushin'

Greet me by my hand 'til you teach me to float

If I don't come back, had a hell of a run
Taste you through my nose, smell the death on the tongue
Can't get high enough to get over the hump, huh
How many friends around me helping me lose?
How many excuses until I'm excused?
Shadow my morning, I ain't dreaming it right
Ain't no way a flower could bloom in the night

'Til I figure flying, I better escape
But flying ain't flying when you're stuck on your ass
Pleasure took my driver and caused me to crash, uh
Took me forever, we was stuck in the mud
Chicken crossed the road to get out of the hood
Was drawing this darker feeling, feeling my face

Place nothing above my love

No ifs, ands, or buts
You're sufficient, but I still wanna fill you up
When loves runs high (Ha!)
Just when you thought enough was enough
I'm a kid in a museum and I just wanna touch
Every part of your body, tie you up and get naughty
Ho, we up in this party, HiiiPoWeR, money showers

Pull up, pull up, bring it back, come, rewind (Hey!)
I wanna touch up and down your spine (Hey!)

Hmm, a perfect 10 living on Cloud 9

But it's hard to change when your from the set
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death
Life of crack I’d like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them runway jets
Fly to Singapore, one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you dont do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please don't let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love, put that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HGC, no A/C
Got the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the bees
[Bridge]
Birds or the beez
Birds or the beez

[Hook]
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

Get to busting, know you bluffing, nigga
If that bitch can't make me rich
Then ain't no need in fucking with her
Turn around and fuck her sister, heard that bitch got EBT

Try to creep on me, you're dying in your homie seat

In a stolen Expedition, in your hood, 'cause you the mission
Been a mathematician, loadin' nine, subtracting eight

Thug life nigga since '96 I wanted to gang bang
Few years later I'm really from it, we were still kids
Crack off nigga, I'm squeezing empty 'til the shell break
Fuck my image I need to drop, I need to, Blank Face
Cause brain damage from my mechanics, keeping two ways
Sell narcotics, I'm slanging diamonds with your pack then
Stack large commas, you with your riders with your backbone
Can't fold figures, I make deposits with the gold grin
Jeans look dirty, I lift the Chevy with the rims on
All bad bitches, they wanna fuck me with the cap gone
Real life nigga, I'm in the stu' 'til all the weed blown
Wait long, long, I hid the dope behind the cellphone
Y'all don't hear me, I want the money right, ugh

Crack the pig bank, robbin' your kids too
My heart an igloo, the devil in all blue, huh
Die now go to heaven or bring 'em through

And she swimming in fire water, could be double digits
Pistol through your Civic
Most die before they hear it, turn a nigga to a spirit
Drive slow, oh, hey
Hit the curb with shattered mirrors
Look around now you're hellbound, boogie down
Bullshit I won't allow, slang a bird every hou'
Smack a nigga with the heat

Leave you triple six laying in defeat

Struck a match, they won't finish
Drop a nigga off, get a nigga whipped
Squeezing fingertips, aye

Walk through the valley of the shadow of death, no rules, right

Washing my sins off in hell's water
Feel like the Bible told me lies as I pray to 'em
Kneel down, put my faith in 'em, will you answer me?

But if God won't help me, this gun will
I swear I'm gon' find my way

Uh, four corners
Cat and mouse chase, got cheese to catch
High on on some drug, I'm Space Cadet
Dreaming I don't live up on the block no more
Trapping, trying to make it out this obstacle
Life on the edge, hell a block away
Pretty Snow White turned eight today
Selling that base, no Dr. Dre
Uh, guess who in the building?
Bucket hat with a strap like a pilgrim
Uh, kneeling down with some questions to address like
Why the ones who commit the worst sins live the best?
The Ten Commandments, I can mark five checks
But I sense flaws, the Bible preaching blind threats
Streets held me down, got faith in a Pyrex
Faith in a four-five, I call it the clarinet
Sewer full of drugs when the toilet digests
From the cop raid, all can relate from the streets
To the wall from niggas to compadres
When the sun go down, I'm predicting a heatwave
Forecast your whole body, heat on, room full of homi's
I just pray that the Lord got me

Aim that, shoot that, pledge allegiance
Kill mine, kill yours, make it even
Soul need saving, Mr. Preacher
I know I only come around when it's Easter
Funerals, Thanksgiving, Christmas time
When I'm in jail or when my card declined
Uh, will you answer me?
Take me out of hell and make plans for me?
Misery loves company, ain't a surprise
It was just me and my niggas, we was trying to survive
But we would never make it out alive
Shit, we living to die—oxymoron
Hope to get to heaven 'til that day arrive
Running through the alley, hope the bullet don't collide
Car window shattered, glass on my right side
Dogs bark in the backyard, rootin' for me

Caught me in the airport dusted that I was thinking
On how to stay rich and get bills with my acquaintances
Yeah, money is the issue, I diss you

'Cause I'm a suitcase king
Cooling at the gambling spot with a screwed face grin
New Beige Bent, we stay winning, play it again, yo
Put the bone in your jaw, now say it again
Round nightfall under the tents, coming to rinse
Get out the way or let the shotty dispense

Got me smiling too

Got the baddest hoes, got the finest weed
Everywhere I goes, they know who I be
Now take a picture, now let me be
Let me do me, let me be a fiend

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
I'm shooting up, everyday I'm tryna ball
With my little China doll, got my back like spinal cord
That pistol on me, yeah that .45
Nigga feeling do or die, fuck tryna be unified
She over there, wanna be over here
So I pull her hair, fuck her from the rear until she there
How are you? Shit, I go by Q
Hey ho, now what it do?
Got a king size and it's built for 2
I been meaning to be leaning up in that pussy
Like Promethazine and she took the semen my willy beaming
On any given Sunday that pussy a runway
She did it the fun way, smash it like Ticante
She did me hombre no need for nombre, we screaming olé and olé
We scored no goalie, she's just a groupie
And group-a, gave top like toupée, bum rushed that coochie
Her pussy lukewarm like long lay, her head be Bombay
Like gin and OJ, took a shot, and I won like gameday
Yes I'm the sensei, comprende? Got a ticket, one way
Oh, you don't really see it that I'm gone?
Pass the baton, black, real rap, spit to the break of the dawn
Nigga we all that, we all that, see that's the shit that we be on
Nigga this Black Hippy, nothing else, beat so bake I'm 'bout to melt
All my shit be prison felt, TDE we got the belt
Hold it down if nothing else, swear to God, on my life
Where it's at? Shit on sight, down to ride, fuck a bike
If I'm locked then fly a kite, keep a strap on like a dyke
TDE we got the belt, hold it down if nothing else
[Hook: Schoolboy Q] (Ab-Soul)
Got the baddest hoes, got the finest weed
Everywhere I goes, got the finest weed
The finest weed, the finest weed
Everywhere I goes, got the finest weed

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Quincy, where the weed at? You know I really need that
You know we go back, 'member when I had you smoking Blacks?
In the back when Top was gone, now Top is back
That mean we in Juice garage, you know you my brethren, we superstars
Still mobbing the 7/11, fuck a car
Top Dawg, ya little fists ain't up to par
Got the baddest hoes, burn the finest kush
That means I'm a botanist slash gynecologist
Please hold your apologies for sleeping, it was prophecy
I just need some time and let these demons climb up out of me
You know the ones that got me sipping these mickeys 'til I'm numb
Having your missis' tongue missing from her mouth, in around my nuts
Ring around the rosie, pocket full of dust bunnies
This hip hop ain't done none for me
Knew I was to be a star when I had a cubby
Watching Ferngully, now everything I puff fluffy and I'm so comfy
Watch the company I keep in case they come for me
All these bitches in your dreams drinking cum from me
This blue dream steam in the lungs of me, oh, buddy (Soul!)10Embed"

Nigga just be wanting all the hoes sometimes. Nigga want every last one of these bitches. Nigga do anything for a bitch. I had to tell the bitch, you nah mean?

[Verse 1]
Look at you, now look at me, now look at him, now back at me
I'm saying tho, I ain't tryna be a nigga, what you playing for?
Came up from the bottom, yeah, that Hoover Figg
Real life fifty niggas, so I like 'em thick
And by looking at your curves, you what I deserve
We can head up to the crib old girl, just say the word
Got some purp, got some Henny, got my penis too
Have you ignoring his calls when you fuck with Q
Drop your panties to the floor, down below your feet
Spread them pretty legs and shit let me see, you should fuck with me, huh

[Bridge]
Man that nigga, that nigga he can't protect ya
Remember when he had left and you took him back from that heffa
And then he did it again and tried to fuck on your friend
And got caught up once with your kin, I'm saying tho

[Interlude]
That nigga like... shit, thirsty for the bitches, sagging my pants and shit. Paid this much for the belt, I better crack a bitch
[Verse 2]
Word around that nigga Q in town

They be like, ""Bitch you bet' not be out with them nigga!""
Oh, oh, soon as she hang up with 'em
She like ""There He Go,"" I be swag from head to toe
Sometimes I ain't gotta hate, she know that my paper grown
Polo shirts and Polo drawers, Polo socks, they matching too
Ooh, with the finest weed, I show you what these OG's do
Super duper triple O, can't see me with a telescope
I just wanna dick her down, tell me what's the verdict though
I just swag so fucking hard, she bringing up her nigga
I beats the pussy up, girl you my main contender

[Bridge]
See you keep bringing up him and then he be hanging with them
And then they be hanging with her when he really should be with you
What I do, see he can't do, this is true
You should tell that nigga you through, I'm saying tho

[Interlude]
Like, nigga like, shit, I don't know, shit, I had to nigga, the bitch was bad, nigga, shit, I had to get that one

[Verse 3]
Fresh up out the studio like ""Can I Live""
Looking for a ho so I can break her ribs
I'm saying tho, I got a couple hundreds, what it's hitting fo'
A rack of condoms and some fire girl lit
Now dim the lights and let me see you do your shit
(Face down, ass up) Fuck me good
Cause ain't no nigga out here fuck you like I could
Grip you by your hand, waist, pillow to face
Satisfaction at its highest point, I set the stakes
Plus, a nigga over there with Tammy and 'em
Giving that bitch all your time, why you deal with him? You oughta win
[Bridge]
See that nigga there is a loser, besides my dick is a ruler
I bring it to ya, and plus he be with them bitches
And treating you like them bitches, you his main or his mistress?

Let me ease your mind, I won't steer you blind
Came right on time, just keep behind
Let me guide the way, it's your lucky day
Let's fornicate, play the way that grown ups play
Teach you how to drive a stick, baby girl, it'll be okay
First gear, second gear, third gear; hell, yeah

Puff my pass into your lust, let me be your doctor
I can please you right, let me give you life

The nexus sits right on the sun, solar eclipse as soon as we cum
Soon as we cum, and a new [?] rest living they dumb
We cruise, you done won my heart over, how can we lose
From a fantasy to real life, you I choose
Came a long way from fucking friends we was due
Ooh, just me and you, ooh, just me and you
Never scared of commitment, see you my boo
We can get ghost, get lost and the bond is true
Flying through the city, clouds reconcile
Saying vows, fuck around and have a child

Uh-huh, yeah, watch me go Black Forest ham
A new school player laced with the old gift gab
And don't let your Shark Week mouth override your Green Goldfish ass
So for every ho you clown, I'mma crown two
And anything good hurts and I cried
Shit I just don't want to throw it up in my mothafuckin' face
Or I choose to not do this around you
See ho you like a brain aneurysm
Want two heads with the same dandruff in 'em
Only to scratch the itch with baby rattlesnake fangs
No Head and Shoulders or anti-venom
Yeah, P, this is gentlemanly leisure, the oldest game left to play
And the hard head that make a soft ass played out
Will forgive and forget yesterday
Now get 'em, Q, a pimp on foot, go to sleep carless, wake up to a Cadillac
Remember Forrest Gump walked and he was pretty stupid
So you know what? Accept the fact that the bitch belongs to the world
P, cause that ho only yours as long as she hoeing
But Happy Pimping and Merry Ho Ho
Keep an eye on bottom bitch too
Cause that bitch'll run a ho or two off, mane
Pimps only fuck with pimps, homie, that's why we so solid
Red to blue, to debt, to due, it's easier
To put a watermelon through the eye of a needle
This is done by choice, not by force
I ain't asking, I'm telling you

Will you sell that pussy for me?
Will you sell that pussy for me? (Will you sell that pussy for me?)

You need a gangsta baby, just tryna give it to ya
(Walking in the dark)
A groovy nigga that's way too G
(Tryna tell you baby!)

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
He might say cuz but he ain't fucking with cuz
Yea I'm Q, but you can call me Quincy
If you want or whatever baby, it's all love
Fuck all that rapping, let me talk to you
Book you a ticket, so we can kick it
Make an escape somewhere we'll be safe
Close your purse, I got my Visa on me
Pick out whatever, it ain't shit but money, turn you to my honey
Take off my Salvatore, wipe your nose for ya
Climb a mountain in the snow for ya
You see these dummies always cut you lose
But so much that a G can do, hit the weed, have a drink or two
I pay attention, I can listen too, you say he fucking who?
Fresh out the shower, let me smell your hair
Garnier Fructis got my knees weak, let's cuddle in these sheets
Let me hold you for a moment, it feels right, don't it?
From a lost child to a woman
Eye contact and soft kisses, strong grip, she want a gangsta, on crip

A 5'3"" stallion
Daddy was from Harlem, her momma was Italian
I don't see the challenge
Of having two girls, you just gotta keep the balance
I told her light that candle
I heard you do yoga, I'm tryna see examples
Your ass is like a handle
See us on the front page, that'll be a scandal
Take off this red shirt, then my flannel
I need some head first, then I'mma fuck you in them sandals
Hit the coochie like a dime sack
Ain't those Gucci, didn't I buy that?
Close your eyes, go and try that
You only live once and I know I got you soaking wet
Thirsty, is the liquor store open yet
I need some Moet to pour it on yo ass like a paint
Back shots leave the pussy shaking, this my open invitation
In the morning, make my toast with fresh orange juice and turkey bacon, bitch

Ain't nobody 'round to judge, go on
Get if off your chest, vent, come up out that dress, bitch
She ain't take offense
Proceeded to take hits of the pregame twist, smoke out, smash
Grub a little bit, pass out, post-game events
Too high to find the remote, fell asleep to a infomercial
Woke up in her mouth, reruns of Full House, followed by some Urkel
OG my strain, rarely do I blaze purple
Some of them growers be in a rush fucking the game up
You gon' learn about all that stuff long as you hang around us
Go on roll up

Backstroke, looking for a quick flood
And you be lying when you say you want our love
Two cups in, and you already lookin' for love

[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
You a cutie and lookin' purty and perfect
What you drinkin'? Feel amazing
Imagine, we get to thinking
I'll explore you and tour you and keep it cordial
She prestigious, the cleanest, I could be dreaming
Fuck my ex is a no-no
Did the love thing and it cost me, she crossed me
Let me work it, you feel your virgin in circles
The groovy Capo, I keep it nasty, attractive
Hit it backwards, do it faster and faster
This a classic
I done mastered the climax, you feel the pressure
Hit it over and over, we doing extra
I can stretch you and fold up
We get to mobbing, bottle popping
I'm stress-free, you gave me options
Life is best in the backseat, ayy
Sunshine give me light
Words ain't soundin' bright
Girl, come and spend a night, ayy
[Chorus]
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk (Woo)
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk
I ain't really drunk, I ain't really drunk

Thank God for the game
My TV screen off the chain
My bitch, she off the chain
I came from the grain
The sidewalk chalk (Yeah)
The block stay hot
Paranoid, the cop that keep my gear in park
Pull me out the car to give me black thought
But fuck it, this shit's all kinda player
This shit my mama flavor
This that raised by your granny, pistols and Now & Laters
Your pops was way too busy, missin' your mom's labor
Grew up just like your daddy to packin' baggies in alleys
To where the streets is your family
Gettin' burnt by the same cop
Go to jail for a year and come home, two of your niggas dropped
You know how that feelin' feel, in the field, when it's gettin' real
More bullets to go around, come jump in this water, nigga
You still with your mama livin', thirty with no ambition
Your kid got no pot to piss in
You sayin' some nigga fake
You're selfish and sad, nigga you're lame (And go on)
You hatin' on another man's success, because
The nigga blessed and wouldn't let you finesse
You got the game all twisted
You're leechin' worse than these ladies, your inner nigga ain't aging
Reason the hood stay shady

Who you do when you want?

No one here, on your own

Smokin' weed for my ills
Breakin' weed in my whip

Still our motive be commas
And still my life isn't promised
Still nervous as drivers
You see them lights get behind us
They pull me out for my priors
Won't let me freeze 'fore they fire
You say that footage a liar
They want my flow in the dryer
I'm at the top aimin' higher
My lawyers stay on retainer
When white folks point the finger
Place my neck on that hanger
Shit, no wonder we riot
Niggas still killin' niggas
Child support killin' niggas
Cops enslavin' us niggas
Little girls killin' mothers
They treat their kid like a brotha
Fathers stuck with them lifers
Kept it real with his niggas, but left his kid for the suckas
Shit, no wonder we bang
Damn shame, mane, some things will never change

I could’ve went D1 but like, I wasn't with it
My SATs and grades was high enough but I wasn't with it
I couldn’t bring my dawgs with me so I wasn't with it
With the biscuit off the counter, me and Floyd get to dumping
Not a drop of blood in us but can't say we ain't cousins
Was on the thizz all week, I think I'm finally recovering
I'll tell you 'bout it, uh

[Verse 2]
How many tears am I gon' shed ’fore I go? Uh
The pigs been on us, my heart been skipping
I lost religion, my nine ain't perfect
A star is born, sometimes a drive by needed
My baby mama paid the bills, I ain't have shit on the smoke
The homies tell me I'm a burden but never threw me a rope
They left me hanging on the corner, my whole life is my stash
One more strike, I'm with the lifers, split the fifty in half
I watch a nigga lose his life right in front of his kids
We keep the cycle back and forth, the demons smother our gifts
They put percentages in front of us, wouldn't give us a chance
The only way that we'll see 30 'less we live in the can
Probably miss my mom funeral, my daughter a ho
Because the man of the house ain't the man no more
And the bitch I call my girl, she done found my dope
I sent her in a deep depression 'til her pulse went ghost
And I just sit and watch from Hell as the pyro grow
So long stuck behind the fire, tryna clown my flow

Front row at the Grammys, I'm getting praises from Jay
Fuck about this award, I'm happy he know my name
Favorite rapper Nas been told me that I'm the best
Had a couple sessions with Dre, knew I would win
Alchemist my favorite producer, and he my friend
All this love from the greats put my passion in pen
Let me tell you 'bout this story, when Quincy died, it had started
I left jail on house arrest and now ever since I've been starvin'
You know pain on my mama's face when the opps can call me a loser
Ain't achieve shit, her son quit sports to become a Crip
'Nother single mother that failed, lost her son in the mix
Workin' hard through all her problems, her son just couldn't be fixed
Got off house arrest, sprinkled some orange in my blue shoes

Baby Love, Baby Spank, Big Spank, Big Fool
The first Figg Side originals, you ain't gotta recruit
Tony Smack, Floyd, G-Scrap, nigga, the main crew
Flossy B was locked in, but was normal, he came through
Nigga, 51st and Figg, on the corner Mayhem was slaughtered
Months later like the shit ain't happen, I'm with my daughter
At the laundromat, the shots rang off, I ducked to the back
Wishin' for a strap but hear more fire from Tiny Rat
Got the devil on my side while the Lord been pushin' me over
I can finally understand why my uncles was never sober
Deadbeat dad on the gas, that gas my motor
Either grab the mic, nigga, grab the same pistola
I can easily tell my story now and climb from this moment
Just imagine Joy hopes if I died next mornin'
Just imagine some of these rappers that ain't have Q
The godfather of this street shit that gave y'all truth
From Pac, Snoop, Kurupt, Daz, bitch, I'm déjà vu
You see my homie in the hood 'cause I hate y'all too, ooh

They eye us as we peel like the, orange hat that I be stylin' in

Then we just go run back to the cheese fulfill our, family needs
No worries, smoke one for our G's that ran with a strike of 3's
We dyin' up in every plea
So for ya'll my niggas swear to god my heart will bleed
Kick the shit for my lifers and ones who kickin' seas

I'ma try to stop thinking with my dickhead for once, ayy
You want some rapper dick for the clout
She wanna be seen when you take her out
You from LA but you made it to the South
Fresh off the flight 'cause you just got flewed out
Damn, find out your Instagram a lie (It's a lie)
You fucked up my vibe (Fucked up my vibe)
Can't fuck with you 'cause I got too much pride (Too much pride)
Go Gucci Mane, get the fuck out my ride

Lifestyles of the kid who never had shit
Living off that bad shit, that shoot shit, that stab shit
Rock a flag and don’t give a fuck about U.S flag shit
George Bush got some nerve, fuck a war, we trying to serve
Motherfucking 8 balls, til’ we live at the pool hall
And knock billiards out of your business, ya bitch
Thats my surroundings in Compton, have common sense
Smell death in the air, around here, thats a common scent
You know the gunpowder
You know when your homie barely blink, he just done powder
Only at seventeen
You know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams
Now hire about street schemes, and getting blood money
I try my best to stay focused and hope the city love me
Pray it's not lust, cause if it is, I’d be death in a month
Lord forbid, for the good kid
They took his life
She want her baby back, like a cooked rib
But that’s just life, where I’m from

[Hook]
If there’s a shining star
Hope my city is not too far
So we can live again
See, where I come from is hard
Hope all over, we can start
So we can live again, so we can live again
[Verse 2: CurT@in$]
I’ve seen this young’un on the train, I had to pick his brain
He said he on his way uptown to get a brick of caine’
He said he needed a come up, because selling nicks' was lame
He needed a change, so I gave him fifty cent
He looked up at me like I was crazy, I said listen man
I rather give you my last to see you live again
Just cause you change what you pitching, don’t make the difference
You gotta get off the mound, and put the game down
Petty thoughts could keep your brain down
I leave you with that jewel, go get the chain now
And put it together
You see coming up, we ain’t have that shit to keep our mind focused
I love Mike, but it was a hassle trying to buy Jordans
My nigga hustle all day in front of the corner store
To get a pair, niggas killed him right in front the mall
So all the hustling for nothing man
I threw my pair on the lightpole because of him
Like fuck it man

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Schoolboy Q]
Trying to move foward, though it never stops
A mother’s son dead, was killed by some kids popped
Shots, they back and forth
Murder for murder, the beef recycled is light
No idols, bunch of unread bibles
Allies that turned to rivals, niggas turned street disciples
Smokers get high as Eiffiels
Addicted to being fiends
Because of the feds as we pledge to let our plague spread
Tiny this and if and that if they banging back
Because they
Adapt to being black, strapped and gang tats, look
Rats get mouse trapped
Can’t afford tuition
But hit a lick I bet I earn crack, I heard that
Looking at the sky, hoping a light would shine
Daylight saving times all the time on this block of mines
All the time with this Glock of mines
Swear to God man it ain’t a rhyme, I grind for a piece of mine
Co-sign
[Hook]

[Bridge/Outro: Black Ice]
When you look at my brothers, what's your first impression?
Does the sight of us leave you guessing?
Or do you understand the stressing, the aggression
The look of no hope on my niggas' faces
Like the Lord overlooked us when He handed down His graces
See embraces, fall short on the numb tips of street entrepeneur fingers
Stuck in the walls of the project halls where the Coke smell still lingers -
External blingers is all we can be
Cause on the inside we been given nothin to shine on
And the gig is harder to get than Coke so niggas get their grind on
Because the TV tells us aim high Nigga, make all goals lateral
But that takes paper that we don't have so niggas put their souls up as collateral
Now, some niggas reclaim 'em, some blame 'em
Making excuses to sell 'em
But when a nigga goes from not doin', to doin'
What can you tell him?
Not to be a nigga?
Shit I gots to be a nigga that's how I pay the bills and I'mma do that whether I gotta sling this coke or exploit these rhyme skills

Easy going, she a freak bro
Livin' my life, nigga, ain't simple

Lying on their letter signs, but hurry cause they close at nine

Rapping on them corners, a.m., p.m., like the Taliban
Camping out, your daddy selling money he can understand

As a younger age, never really gave a shit
Just my grandma arms, kept me out of harm
Nigga went to class, my football pads
Kept the burner stashed, they ain't gon' catch my ass
In the Pontiac with the bad speakers
Back then? Shit, I was into sneakers
And fitted caps, side kicks
My same bitch, she a down bitch
Had a little daughter, glad it ain't a boy
Knew she'd bring me joy, so I named her Joy
Kiss her on her head, then I kiss her lips
Then I kiss her cheek, lay her down to sleep
Trials and tribulations helped me through my situations
Little observations stopped the cops from confrontations
And the ghetto bird, and a nigga snitched
But I'm still dipping, shit, I ain't tripping

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Sample]
I’m good (""If I had my way"")
I’m good (""I would do all [?] everyday"")
I’m good (""If I had my way"")
I’m good (""I would do all [?] everyday"")

[Post-Chorus: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I know, I’m not perfect
But I'll still make a decision that make
My life still worth it—yeahh-ah
And sometimes it may hurt
But I know what you see ain’t what it's gon' be because
I know my worth—yeahh-ahhh

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Got a lil' older, nigga seen a lot of shit
Been out in Boston, even got to see the Knicks
I've been to Dallas, slap a five with the bench
Back to the hood where niggas betting on the six
But shit is crazy
Lil' Teisha and Tamika bout to kill they babies
Pregnant at the same time, and they think that shit is cute
Always running from the truth, bigger dream they must pursue
And they babies wasn't in it
Just going bout they business in the club
She off of Guinness, adioses with the lemon
V.I.P. she dreams of, in the club looking for mean buzz
In a dress looking distinctive
Ass hanging, got that ass hanging with the biggest baller in the club
Ain't got a dub, but she want some love
Wasn't polite, but she feel it's right (feel it's right)
Lay it down, then he dimmed the lights, played it right for the night

[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Sample]

I’m good (""If I had my way"")

But I'll still make a decision that make
My life still worth it—yeahh-ah
And sometimes it may hurt
But I know what you see ain’t what it's gon' be because
I know my worth—yeahh-ahhh


[Verse 3: Punch]
Uh, ignorance is bliss, but to know is pain
No matter what we reap, we still sow the same
The concept of change is second-rate to change
Either way around, the cycle still remains
Out my project window, observing the wannabes blowing endo
Shooting dice on the corner, big homie roll up with his kinfolk
Unfold a stack on 'em like, what they hitting for?
Slamming the doors on his Benzo
He left the engine running, bumping something sounding like
Late eighties R&B, trunk full of China white
Type of nigga ladies like, known dope dealer
Money, cash, hoes getter, slash stone cold killer
He can't sleep at night, his victim's eyes piercing through his soul
He wake up every time his eyes close
That's who them young boys aspire to see
Underneath the palm trees, that's who they dying to be
But I'm good
[Chorus: ScHoolboy Q + Sample]
I’m good (""If I had my way"")
I’m good (""I would do all [?] everyday"")
I’m good (""If I had my way"")
I’m good (""I would do all [?] everyday"")

Fuck around and get a tattoo (vroom!)
Had me dumpin' out the sun roof (roof!)
Consequences you done ran through
Caught his ass slipping, looking pretty in them sandals (haha!)
Keep them gangsters to the streets
You know the shit was handled
10 speed, handle bar shift, Astro fit
Hopped off with a message in the clip
Inboxed read ""third verse!""
Heading to the third

Tired of living no healthcare, I ain't fucking with wellfare
But its rap down, Hells near, Sherm on every corner like fountains near
G rock, mountaineer, chunk coats a cop would wear, double up, roca wear
Win or lose, none to spare, black jack safety pair
20 rounds one to the head, whole clip strike the beard
Breaking news fuck the feds, buckle up, simon says
Do the job nothing says, neighbors seen this shit for years
Hopped out, out of range, close up not a stain
Gut shot got him maimed, shit bag potty trained

No time for a nigga, got a strike up on my record
And I'm playing shit for what its gonna be
A nigga sitting on his last hundred plus I owe the homie 50
And my bitch and she ridin' on E
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
[Verse 2]
Nigga welcome to Hell's kitchen, prayers missing
Doing good has no intentions, with the shit that I'm kicking
Heavens too far from forgiving
Stuck on a mission, Choppers by the windows
See the silhouettes, just like I'm heading fishing
Pay your rent or meet your soul's eviction, greet the reaper
Deliver death like serving pizza, dome piece the shell cracked like Sunday Easter
Feel this Ether, the pyromaniac, you niggas keisters
Ain't shit but ass, newest task is getting cash
Smoking hash and let it ash, off a dime like Steve Nash
22 by my lower calf, see a hawk, we sqeeze and blast
(Hahaha) Fucking laugh, shady more than aftermath
Eminem's my limit slim, we ain't the same no synonym
No sin in them, get it in like lucifer, down and dirty emperor
With hell's demons and angels, rat-a-tat-tat-tat sent for ya
I major in your minisher, left his ass holy by the minister
Immortal Kombat finisher

[Hook]
No time for a nigga, got a strike up on my record
And I'm playing shit for what its gonna be
A nigga sitting on his last hundred plus I owe the homie 50
And my bitch and she ridin' on E
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
Somebody gotta die, a body for a body, nigga, shit I'm feeling kamikaze
[Verse 3]
Gangster, Gangster! Read all about it, a nigga got smoked
The killers name remains silent
Gangster, Gangster! Read all about it, there's guns in the streets
I know the governments supplying
Prison wars, race riot, ice pick in the neck, flatline
Another comic grave for man kind
Every step I take a land mine, blowin' up like 9-11, Hiroshima, Pearl Harbor
Afghan hobbies, got me feelin' Kamikaze (KABOOM) blow up the party
Sickest lad-i-dadi,peace on Earth you dont remind me
Dying Honor, Uni-bomber, you prima donna I'm ghetto verson of Gia Connor
Mob bosses, count losses gain profits, same logic
Did it all but still stay silent, keep the gangster grooving in my blood cuz'
50's who I do it for, die for mine and ride on yours

I got bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody fully loaded better watch your step
You keep running your mouth, or I'm hiding where you slept
Bet you be hog-tied and die for fucking with a red
Do this for my niggas, bet they say it's worth it
So I don't leave the studio not until it's perfect
Can't you see I'm grinding, can't you see I'm working
Down to give this motherfuck the life and that's for certain
Sipping on that lean, same color as Easter
This weed Halloween, hi it's nice to meet ya
Checking out my steelo, it's on another
Couple hundred kilo, spend it with my brother

[Hook]
I got a hundred mothafuckers and it's﻿ cracking (crack)
Everybody do know my situation was happening (happen)
Bitches on my right, gangstas on my left
Everybody wave your rag around and bang the set

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
I got﻿ money in my wallet, money in my pocket
Burner in my hand, so you better watch it
Bitch, I am the man tryna make a profit
Hope you understand, nigga what's ya logic?
Sagging in my jeans because I'm gutta
Fresh as Listerine, and still I'm gutta
Bitch I'm bout my paper, I'm bout that butter
Roll me up a blunt, time for another
Everybody paper chasin', working on a situation
Giving bitches penetration, Houston rocking, got it popping
Niggas like to catch a fade ever seen a nigga drop
Coup the wrap, pollute the block
Cock it back then shoot the cop
Flee the scene then get the cream
Then go split it with my team
Live my life and live it right
Shit I'm the homie with a mic
The homies out here ain't nice
Earn they stripes, serving white
Shaving coke, nigga what you living for?

Nigga finally on another page
Glock forty or the gauge (fade)
Hit a nigga with a blade, lay down, blocka
Then go around, blocka
Then another, take cover, black zip covers
Pass the deacon speakin', say the briefing
I know I left that nigga leaking
I know I coulda let him slide
But shit I'd rather slide a nigga
Forty-five a nigga
Shots will dive inside a nigga
Clean and sanitize a nigga
Smooth operator, Under-layer
Fast forward them shots and those who play us
Got love for my haters
And garcia Vegas
I put a dub in that it keeps my mind free of mazes
See my rhymes still amazes
Amazing ass nigga here to lick and pass nigga
Scheme ass on blast nigga
You say you doing bad, nigga what you lying for
Better get your chopper and then turn this bitch to Rambo

Hood on, shoot till they drop nigga
We'll be waiting for you 'round the corner nigga

[Verse 1]
Only 12 and a half and already ducking them jabs
Fighting back, just hoping that he last, he on his ass
Huffing and puffing, getting tagged
See what this nigga feel, would only make them niggas laugh
He felt the discomfort, ain't trust them right away
Saw the devil in they eyes, his homie looking straight
But something was different in him, not the same from yesterday, shit
His whole demeanor changed, even his smile was strange, his childhood
Never came, but dude was always gutter, he got it from his brother
From his brother from his brother, brought pain onto his mother
Once was elementary homies but now we attack each other
Shit set love aside, took his pride, shit he had to ride
Threw on his hood and then he fired
Fired and fired, fired and fired, the tires screech
Spirit of up out of reach, a young nigga's swallowing yeast
Trapped in the belly of the beast, sheesh
[Hook]
I know niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues, the cycle continues (Kill nigga, Kill nigga)
[Verse 2]
He only 17, his homies was his motive
He only 17, his momma never noticed
Too busy paying bills, tryna provide a meal
Pay the rent and steal, her child live for a thrill
Fulfill his niggas wishes, no more hugs and kisses
No more ""How you been,"" no more tucking in
He with them other men, poppa never came
So his cousin dem would pretend, imitating if they was him
Got the pistol on him, loaded, loaded off of gin
Feels like niggas on him, so he look for them
First nigga wrong hat? Blam-blam to him
Paranoia kills, kill or be killed
Let alone all them thugs, let alone all them drugs
Treat his kind like a bud, let's see how karma does
Let's see how much he loves, shoot him up, shoot him up, bam-bam

[Hook]
I know niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues, the cycle continues (Kill nigga, Kill nigga)
Know niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas, that kill niggas
The cycle continues, the cycle continues (Kill nigga, Kill nigga)

[Verse 3]
This nigga 21, he feel like he the man
This nigga 21, his mom said ""be a man""
Love to sag his pants, pistol in his hand
Feel he too advanced, him slipping out his chance
Think he at his best, he hit the set he making orders
Got them little niggas busting shots and flipping quarters
An ounce, a half, double up, shit what you order
Even dimes, think with a corrupted mind
Adapted to them crimes, living with regrets
In order to survive, gotta get high
Cautious with time, paranoia hard through his body
Trying love for a hobby, you know gangsters come with kids
Teaching them wasn't his
EBT the corner store, he go fill up the fridge
Approached by a little nigga, hoodie over his lid, looking down a barrel
Of a burner tucked, aimed at his wig, let him fire, then he fire

Trying to bring her home with me tonight
Look in the sky might see me waving girl
El capitán ain't no saving girl

Playa playa fly away
Playa playa fly away
Playa playa fly away

[Verse 1]
Ladies show your titties
Freak me with your panties off
She heard I run the city
And stay dressed in the finest clothes
So playeristic who be? I'm that mayne
I tripped and stumbled into this rap game
And turned my struggles into a fortune
No wonder why these hoes good for nothing
Just turned me texting into some fucking
You know I get it, I did it way before I'm thirty
Oh I get it, now I attract to those who curvy
Oh I get it, I'm living what these niggas talking bout
She want a baller, a nigga that ain't in his momma's house
Knowing he wrong, out here sneak fucking on his momma's couch
Nigga I'm grown, boy you keep playing she gon' throw you out
See that there ain't the life of a playa boy I tell ya
Calling all the ladies, if you're sexy and you know it
Bring that pussy over here, I'm not a square
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All my playa partnas ballin' stuntin' what's I call it
All my soldiers up but nigga we ain't fallin'
I'm gettin' paper but I still prefer a blunt
Backwood that good and you know my system thump
I'm turnin, my closet be fly as hell, my soul's burnin'
Playa playa, on ritz is that shit we been on
I'm at the Ritz with a big body bitch to lay on
Ain't turnin' tricks, wrappin' my dick, give her a gift
Give her a bar, give her a spot, give her a lift
See life's a bitch so fuck your world while I exist
I'm drunk and faded turning saints to lunatics
Yo what's the word?
Yo excuse me if I slur, but you need what you deserve
Calling all the ladies, if you're sexy and you know it
Give this playa here your rear
Now drop it for me, pause for me

[Verse 3]
Sippin' Henn, no ice cause I ain't tryin' to chill
Everybody taking molly, I'm still off a pill
Straight up off of Figg into a record deal
Fuck paying a tuition, rather pay these bills
Go from bank to bank and state to state for shows
Two chicks go mouth to mouth to make my penis grow
I don't care about nothin' but pussy hoes
So now you frontin' why you playin' with that pussy fo'?
To my playas don't you hate a reform ho?
Tryin' to act like that my nigga Soul ain't hit before
She fucked K.Dot, even let Jay rock
Going nowhere fast in the same spot
It's a party over here, nothin' goin' over there

If you're horny and you know it give that one you want a stare
Now drop it for me, pause for me

""Don't look at me goddammit!
Ayo Q, you want a piece of this?""

[Verse 1: Schoolboy Q]
City filled with this filthy air
Evil pump in my blood, how dare you to stare
Never felt fair, no room for a tear
Come on dump, don't give a fuck if the coast clear
Jacket cover the ratchet, pants hang to my calf
Burner over the ab, sendin' shots under your jab
You really wanna diss me?
Believe it like Ripley when I'm off the fifth of whiskey
Damaging my kidney, I wish a nigga tempt me
Then it's all bad, leave his parents all sad
Cops with a mystery, murderin' ain't shit to me
This a killing symphony, my nigga, for real
I still keep the weapon concealed, body will spill
Hollow tips stuck in your grill, give a fuck how you feel
Tired of resisting this murder addiction
Fuck a conviction, bust shots, slaughter conviction
Lucifer soul, my temperature cold
Eyes blood shot, throwin up blood clots, body in shock
I need me a doc, but I figure I'm too sick
Fuck it, adrenaline pumping may lead in to something
Assumption on life is still, livin' a trife
Asthmatic causing havoc, keep spazzin' til my brain get damaged
Still remain most scandalous, that bang hammers
Fuck surveillance, shit, murk in front of cameras
Dump 'em in the sand like tan or big blands
More grammar shit, I'm the illest motherfucker
Verse 2: [Kendrick Lamar]
Splash blocks like Dikembe when I sensai, who wanna shoot?
The liquor hear me, I'm off the Remy like Papoose
I got the truths of a thousand bishops
Troops of a thousand niggas, you can get your ass missing
Like a white bitch with big tits to be specific
I'm over they heads when the words get pledged
Fright night, gun tucked tight like a newborn
Dance with the Devil, hopefully you get your groove on
When I blaze this metal
Like a rolling stone, flesh and bones come out
Like a thug reunion, watch yall dumb out
Most likely, half of you fraudulent niggas don't like me
Scared to fight me even if you had hands just like me
K Dot, bare arms like a haltertop
Live from the barbershop, who want a fade?
Who want war? I got a drawer full of hand grenades
Take it back to them Contra days, so fall back
It's real, off cognac, and pills, we twist caps then peel
Bananas with the hammers, play if you will
A bullet proof for a shield, that won't work
I got big big very big big bullets, and they hurt
Lift up your skirt if you play pussy, don't push me, I'm light
You pushing up daisies, if the pump do a push up tonight
I put, I put a new price on your head, like a mannequin dressed well
Students from Harvard can hear the nigga Yale
I'm cold hearted, oh well
I get's retarded, the yellow bus I'm a park it
In front of your house, hop out, gun in ya mouth (Blakka!)
Duck shows in your peek hole, me and my Hoover crip
But all I bang is your bitch, don't get me twist
Let's do this, I'm ludicrous, disturbing the peace
Pacing back and forth like a stewardess, it's plain to see
Da Evils

Nigga figured out my life while
Grown child, damn, life’s a bitch so I don’t smile
Still puffin’ herb just to lower my eyebrows
Eye lashes, eyes close, ears open, gun smokin’
Worst pokin’, rap’s quoting
Close your eyes to the vibe, see the pigs floating
Not a dog, kid I’m the shit, see the rhyme potent
Hmm… Never wanted to hit you with the lies
Working on my gift just to better my surprise
Tatted up my face just to better my disguise
And I’m still ghetto in the hood, chilly with the fries
Put that on the fifties, oh this rap shit is simply
Easier, fingertips greasier name in the media, encyclopidea
And this rap im spittin’ I get it in sentences
Im lyrically sentenced behind bars

[Hook]
Beat dope, flow tight guess a nigga go with the fast life
Sounds like, like Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, work for something to something
To Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop yeah made a little dough from the fast life
Now im on the mic trying to spread lights it sounds like, like
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop, made something from nothing with
Hip-Hop, Hip-Hop
[Verse 2]
These white folks they ain't care how I grew up
Gang signs threw up
Lifestyle blew up, travel different hoods
Every other curb knew us
Managed by the Bloods, though I still bang Hoover
Spittin that manure
Watch how I maneuver, buzz down in Cuba, flow like a lunatic
See the wrist iced out in this bitch, niggas know the world is mine
So your life in my fist, life real
Grinding hard just to pay the light bills
Spitting with aggression just imagine how my mic feels
Understandable why these niggas call me Hannibal Lecter
Blacked up fuck around, dissect you, top dogs protect you
Nobody is better, I give a lecture to the rest of the semester
No sleep, eyes wide open, just to let my brain speak
G-E-D Top Dog E-N-T

Beat dope, flow tight guess a nigga go with the fast life

[Verse 3]
Huh so hip-hop got me rapped in
Punch opened up the back door, and then I crept in
Let’s in all this so nonsense rapping
Knowing that I’m living every single track I’m giving in
Paying Gucci for tuition, learn to play your position
Murdered the competition, taking you on a mission
A journey to big dreams, my life in a sixteen
We trying to trap cream, I’m done with these dope fiends
Seen

[Outro]
I don't know what it is, I don’t know
K. Dot uglier than a bitch
Punch what he do, got a bald head (laughing)1Embed"

I think my pressure boiling from all the shit that's spoiling
Uh, I once was on it but now my head's enormous
Uh, your shit was boring, my art is fast and forming
Creativity is what you lack in your performance
You see the crowd nigga? Microphone checker
Mr. Home Wrecker, give me hard liquor
Let the blunt flicker, you see my style evolve
Reservoir Dogs and we some Hannibals
If I would catalog, feeling phenomenon
I'm after the Parmesan, while gripping my fire arm
Bang, he lost an arm, bang, he writing nothing
Nigga you wasting time, I'm wasted, past the line, I'm hard
My nig, you whine, you broke, my nig, you lying, you owe
You buying dimes, look my nig, we know the signs
But quick to speak our minds, fronting like you balling man
I couldn't tell, Hell, smoking more than what your dealer sell
Huh, super fail, super duper fail
Listen to the Schoolboy, my mic can teach you well, Hell
Hah, left him at a pit stop
Top Dawg, mothafuck your hip hop

[Hook]
Mothafuck your hip hop
Mothafuck your hip hop
You ain't gotta cop it when my shit drop?
Mothafuck your hip hop
[Verse 2: Big Pooh]
They don't wanna see you shine, they don't wanna see you grow
They don't wanna see you sign on that line and get doe
Wanna keep you in they pocket, I fire like a rocket
I'm tryna blow up, like sticking forks in the socket
I did it for the love, I do it for the art
Now how am I supposed to write these 16's in the dark?
My car's on park, I can't eat skills
And props ain't gon' pay all these mothafuckin' bills
I can keep it real and get paid at the same time
Money in my pocket won't reflect on my next line
Next rhyme, next date, showing off my chest plate
Belly big, looking all full, cause I just ate
Know some shit been going wrong if I lost weight
Ain't about the doe, but I need it now, won't wait
Can't stop, won't stop, not even a drip drop
Say what you want but mothafuck your hip hop

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Murs]
They say, ""Murs why you put Dogg Pound on Paid Dues and shit?
Must have gone mainstream, sold out losing it""
Niggas that's been underground for years and ain't doing shit
My homies ain't no B-boys fool, all they do is Crip
Keep on talking shit and they gon' sock you in the lip
And you gon' do is get mad and try to sue a pimp
Then I'm spending loot on a lawyer that's ludicrous
Cashing out my street cred for you? Man, I'm through with this
I'm a changed man, that's the only reason you exist
If this was '96 we would have caught you in a twist
The little homies busting at you out the Bronco
Peel your cap ten kick back at the compost
Large orange bang and a bomb plate of nachos
Bitter broke nigga, quit hating, keep your mouth closed
Rapping 30 years, you still ain't this hot
Shut your ass up nigga, mothafuck your hip hop

Have a seat, this bullet pierce your shirt
Ain't nothing sweet, you'll see a star burst
I keep orange laces in my Converse
Off house arrest, now hear this converse
I draw my pistol on my hip, you see that rubber grip
Don't have a half a clue, them boxes for hollow tips
I've got more Oxy than a pharmacy
Also, I keep action clips, when I move E
Yeah, I swear to God won't find a nigga like him
I greet 'em, pop 'em, then I As-salamu alaykum 'em
Heaven or Hell your only ultimatum
Hit a pussy for his lip ring, my niggas murder
No attempting - got blasted

Jump up on my wee-wee
Oh oh, go jump up on my wee-wee
Fuck me on my ten speed
Gangsta of the century
Tell Rocky I want Iggy
This niggas getting rail road
Take yo' bitch ass to the nail shop
Ring ring from the gun shots
Brings her shoes back from the bailhop
This year from the gun loving, shit firin' and the migos
This here from the real lo' true Figg side gang deebo
[-] I remember you, he was way aside being turned down
In supermax getting supermax
With your hip gold and your nose ground
Hellbound I don't fuck 'round
[ - ]  my name on your building
And I'm suicide to the children
I speak crimes to the millions
All night won't sound like
Pitchfork, no website
All night, what's this like

[Part 2:]
Look at his head splitted
Nigga de-de-did it
Booyah, lil nigga gon' make me go double digits
Cause he murked up the block
My magnun go outta lock
My forty controlling your nina
Still on the wigg shot
When we had no pot to piss in
We would implot the mission
Took me right out the mission
Tookie right out commission
Murder, mo murder, mo murder
Murder, mo murder, mo
Keep on [- -] bitches
And snitches they gotta go
Money, mo money, mo money
