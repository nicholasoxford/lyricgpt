Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

[Verse 1]
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

[Verse 2]
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Never, never, never, never let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia) Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me!

[Verse 4]
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn

And the night followed day
And the storytellers say
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day
Sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried

Though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you?
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew

Came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news
Of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the Earth is old and grey
Little darlin', we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years are gone
Though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes from your eyes cry to me

Ooh, give me a little time to choose
Water babies singing
In a lily-pool delight
Blue powder monkeys
Praying in the dead of night

[Chorus]
Here comes the Black Queen
Poking in the pile
Fie-Fo the Black Queen, marching single file
Take this, take that
Bring them down to size
(March to the Black Queen)
[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Put them in the cellar
With the naughty boys
A little bit of sugar
Then a rub-a dub-a baby oil

[Chorus]
Black on, black on
Every finger nail and toe
We've only begun, begun
Make this, make that
Keep making all that noise
(Oooh, march to the Black Queen)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, now I've got a belly-full
You can be my sugar-baby
You can be my honey-chile, yes

[Guitar Solo]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
A voice from behind me reminds me
Spread out your wings, you are an angel
Remember to deliver with the speed of light
(A little bit of love and joy)
Everything you do bears a will
And a why and a wherefore
(A little bit of love and joy)
In each and every soul
Lies a man and very soon
He'll deceive and discover
But even till the end of his life
He'll bring a little love
[Verse 4]
I reign with my left hand
I rule with my right
I'm lord of all darkness
I'm Queen of the night
I've got the power
Now do the march of the black Queen
My life is in your hands, I'll fo and I'll fie
I'll be what you make me
I'll do what you like
I'll be a bad boy, I'll be your bad boy
I'll do the march of the Black Queen
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 5]
Walking true to style
She's vulgar, 'buse, and vile
Fie-fo the Black Queen tattoos all her pies
She boils and she bakes
And she never dots her i's
(She's our leader)

[Instrumental break]
[Outro]
Forget your singalongs and your lullabies
Surrender to the city of the fireflies
Dance with the devil in beat with the band
To hell with all of you hand-in-hand
But now it's time to be gone
(La la la la forever) forever
Ah ah ah ah ah

We just lived for fun

You can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?

On a roller coaster ride

No use in sitting and thinking
On what you did
When you can lay back
And enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately
I just don't know
Better sit back and go with the flow

They've flown in the swiftness of time

About growing up and what a struggle it would be

Where I went wrong

Oh-oh, people of the earth
""Listen to the warning,"" the seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hand on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare
I watched as fear took the old man's gaze
Hopes of the young in troubled graves

[Pre-Chorus]
""I see no day,"" I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal

Summoned by your own hand
Oh-oh, children of the land
Quicken to the new life, take my hand
Ooh, fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove
[Verse 2]
He told of death as a bone white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late, all the wretches run
These kings of beasts now counting their days
From mother's love is the son estranged
Married his own, his precious gain

[Pre-Chorus]
The earth will shake, in two will break
And death all around will be your dowry

For those who hear and mark my words
Listen to the good plan

And two by two, my human zoo
They'll be running for to come
Running for to come out of the rain

Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you
Should death await you

Out of control
And you think you're so strong

And there's nothing you can, nothing you can
Nothing you can do about it

Meets a white hot lady
(Hoop diddy diddy, hoop diddy do)
Soon the fire starts raging
Gets you more than half crazy

Everywhere you turn
You can't start walking
Cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Because reason's out of the window
Better hold on tight

Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all good company

Take care of those you call your own
And keep good company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day with Sally J
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her
Won't you keep me company?

Oh, marry me for evermore
We'll be good company

Now marriage is an institution sure
My wife and I, our needs and nothing more
All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts
My own limited company

I hardly noticed Sally
As we parted company

[Bridge]
All through the years
In the end, it appears
There was never really anyone but me

But no one's there to see
I ponder on the lesson of

You say you love me

Oh, how I could love you
If I could let you stay

It's late, it's late, it's late, but not too late

Is the sweetest love around
But after all this time, the more I'm trying
The more I seem to let you down
Now you tell me you're leaving
And I just can't believe it's true
Oh, you know that I can love you
Though I know I can't be true
Oh, you made me love you
Don't tell me that we're through

(It's late) But it's driving me so mad
(It's late) Yes, I know
But don't try to tell me that it's

You can't turn out the lights
(So late) I've been wrong
But I'll learn to be right

You're staring at me
With suspicion in your eye
You say what game are you playing?
What's this that you're saying?
I know that I can't reply
If I take you tonight
Is it making my life a lie?
Oh, you make me wonder
Did I live my life right?

(It's late) Ooh yes, I know
But there's no way it has to be

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead

But now I've gone and thrown it all away

If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

A helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care
Inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man
Is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

Where the rays of the sun
Were so warm and tender
Now haven't anything to grow (Ahh)

It's the sad-eyed goodbye
Yesterday moments I remember
It's the bleak street
Weak-kneed partings I recall

It's the mistier mist, the hazier days
The brighter sun and the easier lays

[Chorus]
There's all the more reason
For laughing and crying
When you're younger
And life isn't too hard at all

[Verse 2]
It's the fantastic drowse
Of the afternoon Sundays
That bored you to rages of tears
The unending pleadings
To waste all your good times
In thoughts of your middle-aged years

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a vertical hold
All the things that you're told
For the everyday hero
It all turns to zero
[Chorus]
And there's all the more reason
For living or dying
When you're young
And your troubles are all very small

[Bridge]
Out here on the street
We'd gather and meet
And scuff up the sidewalk
With endlessly restless feet
And half of the time
We'd broaden our minds more
In the pool hall than we did
In the school hall
With the downtown
Chewing-gum bums
Watching the nightlife
The lights and the fun

[Verse 3]
Never wanted to be the boy next door
Always thought I'd be something more
But it ain’t easy for a smalltown boy
It ain’t easy at all

Thinkin' it right, doin' it wrong
It's easier from an armchair
Waves of alternatives wash at my sleepiness
Have my eggs poached
For breakfast I guess
I think I'll be Clint Eastwood
Oh no, Jimi Hendrix, he was good
Let's try William the Conqueror
Now who else do I like?
