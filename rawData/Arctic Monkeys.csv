Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

[Chorus]
Crawlin' back to you
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too
Busy bein' yours
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you
[Verse 2]
So have you got the guts?
Been wonderin' if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down an' pucker up, I'm sorry to interrupt
It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

[Pre-Chorus]
(Do I wanna know?) If this feelin' flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go) Was sorta hopin' that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know) That the nights were mainly made
For sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawlin' back to you (Crawlin' back to you)
Ever thought of callin' when
You've had a few? (Had a few)
'Cause I always do ('Cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (Maybe I'm too busy)
Busy bein' yours (Bein' yours)
To fall for somebody new
Now, I've thought it through
Crawlin' back to you

(Do I wanna know?) Too busy bein' yours to fall

If it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

Stop and wait a sec
When you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked

[Verse 2]
Not shy of a spark
The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start

In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs

But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with ""Goodbye""
I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon

Now you only get it in your night dress

Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole

That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?

Oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem, aren't as daft as they seem

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
Clinging 'till I'm getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?

Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Woah, ah

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days

Incapable of makin' alright decisions

In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night

And your dreams just aren’t comin' true

So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because

To do me no good
And you look like you could

Floating down the endless stream of great TV

And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?

When I asked her if I could call her your name

Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely

And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
""No, you can't call me her name""

You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are

Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling, have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe

[Chorus]
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest
I pretend that you were just some lover

[Verse 2]
Now I can't think of there without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide

[Chorus]
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easier
To pretend that you were just some lover
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?
Will I have found a better method of
Pretending you were just some lover?35Embed"

""Shall I keep rolling?""

[Verse 1]
Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there in't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see 'em then you would agree
Agree that there in't no romance around there

[Chorus]
You know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

[Verse 2]
'Cause over there there's broken bones
There's only music so that there's new ringtones
And it dun't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead
[Chorus]
Don't you know? Oh, it's a funny thing, you know
We'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen, because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

But I said no, oh no
Well, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go
Oh, no, no

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
But over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way

Said, not in the same way

I want an interesting synonym
To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in

Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get ahold

They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

[Chorus 2]
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold

And the days she deemed dull
Leading to nights reading beer bottles

How he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
He makes examples of you, and there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realise then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant? Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
Well, secretly I think they want you all to kick off
They want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
It's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah

And weightless, your imagination runs

As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow

Shortly after he showed you what it was

Everything I touched told me
It would be better shared with you, with you

And this book reveals your face

I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms
It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean

[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna hang on

[Verse 2]
I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd spend it chasing after you
'Cause she's not shattering my attitudes
No matter how she folds the potion
Yours is the only ocean

Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do

Linking arms, sinking hearts
And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes

Where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
Where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires

Past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks

In a dusty black coat with a red right hand

[Verse 2]
He'll wrap you in his arms and tell ya that you've been a good boy
He'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
He'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
And there won't be a single thing that you can do
He's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru

They're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
But hidden in his coat is a red right hand

Through the ghetto and the barrows
And the Bowery and the slums

Caused pure madness in the end, I mean day and night
We robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
Smoking, drinking, drag riding
Drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
Reckless youngsters, no direction, no sign of correction
But then I switched it off, changed my ways
Run the area like, ""Oh, my days""
But a lot of my naughty friends, they're not phased
Can't believe that this music pays
See no reason why we can't do
All the things that we've always done
Still in my heart I know that's just one

In softly came the growl from both sides
And if his whisper splits the mist
Just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
Nice try
You cannot turn away, but nice try
Turned your legs to little building blocks
And with his index finger, flicks you on your socks

[Verse 2]
I go high-pitched
He'll talk and make your voice sound high-pitched
Dread to think if he got you on your own
And whispered in your ear in that baritone
It's the same stone
His heart was cut out of the same stone
That they used to carve his jaw
It's impossible not to feel inferior

[Chorus 1]
And he could catapult you back to your daddy
Or into any hissing misery
And he will tell you how the day after a triumph
Is as hollow as the day after a tragedy
He'll extinguish any chance of escape
When he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
And he's leaving without saying bye

And you will queue up to listen to him pissing
And hang around to watch some poor girl blub
And then they chase him down the avenue
Incessantly pestering him to let him join the club

And just how to shut up the charming ones of us
And I've seen him talking to your lady friend

Where he'll teach you all the bits they missed

Would you tell me where you're gonna take it?
If I had a heart, you're the one who should break it
The engine's running
Can't decide if I should ride away

[Chorus: Richard Hawley & Alex Turner]
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I
You and I

[Verse 3: Richard Hawley]
I like the way you look at me, baby
Please don't try to turn out the lights
I act as if I'm not going crazy
But girl, I'm in a muddle tonight6Embed"

One, two, three, four! (Roll that faster, man)
One, two, three, four!
(Oh, we gotta time that
The whole point of a count is that it's in time, innit?)
One, two, three, four!

[Verse 1]
Well, I watch you tangle every weekend
It might start different but it ends up the same
One minute, you're casually speaking
The next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
With your jerrycan of words and tones

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say
Apparently

[Chorus]
Oh, he said, settle for the draw
Well, you're not gonna get no more
So you should settle for a draw
I told you once I'm sure, I told you once I'm sure
You should settle for a draw
Why don't you settle for a draw?
[Verse 2]
Well, you're right, it is one set of rules for her
And then another set for you
But that's just the way it is, I suppose
And there's nowt you can do
And let's not fall in the trap of answering back
I am just a beginner but she'll be the only winner
That's for sure, so take the draw, if it's available
And if it sets on fire
Don't get out your jerrycan of words and... tones

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
And no one's gonna start a revolution
So we best leave it well alone
And there's something that Frankie used to say

So you should settle for the draw
I told you once I'm sure, I told you once I'm sure

When I got back from fixing my hair
You were directing the traffic
Letting your story slip on the snow
As if the transmission was automatic
It's arguable that I shouldn't've been there
It was fortunate timing
I had a hole in the pocket of my favourite coat
And my love dropped into the lining

[Chorus]
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me

[Verse 2]
You can't sleep until you've sat on the steps
To weep 'til you feel like you've wept, yeah
(As long as you don't forget your strange)

[Chorus]
(Have you got your strange?) No, not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me
I haven't got my strange
I've better fetch my strange

007 and Brucey Wayne
Are shitting them sens because there's another name
Coming to claim what is his to claim
Ten percent faster with a sturdier frame
He's certainly come into his own
There's one on his arm in every land that he roams
And two consecutive nights alone
Are a thing of the past as he has recently shown

[Chorus]
They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last
Are two things you'll never be, my darling

[Verse 2]
Another roll around and another push and shove
Further away from the idea of love
And his conclusion, it must be good
Or when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud
Forgot to kick the tin
He knows where she's going, but don't know where she's been
And as opposed to the other thing
He'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in
[Chorus]
They said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
Drawing you in like it's boring to him
It's a war you can't win and the first and the last
Are two things you'll never be, my darling
(Two things you'll never be, my darling)
Two things you will never be, my darling
(Two things you'll never be, my darling)

[Outro]
Well, he sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up-lines
Not to feel like a twat at times, it's hard
But not for this kid, not when they come to you2Embed"

With your short sharp tips
No, I won't read your lips right now

You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you?
And you're looking pretty suspicious
And probably planning a heist
He's wanting to go to the strippers
It makes him feel all nice

The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and

Smacking a bloke here tonight

Get out my way, mister

No, I won't read your lips right now
And baby, hey
You send a shiver down my spine
But do you read my mind
Do you?
He's probably got stopped by a panda
For speeding on his way there
Flashing of digital cameras
From tourists in Trafalgar Square

The cigarette smoke in your eyes
Watching a stripper and
(Snortin' some coke yeah)
Snortin' some coke off her thighs
