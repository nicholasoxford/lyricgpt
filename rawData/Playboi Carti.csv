They wait patiently, patiently, patiently, patiently
I had to damn near sell my soul for this information
The Illuminati owns part of me
What I also found out, Kanye West is the executive producer
Along with Matthew Williams who work at Givenchy
So maybe that will make sense, some of the pictures he been posting recently
That's reason why he said he got a gift for y'all
Nigga, he's Santa
That's the gift, nigga
Okay? This year been horrible
And to be honest, from what I'm hearing
Expect a classic (Yeah)

Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home

[Verse 1]
She a loyal bitch, you gotta pay for those
She a spoiled lil' bitch, I bought her all her clothes
You know I treat you good, I don't wanna meet your hoes
I took you out the hood, I took you to my shows
We took a lot of pics and now we look like goals
We tried some new things, we fucked a couple hoes
You changin' mood swings, you got me, I don't know
We gettin' back in, walked through the back door
You had some surgeries, but it's still fat, though
You like the cash, girl, you helped the cash grow
You drive a Lambo' with some leg room
Girl, I'm waitin' on you, bring that bag home, ooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it
Bring that money home
[Verse 2]
She don't play with bitches, she don't play with hoes
Yeah, she with the shits, she might kill a ho, yeah
If it's 'bout Yung Carti, yeah, my bitch on go
When she on that molly, anything goes
She was in Miami on a fuckin' boat
With some ball players, she left them niggas broke
She just text my phone, told me, ""I'm alone""
I respond back, ""When you comin' home?""
She respond back, ""I was in my zone""
The money counter on, the money counter on
Uh, hold up, what you talkin' 'bout? Come here
Girl, I'm waitin' on you, bring that bag home, ooh

[Chorus]
Yeah, bring that money home, daddy waitin' for it

Everybody rock with me because I'm up now
Took your girl and I'ma score like I made the touchdown
Swervin' in that Lambo', doors go up, not on a bus now
Used to want a G-Shock, now I'm walking with a bustdown
Pull up and I'm flooded with a iced-out watch
Whip, it look like butter, baby, pecan drop
Pecan drop, put that four in Sun Drop
Stack my knots, count a lot, saw a lot
Got them rocks, diamond rocks, whip the pot
Suicide, 1600, that's the block
Hit your girl, that's check-free
She ain't used to text me
Now she wanna caress me
She keep tryna neck me
I gotta tell my bestie
Someone call my bestie
Think I found my bestie
Link up, make a check bleed
