Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back

Don't look in the mirror
At the face you don't recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied

[Verse 2]
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

[Chorus]
I don't know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Don't know why I
Feel so skinned alive
[Verse 3]
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasn't my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis

Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in

Even when you're talking war games

You never go out and you never stay

All over the planet's dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the

From all that you want to be
Just got paid and now you're going
Round inside your place

And I'll miss your glow as I unsettle
Oh, and I'll always feel
I will always be-
