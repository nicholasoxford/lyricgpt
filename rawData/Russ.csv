She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Verse 1]
She's falling but she doesn't think he'll catch her
'Cause her last relationship was a disaster
Accusations everyday, she didn't know why
All her calls would be ignored, he's on his own time
Should've ended it before it started
All she ever got was broken hearted
He was cheating on her, trying to flip it
Back on her like a victim
Now she all alone and starting over
Now she got baggage on her shoulder
But the new guy really loves her
She loves him, but she doesn't trust herself anymore

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
[Verse 2]
Despite her past, she can't help the attraction
He tells her that he's nothing like the last one
He redefines in every way what love is
She fell for him and hasn't gotten up since
Every now and then, she goes off, though
Beating on his chest like a bongo
He understands she's coming from a hurt place
Answers all the questions on her survey
Doesn't get jealous, doesn't break trust
Doesn't call her, ""Ho"" after hang-ups
Give her everything she ever wanted
And even though she still feels haunted

[Chorus]
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh
She's falling in love now, losing control now
Fighting the truth, trying to hide
But I think it's alright, girl
Yeah, I think it's alright, girl, ooh

[Intro]
Yeah (Ooh)
Yeah (Oh)
They let us in the rap game (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I swear they let me in this motherfucking rap game (Mmm, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Got a chick, I call her Lola, she feel like the ocean
Like to drink and smoke some doja and I feel like smoking
Plus she good at charming cobras, I feel like I'm chosen
But she ain't the only one, no
Got a chick, I call her Katia, she be acting boujee
Then she came through and topped me off, now she just a groupie
Got the aura of the Mafia, her friends wish they knew me
But they ain't the only ones, no, no

[Chorus]
What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Verse 2]
I been at this shit for nine years, now they start to call
I'm a DIY pioneer, they trying to get involved
Yippee ki-yay, ahh yeah, 'bout to set it off
I'm probably the only one, yeah
Come correct when you approach me, I can size you up
Taking all the shots like Kobe, almost 81
Guess I got to play the goalie and go and save me some
I'm probably the only one, yeah

What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want

Y'all ain't fooling me at all, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 3]
Who wants my money? I'll tell you who I don't fuck with
Who's pulling strings? I'm just pointing out all the puppets
What I'm demanding is fucking up all the budgets
I'm smart as fuck, they be talking like I'm the dumbest
But I know what they want from me, dollars, lot of stock in me
It ain't nothing personal, it's business and I'm a commodity
But honestly, Pop Pop would be turning in his grave
The day I let someone else become the boss of me
When there's a boss of me, I'll be damned

[Chorus]
What they want, what they want, what they want
Dollar signs, yeah, I know it's what they want
What they want, what they want, what they want
Y'all ain't fooling me at all

Goodbye, no use leading with our chins
This is where our story ends
Never lovers, ever friends
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day
But before you walk away
I sincerely want to say
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
Bitch, you're a black hole, sucking me in your vacuum
Yeah, I cracked my windshield, lucky that I didn't crack you
And I'm feeling drunk in this hotel room trying to ask you
'Bout all of your past dudes and why they stay so present
'Cause bitch if I'm the future, then why they in yo' presence?
And if I'm the king and you the queen
Then why you acting like a peasant?
(Why you acting like a peasant?)
I thought that you were gonna tell all of your exes
Goodbye, bye
(Fucked it all up! Stupid!)
Goodbye!
[Verse 2]
Let me start with Paul, have fun on your farm!
While you counting your chickens
And your goats while you getting dogged
'Cause you think you love Paola
'Cause you went and fucked Paola
But you're just enamored by pussy power
'Cause you never really got it
So when she threw it, yeah, you caught it
And I knew it but I bought it and Paul's just your puppy
Better keep him on your leash
'Cause the second that he finally gets some more pussy he's gon' leave
But round of applause for all the losers like Paul!
(That's just one bum you should've told)
Goodbye, bye
Goodbye!
Goodbye!

[Verse 3]
Yeah, let me name these hoes!
There was Blake, there was Devon, there was Igor, there was Paul
Then I found out you're a prostitute
So there's more names than I recall!
Should've listened to the cops! Should've listened to my pops!
Should've listened to Bugus, man, why did I not?
Because I, I really loved you
Oh, I, I really loved you
But you're a money hungry ho
Guess what I'm saying
[Chorus]
You told me that I was crazy
'Til I pulled up on your man and you
You looked like the devil when you waved at me
Bitch, I got something to say to you
Goodbye (Know you fucked this up!), bye
(And I'ma call you from the Grammies, too!)
Goodbye! (Hopefully you pick up, so I can tell you again)

I wanna be clear, I'm stayin' right here
Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby

[Verse 1]
Your heart weighs a ton
Girl watch me heavy lift
How many more times we gon' argue over petty shit
I mess up but shit you mess up too
The way you answer makes me question you
I guess your body ain't the only thing that's flexible
You bend the truth, we lettin' loose, verbal warfare
Open wounds we still poke even tho we know it's sore there
Cause hurt people hurt people, that's a known fact
You got me tempted to say fuck it where my hoes at
But I know that they don't last, that's why I don't go back
I stay put I want you, I don't care I want you

Cause ain't nobody takin' my baby
[Verse 2]
It was me and you in love for a quick summer
Now we textin' question marks cause we switched numbers
Lookin' back you were the perfect fit
Didn't let me fuck right away you made me work for it
Use to ride around drunk you brought out the worst in me
Damn I went to jail with you and that was a first for me
Heaven knows that I was hell bent
First time we said we love each other was through cell vents
Guess I should've known then
But I'm stubborn I'll admit that
At least I got some classic rap songs from your mishaps
Shit I ain't perfect though, I stayed what's wrong with me
I'm in love with challenges, girl that's just honesty
No matter what tho I stayed put
Till it wasn't funny anymore like Dane Cook
Out of sync out of touch, I should probably give it up but
I'm a lover not a fighter but I'll fight for what I love

Yeah, why you believin' the propaganda?
Why everybody sound like they wanna be from Atlanta?
Are you the voice or the echo?
Are you the nail or the hammer?
I be talkin' while chewin' my beats, I don't mind my manners
Choruses that fit the opera, that's why I need phantoms
I got my doubt at gun point, that's why I need ransoms
And I be handsome, that's why I got your girl before the money
Honestly, I thought I'd have 30m's before my twenties
But I'm cool with how it's happenin'
Girl in San Fran. who wants to cross routes with me
Like a young Colin Kaepernick
Treat the money like a lateral, I'm passin' it
'Cause my family's number one, never put 'em number two
Tryna buy a house in cash for all the times we had to move
All the times my mom cried 'cause she ain't know what else to do
All the times she lost hope 'cause she ain't know what else to lose
All the times I shoot shots 'cause I don't know what else to shoot, man

I'ma stay winnin', I don't believe in luck
I believe that life's a buffet, better eat it up
I've seen enough to know that I'm really 'bout to blow
Never felt like an employee, always felt like CEO
Even when I stacked shoes, I was never clocked in
Yeah, I always walked out, but I never walked in
That's a tribute to my head-space
And lately my Devils have been Spanish chicks in red lace
Doing Brujeria on me for ten days
More like ten months, but I got out of it
If I fall in love again, it's probably with a Saudi chick
But I keep my head up high and my middle fingers higher, yo

Way before I ever had a groupie (uh)
Back when I used to wear the same five shirts
Way before I ever had Gucci (uh)
Way before I ever had a Rollie on
Talking back when I dropped Corleone
Picking up an eighth that my homie got
Fuckin' in the car, that's the only spot
Back when I felt more free, back when I smoked more weed
Back when I drove up and down 92, with a view of the moon and you in my passenger seat
That was so good, now it's all gone
It is what it is 'cause we both moved on
At least we, have memories, and we also got this song (yeah)

Yeah, if you saw me now
Would you recognize me or would you call me out?
I know it's been a while but I'm still me
But honestly it's been so long that I wouldn't be offended if you didn't even feel me
There's a gap now, big enough to make us forget how we felt in the past now
Everything moves so fast now, damn
I miss things going slower, I miss us being closer
I mean I got a good thing but I feel like I don't even really know her
This a new life, I didn't do you right
But I got a second chance to improve my appreciation, I should take it
I'm sorry that I ever got jaded, for real

This ain't overnight, this is year ten visions
Peers listen and they know that I'm up next
That's your girl? Why she do whatever Russ says?
Success is somethin' that I'm blessed with mentally (yeah)
I got plaques for my raps and my melodies
Can't forget about the beats too, I'm the best kept secret
Real shit or fake shit, pledge your allegiance
I was off for so long, now I'm on though
Bitch, I'm talkin', don't you interrupt this god flow
Thank you to anyone who ever slammed the door on me
Because of you, I did it myself, so it means more to me
Did so many free shows and now they can't afford the fee
No one gave a fuck and now the whole world's recordin' me, yeah
[Chorus]
Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a different crew every weekend
You, don't want it that bad, keep sleeping

[Verse 2]
Lately, I been tryna minimize all my stresses
Seven figures when they tax me, that's a blessin'
Diss me, I'ma diss you back on a hit song
PDs love me worldwide, you'll get shit on
Get it on your own or I can't respect it
See me in person, don't call, don't text it
Show a lot of love to my people, I don't post it
Y'all don't gotta know, just as long as they know it (yeah)
Despite your efforts, I'm here and I always will be
No rap name to hide behind, this the real me
Before the plaques, I was certified
I do business, I keep my income diversified
I counted 35 thousand with my family last night
And another 35 before this verse
I be layin' wide awake up in my thoughts at night like
""Goddamn, motherfucker, this worked""
[Chorus]
Me, got it out the mud, they respect that
Me, always spread the love when I get back
You, got your hand out, that's a bitch move
You, always complaining like a bitch do
Me, still right here with who I came with
Me, self-made, my circles on the same shit
You, got a new crew every weekend
You, don't want it that bad, keep sleeping24Embed"

Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her, she's a freak
I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace

Meaning I switch shifts

Looking back ashamed we were only a phase

Teaching you the language of the universe Rosetta who?
Put you on a pedestal
All eyes on me but you loved me when I had seven views
You lookin' like I should go half on a baby with you
And if I'm wrong, I won't debate it with you
I'll own up to it, you voluptuous
They not down for the curves but I'm up to it
Come gimme all that
You the only girl I'll call back

Come and go as you please

Because your parents separated
You thought money sewed seams
Now you think it's your fault
You enabled the breakup
But that’s the power of money
Now you just funding the makeup
With the same tool that brought it down
Tell the waiter I don't want no ice
I just want tequila
I don't want it watered down
Everything I bought for y'all
I figured that I bought a crown
I figured that y'all know that you can get it since I got it now

Guess I look the part, so I might as well
Heaven's where you get when you fight through Hell

Because if I do, y'all call me crazy, sayin' my focus is wrong

But you're the one that I love
Damn, that I love (I'm sorry, I love you)

I don't know why we even tried this in the first place
But it all comes back to love

Tryna' argue my point
We in room 420
And you rolling up joints
Still at the dirty hotel
You still call it to trap
And you climbed on top
I still got you back to back
In the back of my Nissan
Fuck that dude who ran up tryna' be on you
Got you in my car with my beats on move
To the back seat, let me change your mood
Too many questions, what, where, when, who

Y'all gon have to do better
I can't believe what I'm seeing
All this bullshit going on
The industry is deceiving
All the masses
Pitching rappers as these independent grinds
Meanwhile there's been a label right behind them the whole time
Fake shit call it out
You were plugged before your first song
I was puttin in work
You were getting worked on
Yo fans are fickle
Cuz your come up is a mystery
My fans gon stick with me
Cuz me and them got history
Longer than 2 songs
You don't know how to build
You tried to start at the roof ah
You won't be here for too long
I don't fuck with crews unless you're the one who put the crew on
The rest of y'all got buzz because he put you on a few songs
Ooo umm did that strike a nerve
If the shoe fits then wear it
Either way I know the truth imma share it
See these rappers sign deals
Labels know what they're doing
They tell the rapper don't announce it
So the people keep rooting

And that boss rapes you
Barely pays you
But you cool with it
You're a soldier unaware that you're a lieutenant
I gotta gripe with the media
All of y'all are wanna be's
Producers and rappers
Down for sodomy
Dick taking
Cuz the industry tells you to
It's fucked up I had a standard that I held you to
I'll name names if you provoke me
So shut your fucking mouth
My platform is way bigger
Than the ones that turned me down
Bunch of grown men and women
Talkin bout grown men and women for a livin
Man you gotta be kidding
Call me bitter
Call me jealous
Call me this
Call me that

You're an industry artist
I'm an artist in the industry
Me myself and I that's the holy fucking trinity
I partnered with Columbia
Partnered is the key word
We split the profits 50/50
Better do your research
Came in with my own fanbase
Sold out tours around the world before the handshakes
You see I play the game well
You let the game play you
You don't know your own power
You think the label saved you
Now subconsciously you owe them
You're submissive with your actions
Then you flop flop flop
And you wonder what happened
Couple things
You dropped one song and signed a deal
You have less than 10 songs out
You're not real
So the song became bigger than the artist
People know the song but they don't know the artist
Not enough songs to become their favorite artist
Not enough songs to be a headline artist
I could do a week long set if I performed my whole catalogue
Every single song the crowds sing and rap along
Fuck a summer I'm a decade rapper
You're here now I'll be here a decade after
I put out 11 albums
Produced by Russ
Mixed mastered engineered written by Russ

I'm here

[Verse]
Yeah, the cash came, I ain't trippin' on a past flame
Even if they were dimes, you know how many 10's want my last name?
Is this the rap game or high school politics?
Bars could be on Maury 'cause they got a little pop in it'
Before I show up, that's when the deposit hits
You only want me now, that's what I have problems with
Five-star suites, Trojan wrappers on the floor
That's the aesthetic when you gettin' half a mil' on tour
Not bad for six weeks, plus I should receive my plaque soon
Shittin' on the game, I'll probably hang it in my bathroom
Last June I was broke, this June I made a hundred
Before and after, didn't change me though I stayed a hundred
Show me someone else who's doin' what I'm doin'
Singin', rappin', mixin' masterin', engineerin' producin'
That's every song with no exception, plus the catalog longer than a lot of veterans
Mention me amongst myself 'cause I'm the first of my kind
You live a Semi-Charmed Life, 'cause your third eye is blind
I'm a shepherd, not a sheep, but I heard it's my time
Was in the shadows for so long, I deserve all my shine
Got some women you would love to fuck, left on read
Got some homies 'bout that arm leg, leg, arm, head
I should call it a night, too many women can be dangerous
You let 'em behind the scenes, all of a sudden they start framin' us
I make enough to alter her perception of me
The older you get, the more expensive lessons will be
Gotta tighten up, move a little bit more militant
Comin' down your block, lookin' like we copped the whole dealership
Penthouse suites, but couldn't tell you what city
Same ones who stayed down with me gon' be up with me
See that's the code you uphold when you know what it took to really grow into the star you all know so
When Bugus touch down, I got the Bentley waiting for him
In L.A., the next time I'll probably play The Forum
But for now, catch me selling out the Novo
No debut, no openers, I'm solo
You're trapped in the club 'cause you can't sell tickets
Your album flopped and you went ahead and fell with it
But fuck y'all, I'm a business man
I'm smokin' caviar cones in my sprinter van
On the phone with my lawyer talking about eight digits, yeah
Just to be safe, even my safes got a safe in it
False accusations, think I'm done with the groupies
'Cause one bad scene can fuck up the whole movie, so
Fuck these hoes, man I'm out the game
Plus they jump around quicker than House of Pain
Break the bank for the family, take everyone to Waikiki
My homies are big and African, knock you out in dashikis
To my family, I'm Russell, to these women habibi
Ex's know they played themselves when they see me on TV
Big money offends, small minds too bad
I give my girls a new life, you give your girls a new bag
Doin' interviews with Forbes 'cause the come ups amazin'
I got a new fetish for jewelry and expensive vacations
I got the industry shook, like, ""How's he's popping like this?
How I don't know him, but he still got 60K on his wrist""
Now I can't go to the mall, 'cause I'll probably get mauled
And I lied, I wasn't busy, I'm just ignorin' your call
'Cause maybe I feel like you don't really deserve a response
'Cause you were curvin' me crazy when I was tryna get on
Now I'm fresh up in the game, and I already went gold
'Cause I gave them what they want now they losin' control
Had to do it myself, pull the trigger on my dreams
Always knew that this would happen, manifested everything
Now they gon' write about me, like they were right about me
Some people lookin' like they wanna snatch the white up out me
That's new to me, forgive me for bein' jaded to my race
But I been color blind, that wasn't just a mixtape
[Outro]
Yeah, one of eleven, yeah, I put out eleven
Produced, mixed, mastered, engineered, written by me
Yeah, this just the beginning though
Yeah, debut shit6Embed"

I need a crazy bitch that's down for me
I need a little something wild and free
I need the right amount of attitude
She checks herself but she checks me too
I need her to reciprocate all my love
Get drunk with me even if she loves blunts
Baby bring that accent out for me
I need a crazy bitch that's down for me

Cause baby I'll be down for you
I promise I'll be down for you
Even when I'm not around
Somewhere outta town
I promise I'll be down for you

I need a crazy bitch that's down for me
But not the type of crazy that don't let me breath
Baby fall back I'm executing Gods moves
That's just in my blood
That's just how a God moves
Hope you understand and you catch my wave
Hope you know you're bad as fuck but not too vain
I need someone who really loves me for me

I don't need your text what the fuck did you think I called for
Ask yourself what you really wanna be

Yeah, eating in Italy, golfing in Glasgow
Swimming in Switzerland, Mr. International
All off these rap flows (Yeah)
All off these chord progressions (Yeah)
All of these kicks, snares, melodies and tour investments (Yeah)
I put my own money up so no one tells me shit
I know what you about to say before you tell me it
You so predictable (Uh)
I'm so in tune with it (Uh)
I gotta folder with a lotta women's nudes in it (Uh)
I gotta Rolex, I gotta lotta chains
But none of that is worth as much as memories that I've gained
I'm flying PJ's, 50,000 each way
Live from the peach-state, I hit the sweepstakes
These days they all scream, ""Russ""
Some are screaming hate
Some are screaming love
Fuck it every time you judge I get paid
That's what my mom told me
I'ma cop the wheels of fortune cause you owe me
Pat Sajak shit, Pat Sajak shit
Might get a Maybach for Maybach just to say that shit
I gave a million to the government, I pay taxes
Did I say government I meant the mob, I hate that shit
Legal extortion of half my fortune
Soon as the tour ends a portion of my racks like Nordstrom gets taxed
If that's the cost of doing business dog, I need loopholes
Luckily the money getting longer than Manute Bol
Sumo, it's time to put my foot down
Picked up the gin around the time I put the kush down
I still smoke a little but not without a shot in me
Connected to my higher self, yeah, that's the God in me
I'm just tryna stay on top like an apostrophe
Bitch, I'm tryna win, fuck only being a nominee
I'm a one of one, Russ is an anomaly
Coming to your city and boosting this economy

Just live your truth and do you
They hate honesty, ""boo hoo""
Just count up all your blessings
Big or small, they're still all blessings

[Verse 2]
Three accounts each over a milli'
Rap game so crazy, if I'm sober I'm silly
Yeah I drink, yeah I smoke
But that's natural elixirs
You live like your future ain't in the picture
I'm high up out in Malibu (Out in Malibu)
The road to real wealth is always paved with different avenues
The difference in dividends
Is multiple businesses
I got end of year goals too big for Christmas lists
I'm dropping these jewels
I'm breaking the rules
I take your negativity and I use it as fuel
These rappers are food
Yeah I'm still hungry
I own apartment complexes, that's real money
[Chorus]
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I saw I conquered
No fake shit against me shall prosper
Yes I came I conquered
And they don't wanna see you win
So its fuck them till the end

Let her soak up all the sunshine
Let her watch the rain stop
All because her son shined

And you know it's going up
Plays in the millions
Guess I'm finally blowing up
Oh what a feeling
Ten years makin' beats
Patience taste bitter
But that after taste is so sweet
Could've stopped at anytime
Wouldn't have believed this
People used to talk down
But now I got 'em speechless

That's what I call manifest

Look around, everyone soundin' lazy
Am I the only one who does themselves on the daily?
I don't wanna hear about these rappers with the same flows
Everybody cut, copy, pastin', where'd the game go?
I remember when I was a kid that woulda warranted
Excommunication from the game, now they rewarding it
Got me so glad I know myself

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah, I'm a lover, I'm a fighter
I'm a brother, I'm a writer
I'm a soul equipped with the voice
Who took the choice to turn the mic up
See a lot of human beings doing life inside they mind cause
They're born into the bondage, mental slavery till it's time to
Either die or break the shackles, tell me what's the difference
I'm just tryna live as free as I can while I'm existing
In this realm, I swear it's hell until you break free
But I'mma break the boundaries
Before the boundaries ever break me, but

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling our father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
[Verse 2: Russ]
I need your ears, I need your fears to disintegrate
I see the years, I see the tears, but put love in that place
I know it seems like sometimes the sunshine forgets to do its job
Cause all you know is rain and pain
And the chains just won't come off
Cause God doesn't feel so close anymore
When your mind is so far gone
The Devil's got a hold on your soul, they've got this bond
That's so strong, I just hope I encourage you to break it
There's no wrong in trying to do right even if you don't make it

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night

Get a glimpse of my potential when I believe in myself
Yeah

Yeah

[Verse]
It's gettin' harder to tell the difference between reality and dreams
The lines keep blurrin' like I'm drivin' half asleep
I'm invitin' you to see who's next up in this rap shit
Hooks, beats and verses, every song I score a hat trick
Always said I'd never sign but lately, I been tempted
'Cause my dad just asked for gas money, my mom just said she spent it
It's easy to pass judgement when you comfortable in life
But desperation breeds a beast, the truth won't always be polite
So I'm fresh up off the flight, headed towards a life boat
Hope their word has good credit like a FICO
Only time will tell but I been feelin' like it's my time
How long you gonna keep a star player on the sidelines?
But, I'm the coach, guess God is the owner
Guess I'm just waitin' for that tap on my shoulder
Tellin' me to go in, I'ma stop the game
Blow the whistle like Snowden, young Terrell Owens
Makin' noise, still one of the greats though
I never RIP, I want MVP written on my gravestone
Your boy buzzin' in I swear this life is like a game show
One man army, when I sing, I get Tank hoes
Yeah, you know that R&B freak love
Weed so loud, Imma need you all to speak up
I hope every album that I drop has Carter III buzz
Wake up, I'm tryna live a life you couldn't dream of
I'm careful with who I include in all of this
'Cause most want a free ride but I ain't handin' out scholarships
Went to college for a semester
All it taught me was that college ain't for everyone
I'm not like everybody, so I left
My mom still supported but she was upset
'Till she saw the crowd scream my name out on Sunset
She got to watch her son light up the whole spot
Right there in that moment it's like she understood my whole plot
Different women, different offers every day now
I could see the reason why some people wanna hate now
'Cause my past 24 been more action packed than Jack Bauer
Made 100 thousand in the past hour
It's been a whirlwind, let me hit the blunt with you
Barely in the industry and I already got trust issues
Damn, or maybe past relationships, did that
I gave 'em all my trust and I ain't never get this shit back
But, fuck it, 'cause I'm on to new things
I looked up at the sky, long enough, I grew wings
Now I'm talkin' to myself like they gon' try and break you
God forbid it happens, breakdowns create break throughs
I'm sittin' on the debut, sounds like a greatest hits
Labels tryna eat, so of course they want a stake in it
And of course they talk of money, so of course I entertain this shit
Of course they lookin' at my table tryna find a place to sit
I'm patient with my process, weighin' all my options
Ya'll talkin' way too much, all these phone calls sound like auctions
Funny 'cause you used to laugh when I would say I'm ready
Now the ones who doubted me are gonna tell you how they met me
When I'm standin' where I knew I would, number 1 spot
Another year, another rapper, yeah, another one flop
Ya'll barely fuckin' the game, you on the scene for 5 minutes
Then you bust and it's over, I'm a movie, you're just a snippet
This that '89 Pistons, fuck the game up, get rings shit
Name your favorite rapper, bet I got him on my hit list
Name your dream girl, bet I end up on her wish list
Tell me how you want it, beast raps, or I could sing shit
It's time to wake up, industry full of hypnotists
I speak for myself, I don't need a ventriloquist
I need a vacation to where the real people live
You just stay on vacation, havin' real ego trips
You don't wanna admit, that without you I'd be fine
But the truth is hard to swallow when you chokin' on your pride
That goes for the girls I swooped in on
Made their brain drool, they gave top with a bib on
Always keep my switch on, watch me illuminate
Up at the studio, Drake is just a room away
Maybe I should barge in, maybe I should wait
This gon' be a funny story couple months from today

Faith lookin' slim, and my doubts gaining weight
Dad on meds, doctors say he's bipolar
I'm scared that I'ma turn out like that when I'm older
Haven't been in love since I was droppin' mixtapes
Built up a wall, swear it's tall, like 6'8
I don't wanna spend my 20s on the road
To spend my 30s wondering why I'm alone
I might buy a 40, take it straight to the head
50,000 dollars could get all my haters dead
I won't even feel it and they won't even trace it
Devil sees my blessings, swear to God he's tryna take it

Middle finger aimed at anywhere the pain's at

Yeah, it's time to pack
Luggage full of dreams with the tags still intact
But the plastic's still wrapped, I haven't opened it
With my feet up on a top floor screaming ""Jesus""
But I want more, it's all good, though
This feel like that blow a pound with my dawgs on my Suge flow
They love me in the hood, so
Shout out Macivan spreading CD's round the discount mall like a virus
Bosses choking, hope your employees know how to do the Heimlich
Left the bullshit way behind like Kirk Hinrich
I'm the first of my kind, ain't no doubt about it
Slightly schizophrenic, I'm in the studio with myself
There's still a crowd around
Think I finally found the youth, it's in the truth
Since 50 rocked the vest, I had the juices
With my feet up on a top floor screaming “Jesus”
But I want more

I won't stop until I hear the world scream my name out, name out
Who you are is what you do, not what you say

I made a promise to myself in '99
Not to shoot for the sky would've been my biggest crime
Sifted through my teens, growing now, I got a dream going
People said you sick for believing so I sneezed on 'em
Spent the rest nights focused on the lights
Aim for the stars, cock back, open flight
Then I got caught, hot fingerprints on the shotgun
List of success suspects and I'm the top one
You could see me live, getting swifted
You could call my momma, if you ask, she'd admit that
Climbing from the bottom got grit and the fools take hits
But the shooter in the pit cause she fit
So please don't pity me, you see me holding keys
I always like to tease, won't be the bitch to appease
Soon the hoes come running and the checks start coming
But I'm in it for the height, not the summit (aye)

They wanna take yours to hang they own on they Christmas tree
I just believed you cause I was raised with love
You thought I was the lick, but you ain't slick
See people change with love, try to take advantage
Cause they view it as a weakness like I'mma do whatever I want
And he won't see shit coming, but I peep bitch running
Keep it moving with your basic ass
Y'all small town hoes are all the same, I gotta plane to catch

I'm just waiting for the pick up
You call that shit a sixteen? I call that shit a pick up
Listen to your songs, sounding like you give up
Rappers sounding weak, I guess it's time for us to lift up
This whole game, cause Drakes the only one who's fucking shit up
The rest of y'all, hiding in the shadows like a ninja
But fuck your stealth, Russ is making noise
Turning up on myself like what

It’s so hard to trust again
So just like that you don’t (uh)
You 'gon just get drunk again roll up and fuckin' smoke (uh)

Yeah, I pay my dues and get paid for it, too
The outcome of my input is my favorite review
I do the work of two and half men like Charlie Sheen
This is what you get when you don't care about the party scene
So pardon me if I don't really look amused
I'm just shootin' for the masses like I'm tryna make the news
All this winning by myself, got these labels all confused
I should do a deal with a Nike 'cause these checks are comin' soon, ooh
Am I the only one lifted?
The money ain't as fun when you're the only one with it
I need a smaller table and a bigger fence
I see these leeches campin' out, it's like they live in tents
I'm too advanced for your advances, man, I'm feelin godly
Russ is the wave, nah, Russ the tsunami
Te quieres casar conmigo, yeah, they want me
This is for my Spanish girls in Brooklyn screaming, ""Papi""
Everybody's in the same game, different levels with it
Same hell, different devils with it, yeah
Lemme tell you how my life feel
This past year has felt like a high light reel
I chew my beats and I spit out anthems
If you wanna stand out gotta be outstanding
I know what I gotta do to make my mom stop crying
Trying times doesn't mean it's time to stop trying
I'm flying with wings that grew from leaps of faith
Feelin star struck every time I see my face
Oh that's crazy talk ain't it?
I'm just gassed off my drive, though
Whole album fire, I might call the shit, ""Pyro""
I could go to Saudi, make 20 racks a night
By the time this comes out, it's probably 5 times the price
5 mics use to mean something, nowadays I don't give a fuck
About your magazine it means nothing
I change the world by example, not by my words
I move around with a handful of people that know they worth
Ain't no playin us, we were born to make a dent
We understand that there's way more to life than just paying rent
But speaking of rent, I think we bout to lose the house
Think they repo-ing the cars, think we gotta sell the couch
Think they cuttin' off the lights, think they turnin' off the water
And I'm still turnin' down every single label offer
Top prospect, projected high draft pick
I'm in my own league, though
Own my own team, though
Making hooks like lay ups and verses like free throws
I beat the game and I ain't even use a cheat code
You hatin' from the stands, I'm ballin out, peep the seats, though
Too young for this wisdom, make them wanna check ID, though
I been psychic, motherfuckers doubted
I suggest you listen when I talk and shut your mouth
It's very evident I know some shit you don't

No losing, just learning

Put me on a Persian throne

But the only thing suicidal
Is the doors of my McLaren
I'm winning, you in denial
My rival is my reflection
While I pursue perfection
I'm using your negativity
Channeling my aggression
Into hits, plaques, shows, they happened
Grateful that I don't get lost in hoes and fashion
This is the bounce back soundtrack
Used to work at Outback
I found rap
What would I be without that?

Treat this game like any other bitch, I just need me the top
Always knew that I'd become what I'm becomin'
That one that's got the movers and shakers all in discussion (Blat, blat, blat)
Peep my percussion, it's no wonder why the bands about to come in
I see y'all fightin' but my fans about to jump in
I been calculatin', livin' in this house of patience
Quarantined myself down here, but now I'm breakin' out the basement
Ended up at Lyor's house, bein' great is a choice
Always workin' in silence, let my success make the noise
I'm on my wave now, welcome to my stakeout
The type of focus where I don't count the days, I make the days count
I can't take the same route, I got this mapped out differently
What I can get myself, I won't give you a cut to give to me
I'll give it to myself, put my family on my payroll
Conductor of my train, nothin' moves unless I say so (C'mon)

[Chorus]
I had to talk with my mom
She said, ""What if you're the one you've been waitin' for?""
I treat my obstacles like stepping stones
And keep climbing and climbing some more
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Yeah, no matter what, I never lose my ambition
I soldier through the bullshit, turn my wounds into wisdom
There's some new women itchin' for some love and attention
But I'm still scratchin' the surface of my potential
Won't let them fuck up my focus, I rarely ever like they advice
'Cause they gon' try and dim my light because I shine in they eyes
I'd rather be hated for what I am than loved for what I'm not
I wanna give my mom the world without worryin' 'bout the cost
I'm gonna make it crack, savin' rap, y'all should be ashamed of that
I'm not red or blue when I say that I cannot bang with that
Hooks, beats, verses, tell me, who the fuck can hang with that?
Rappers shootin' out the gate so fast but ain't maintainin' that
Yeah, my goals are more and more tangible
This buzz that I'm building's becomin' more and more flammable
'Bout to blow, oh yo, you should be up on this already
But in case you're not I'll let you catch up while I sip this Henny

And you know that this drink got me talkin, late night callin, yeah

Fell in love with a girl from PR, kept up online like PR
Had me waitin like a DR, stretch her out in her room like ER
I stumbled on your page got liquor in my thumbs I see you followin my path, my thought, and actions left crumbs

I thought that I left you in Atlanta
I thought that I'd never see you busy
I thought that without me you'd go down
I thought that you'd never leave the city

[Chorus]
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could
And you know that this drink got me talkin, late night callin, yeah

Out of state got a couple shows gettin' money
Hotel room with a ten and twenties
Scoop her, Uber, tryna manoeuvre, tryna test me but I studied
Got a little bit a hesitance, keep one eye on you like a wink
Sunset Boulevard, moonlight tint, off the sauce like ooo I slipped
I thought that I left you in Los Angeles
I thought that I'd never see you busy
I thought that without me you would go down
I thought that you'd never leave the city

[Chorus]
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could
And you know that this drink got me talkin, late night callin, yeah
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
I'm comin' back to you, back to you
And I know that I shouldn't and I wouldn't if I could

All I ever tried to do was help you understand and grow
Light the way for truths that if not for me simply wouldn't show
'Less you get somebody else who's on my level, but you know
That there's no one on my level, you gon' realize if you don't
I wish you would own up to your flaws
And just say that you're wrong when you're wrong
Instead of actin' like you're right, then it turns into a fight
Now you're stormin' out my house in the middle of the night, I'm tryna

I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three

[Verse 2: Russ]
Yeah, yeah
How come when I love somebody, part of me don't wanna stay?
Every time I get too close, I just start pushing them away
I know, I know
Maybe I just wanna leave before they try to leave me first
Maybe I don't wanna need 'em 'til they say they need me first
I know, I know (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
Drank Tequila, I can't drive home
Hard to play cool, heart belongs to
You, I know that if I show that
I keep my walls up, if you want me then you better start to climb
Women who love me aren't rare, women who mean it hard to find
Somethin' tells me that I'm right about you, please, don't prove me wrong
They say love's a song for fools who are wise enough to sing along (Yeah)

[Chorus: Ina Wroldsen]
But now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a game we do
I tell myself I'm not that into you
But I don't wanna sleep, it's quarter after three
And now it's hard to breathe
I'm not in love, it's just a thing we make
We're skin on skin, I need this spell to break, oh
But I don't wanna go, and I know that you know
You're in my head like

Are you gon' use me?
Against myself and twist my head, and now she use

You stay up with me, help me with a song or two
Your momma loves me and I think my momma loves you too (oh-ooh, oh-ooh)

I love you dearly, love it when you're near me
Love how you don't care I make weekly what they make yearly
Yes, I love your accent, I love your compassion
Plus you singing sweetly
Then on the flip side, barely sent an invite
But that's all it took, you're on a plane, I'm in your insides
Talkin' to my homies, I can't be the only
This can't be her first time

Yeah, I can't tell, do I miss you enough to drink?
Or did I drink enough to miss you? So in love, I'm scared to blink
God forbid I miss a moment with you, we sharing the bed
Taking leaps of faith of love together, we sharing the ledge
And around that time my trust issues be kickin' in
I swear Latina and trouble is just a synonym (synonym)
Despite chemistry, it's so hard to overlook how we met
Miami hotel, girl, it's hard to forget

Race against your doubt, a lot of y'all ain't runnin' fast enough
I can spot a fake before we even finish dappin' up
Clappin' when they win, but when I win, they never clap it up
Parents' marriage crumbled, so I told my mama pack it up
Eatin' 'til I'm fat enough, rise again like Lazarus
They be thinkin' what I'm sayin', tell me how you mad at Russ?
Ooh, this pussy's good as fuck, it's temptin' not to wrap it up
Bitch, I'm 'bout to block you 'cause that shit's gon' have me actin' up
Pass a blunt and laugh it up and celebrate my life
I want roses when I'm livin', not just roses when I die
This ain't somethin' I was given, had to take it, make it mine
Stay on office, keep on winnin', gotta make it, take it mine
I got many checks, I'm swimmin' in it
Henny sex be hittin' different
Heavy chest, when Nipsey didn't
Make it through, give me a minute, damn
Only thinkin' vertical
Run The Marathon from top to bottom, roll some personals
McLaren's a convertible, my Porsche's name is Percival
I studied this shit inside out but I am not reversible
Livin' way too purposeful, my values ain't coercible
You made a hit but shit you probably still not reimbursable
Money every Friday, indie catalog, I'm versatile
My throwaways are hits for you, one day I might be merciful
Shootin' for the stars, I never hesitate, I'm first to pull
Y'all be with the common folk, I'm at the private terminal

Weed burnin', never call a truce
So you never want a problem, just a legend how I move
Head rush, me and Russ comin' like we Dre and Snoop

Big bank ballin', in the paint, I'm known to shoot
Dolce & Gabbana or Versace be the mood
It's no love for haters, so far from neighbors
Six chains swingin', make it so hard on traitors
Start off in Avis, now it's the latest
Made top five in this, I'll be the greatest
Thought I was minor, my thoughts were major
Call it designer, sharp as a razor
Your shit declinin', thought it would phase us
Call it vagina, your Uber is waitin'

I ain't gon' lie, every night I got stress
I ain't gon' lie, I be thinking I'm next
That's why I got a gun to the right and a gun down the hall
And a gun to the motherfucking left
That's why I got cameras all over the place
Fame ain't as glamorous as everyone thinks
Lot of people wanna see me gone
Plus I've had a lot of strippers from Atlanta all over my place
Brought a little on myself, oh well
And the joint that I'm smoking don't help
And the letters that I'm getting from the women I'm in bed with
Knew I should have fucked them at the hotel
Instead of havin' them pull up to the house
But like I said, I don't like going out
'Cause the times that we're in
Could have a good kid try to kill me for some likes and some clout

Thoughts in my head would put most in jail
Fame and the hate really don't mix well
If I get locked up, Milan post my bail
Gotta just chill, but I know myself
Liable to do somethin' nutty, uh
I don't give a fuck that's your buddy, uh
I need to meditate where it's sunny
And just hum like Cudi
Just stop for a second, slow down 'fore it gets too late
And I fuck around and drown off the waves that I made
I be ridin' 'round my town and I don't feel safe
Let alone when I'm out, let alone out of state
Everybody strapped up, everybody stressed out
Think my nerves are contagious
I be tryna play it cool but deep down I be feelin' like YG

Yeah
So many sore losers keep tryna talk to me
Y'all need to focus on winning, stop focusing on me
Yeah

[Verse]
Thirteen thousand in Portugal, that's arena talk
You still on your Training Day, you Ethan Hawke
Rappers with your get rich quick scheme gimmicks
Instead of hating you should focus on your sixteenth minute
We are not side by side, ain't no split-screen image
I'ma be around forever like a Springsteen ticket
I'm just bathing in success, yeah I rinse clean with it
I put my best foot forward like a Nowitzki pivot
I got blitzkrieg critics
They ain't wastin' no time
But I ain't wastin' no money, so I pay 'em no mind
That's a lie, I be snappin'
That's my fault, I'm adjustin' to people spreadin' lies about me
Just hatin' and judging
For the sake of discussion, in the hopes of some clout
Shit's been stressful, I just need some pretty hoes with some mouth
Put my home in the South, 10K square feet
Name your favorite rappers now, let's play ""where's he?""
Probably chasin' a hit, probably lost in LA
Probably paying for likes, probably paying for plays
Probably owns a Corolla, but probably rents the Aventador
Business manager furious, like ""What the fuck did you spend that for?""
Fuck y'all though, I'ma keep on winnin'
I got angels all around me, y'all can keep on sinnin'
'Cause ain't no way y'all are fuckin' up my light light
I spent two million just on taxes, somethin' light light
In hindsight, I was right all along, life of a don
Writin' songs, all those hooks were a fight to get on
You gotta see it way before it happens, yes yes
I'ma be the greatest, I won't settle for next best
Got your girl in her birthday suit, that's best dressed
Plus she likes girls too like Ellen DeGeneres
First class Emirates that's how I'm flyin'
SUVs on the tarmac, that's how I'm arrivin'
Presidential treatment, ooh this life so good
White skin, they can't believe that I got friends in the hood
I know the love songs and melodies throw y'all off
Don't give a fuck about your face tats, we know y'all soft
People we know with face tats got them for a reason
You use them for the gang culture aesthetic, you reachin'
A lot of kids are poppin' xans and sippin' lean now
A lot of rappers using Instagram to teach how
A lot of kids OD'ed that you don't read 'bout
'Cause they don't follow rappers, they just follow fiends now
But I'm the bad guy for callin' it out
I come in clutch with the truth, y'all are stallin' it out
I only get in trouble when I say the truth
Which means you gettin' fed lies everyday, you fools
Do your research before you try and speak on my name
Rappers wearing CZs and leasing the chains
The beats classic, I amaze myself
I'm a boss, I'm a owner, yeah I pay myself
Fuck the capes of society, I saved myself
Even after all the millions bitch, I stayed myself
I still take my mom with me, Bugus still right here
New people think my buzz got here in a lightyear
Fuck y'all, this ain't a Toy Story
I eat Nigerian, save some moimoi for me
Yeah, lot of y'all girls I coulda hit
But I'm the type to pass the pussy to stay home and cut a hit
Never fuck a chick at her house, she got exes
I just bought a crib, I got guns, I got exits
Cameras at the entrance
Try if you want to
Bugus told me, ""God forbid they get you, I got you""
I'm an idol, people treat me like Billy
Singin' and rappin' goin' platinum, people treat me like Drizzy
Take the studio with me
Set up shop in the telly
I've watched a lot of rappers talk but then they flop like Belly
There ain't shit you can tell me, you can save that shit
Fake convos before favors, I hate that shit
Yesterday turned down a 150,000
I ain't trippin' 'bout it
I get that every week like allowance
From my independent catalog
Fuck these rec league rappers tryna battle 'Bron
Stay in your lane, this is big business
Move bitch, get back like Chris Bridges
I remember only sellin' like six tickets
Now I make the girls crazy like Sid Vicious
I coulda played it different, coulda silenced all my truths
Coulda buddied up with rappers for the sake of looking cool
But it's not in me to be fake, I can't do it
I can see through it, man this game is translucent
They twist the truth for the headline drama
Clicks create traffic, traffic creates dollars
The sheep believe it, they ain't up on game yet
Smooth rides ain't as fun to watch as trainwrecks (damn)
Controversy is currency, controversy is clout
That's why my haters keep my name in their mouth
Y'all are hopeless, this is a decade of devotion
It's hard to stop my movement when I'm already in motion
This ain't luck, this is by design
I had to work in the dark for my light to shine
A lot of people are dope, they just quit too soon
A lot of rappers go broke, 'cause they got rich too soon (damn)
My confidence plus my success is just a mirror for some
It forces them to look around and see what they haven't done
That's a line for any hater, y'all are mad at yourselves
Judging every move I make, y'all distractin' yourselves
You could do this shit too if you wanted
But you would rather sit around and bitch and make comments
Oh well, suit yourself, be miserable
I'm country-hoppin' in a jet, that's the visual
I saw this coming in my hoodie with the plaid flannel
I bet on myself, yeah I had to gamble
I feel like I'm half god, half mammal
Bitch I turned my life into the Travel Channel
I'm not home, I'm in Stockholm
With heated floors and the beds with the soft foam
It's like clockwork watching sore losers poke their heads out
Every time I big myself up, they get stressed out
I'm the best out, yeah I said it
Self-made millionaire, you know what's up with the credits
I'm the best out, yeah I said it

I'm callin' god,  leavin' voicemails
I know you're there, I need to talk before my voice fails
Before your boy bails
'Cause they be takin' all the fun away
I'm listening to ""Say Goodbye to Hollywood"" and ""Runaway""
I guess be careful what you wish for, right?
You say the truth and they come at you with pitchforks, right?
I'm in Copenhagen, overthinkin', every single moment, pacin'
Round and round the room, it's 4:00 AM, I'm at the phone just waitin'
For your call, I need a pep talk, God
It's getting harder to keep going I need a rest stop, God
I swear none of these massages get the stress off, God
Sometimes I swear I wanna get a gun and let off, God
Aim it right at my enemies, make the Devil obey me
They tryna kill me, can you blame me for the thoughts I have lately?
I know it sounds crazy, that's why I call daily
Please don't betray me, God can you save me? (pick up)

Family issues make success bittersweet
Sometimes a cold shoulder's the only way to deliver heat
That's the situation that I'm in with my dad
Me and my mom dipped quick, no one lives with my dad
Yeah it's sad but he brought it onto himself
Last time we talked, we didn't talk, we just yelled
He knows he got issues, he told me he's gettin' help
'Til then I gotta put this relationship on the shelf
Deal with what I'm dealt, welp, boohoo right?
I shouldn't care 'cause I got houses and some new coupes, right?
But money's not an adhesive that can take all the pieces
Of a broken family and put them back together, arenas
Ain't as loud as inner turmoil, get to the roots, replace any burnt soil
While the world boils over fake problems with me
I just need 60 seconds, yo God, hit me (Please record your message)

It took me 10 years to talk like this...

[Hook]
Put a billboard in my city
Yea I do it for the stunt
Riding Bentley's in your city
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might fly your girl out with me
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might go and blow like fifty
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt


[Verse 1]
I was broke a year ago I worked for this
Dropped 11 albums they all flopped but I learned from it
I don't go to church
But still I hope I reach the masses
Even though what took you years to make
I pay in monthly taxes
They use to say I brag too much
They use to say I sing too much
They use to say I rap too much
Now it's 10k just to drink too much
Now I got 10's in a hotel suite
When I show up it's the first time we meet
Now the highlight of your week
Is an Instagram video in the club
With a bunch of broke people peep
[Hook]
Put a billboard in my city
Yea I do it for the stunt
Riding Bentley's in your city
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might fly your girl out with me
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might go and blow like fifty
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
Yea I do it for the stunt
I just do it for the stunt

[Verse 2]
Too busy eating my own fruit to check if yours is sweeter
Too busy watering my grass to check if yours is greener
I need a celebration
Celebrating hella patience
I was down but now I'm up
I'm celebrating elevation
Up
Ex's hate but I know its love
Everyone late on the train but us
Still in a Nissan
Still with my day ones
Still keep it real as fuck
Plus
I boss up yeah it's been like that
Went on tour then I went right back
Millionaire new default setting
I keep on betting on me
[Hook]
Put a billboard in my city
Yea I do it for the stunt
Riding Bentley's in your city
Yea I do it for the stunt
I might fly your girl out with me

I was always right and you know now
You was always wrong and you know now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this, yeah
I was tryna help you out
But, I got no time to help you now
Look at where my life just went

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I need B's that's why you see me getting a buzz
My ex comin' after me like ""Mexican"" does
If Heaven's above and Hell is below
Where am I livin'?
Table full of legends, I see
Where am I sittin'?
I'm out your life, but I'm still in your search bar
Still humble, still riding in my first car
Took me 10 years to get here, I work hard
From a basement
Now I'm an all around the world star
Supported my dreams till my dreams supported me
I'm lookin' at views that you don't see 'til 43
I'm half they age but twice as paid, this the good life
A bad chick doesn't always mean a good night
Heavy bars with light hooks so it seems pop
Lately they only want my responses for the screenshots
Upgraded to a Rollie from a G-Shock
The Alchemist, Napoleon Hill mixed with Deepak
[Chorus]
I was always right and you know now
You was always wrong and you know now
Look at where my life just went
Look where you still is
I know you feel this, yeah
I was tryna help you out
But, I got no time to help you now

Cause I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
You know that I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Yeah I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Look where you still is
I know you feel this

[Verse 2]
Looking at the type of views a camera can't capture
The girls coming quick but the money coming faster
Red carpet treatment for yourself and whoever you with
Any girl you want the answers yes whoever you pick
Cause you poppin' now
You're a come up
My homies look like security so think before you run up
I'm one of few who did it their way
Taking over airwaves
5 course meals and lay flats on my airplanes
Your dream girl sending I miss you texts
I fly her out cause I miss that ""I miss you"" sex
Then I fly her back home
She a Florida State Seminole
Cause I got bands lined up like a festival
All over the world and I brought my mom with me
Just to say thank you and make her happy I spend 50 (thousand)
Ex's best friends now I don't give a fuck
I don't gotta get revenge
My life does that enough

Leaving is an option
Debt's at the door, yeah
And it keeps on knocking
IRS is watching

Got a couple plaques, I just showed up
Give me some time, no rush

I did this myself, I'm my own co-sign
Dropped so many singles, I ain't ever take a word break
You ain't hit a triple, lot of rappers born on third base
I just got plaques for my family and my friends too
Just to let them know success is possible for them too

Now you can hear the gold just jangling
But, its still about the take over

It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that, yeah

[Verse 1]
Where do I start damn, man my mind is racing
Hip hop awards getting chosen by some racists
I'm in the yo, with a bottle of some clear shit
You don't know the truth, you just hear shit
Homie's on a Learjet, upgrade from the block
If you too big, fuck fades they gon' use the Glock (use the Glock)
I do a lot for everyone around me, y'all don't see it
I'm in the club for half an hour then I'm probably leaving
I got paid, dip off with the gang
Got Bugus in the Bentley, got Herb in the Wraith
Got Tim in the Ghost, got a gun on his waist
Life or death, ain't no time to start reaching for the safe
So I play it safe
Real ones that would really go hit for me
Low overhead, no-one ever wrote a hit for me
I be making history, bigger when I'm dead
I'm so on (on)
But it's off with they head
Fuck MTV, y'all really snubbed me
How you choosing people with numbers that ain't above me?
Oh wait, politics
Playing at these colleges, getting paid more to perform than any scholarship
I'm lit, I'm gassed, I'm me, I'm me
Two platinum singles, two years they were free
As I'm writing this, I know that this ain't accurate no more
By the time that all y'all hear this I will most likely have more
I really did eight tours, headlined them all
Your contacts were bullshit, we redlined them all
I spent time in awe, on some amazed shit
Then an O.G. told me to embrace this
I will never waste this, never get complacent
Lotta these rappers got rich and got jaded
I'm still on the same shit, take over the game shit
I just can't relate to your wavelength
[Chorus]
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that, yeah

[Verse 2]
I get everything for free, from your girl to my wardrobe
Half a million dollars smiling on my torso
I buy property, you just got foreclosed
Money running low, you gon' have to do more shows
But you know no one shows for your shows
So you do club hostings but you drink what you gross
Then you go back home, fall asleep frustrated
Girl laying next to you, whispering ""Russ made it""
You asleep, you don't hear her so she sneaks out
And she pulls up on me and brings the freak out
I send her back before your eyes open
I'm her fix 'cause your life's broken
She might try chokin'
On something you don't wanna kiss after
Lifestyle of a young handsome rich rapper
It's all laughter, it's all big bucks though
Call the buzz ""Vegas"" 'cause it stays on a bus though
Girls gone wild, rich like Rothschild
I'ma make you sign an NDA, now you're on file
I'm the President, the CEO
People that I've never seen, tryna see me go (uh)
Billionaire minds in my circle that's a fact
Faded off Clooney liquor we don't know, how to act
If it's based off of fans, y'all should really do the math
If it's based off of sales, y'all should really count the plaques
If it's based off of pussy, y'all should really count the ass
If it's based off of money, y'all should really count the cash (uh)
Move around with duffle bags like Floyd does
Sometimes nothing makes more noise than poise does
Coin us the best movement of all time
Dreams too big to think small time
I'm just on the same shit, take over the game shit
I just can't relate to any B-level wave length
[Chorus]
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game
I'm on that
Yeah I'll always be on that
It's like everything changed
But I still feel the same
I'm just tryna run the motherfucking game

'Cause the catalog is long, I got more songs than Robert Plant
If you diss and you get hit, that's just a part of who I am
I'm Italian, I can't help it, we love talkin' with our hands
Had to conjure up a plan, launch a monster from a man
Your favorite singer at my crib, it's big, it's Ariana Grand'
Sayin' ""Sorry"" in advance, I got Paul McCartney fans
Rockin' Marni, this ain't Barneys, I'm a star, the Hardees man
Army van instead of lookin' for a Bentley to cop
'Cause as of late, being a rapper is the deadliest job
Why you think I got like six guns around the crib? Just pick one
5'6"", but with a stick, I swear like I feel like 6'1""
But let me chill, death is not a joke, this ain't Wendy Will'
'Cause this Henny still got mе wired like Henry Hill
Vеry ill, my entrepreneurial phase is long
I out-rap your favorite rapper then drop your girl's favorite song
Who fuckin' with me? I feel like Shaq on the Magic
I studied the dream, ooh, you got lucky, Hakeem
Plaques in countries I ain't seen, I am a money machine
Your girl like Gumby how she bends over, fuck me, it seems
That I've struck a nerve, I'm a boss, there's no one I'm employed by
That's why every show I do looks like a fuckin' Floyd fight
You're annoyed by my confidence, how beta of you
You didn't feed your wolves, so now they 'bout to take you for food
Shit, lot of people love to talk, from the stands, I ain't hearin' it
My J's ain't dirty, this is sand from the pyramids
Dave Mirra shit, with the bars, I'm a legend
Jennifer wouldn't fuck me, had to garner attention, yeah
Am I ungrateful or ambitious? Or maybe I'm both
I'm cuttin' off my crazy bitches or maybe I won't
It's inspirin', but tirin' too
I'm 'bout to fly her in, but I would never buy her a coupe
I don't reply to her nudes, off the wine I get rude
Hired McLaren, but then I had to fire the roof
All this truth that I give like Paul Pierce buckets
God talks to me, I'm Will Smith, I'm all ears running
I love it, devised a plan and then I worked the strategy
Took a lot of swings to hit, this ain't the first at bat for me
Heard you mad at me, I irk you casually, what hurts you actually
Is I'm a fuckin' boss, I gave my circle salaries
This is Nipsey mixed with Kobe, yeah, I merged mentalities
Y'all got herd anatomy, I got merch in factories
Shippin' out global, multi-million dollar mogul
Lately, I been bumpin' Roddy Ricch and feelin' antisocial, I been vocal (Uh)
Givin' gems, but I'm a Libra, so I'm givin' opals
My circle gettin' tighter now, I swear this shit's a oval
My mind is mobile, it's omnipresent
I wrote a book of my beliefs that people follow, gotta call me legend
Fuck all these peasants that be hatin' on me
Shit, ask the last guy what happened when you playin' with me
One more time, fuck all these peasants that be hatin' on me
Ask the last guy what happened when you playin' with me, c'mon

Know your roots and who you rootin' for (Word)

Hope you don't mind that I do
Not like I needed approval from you or somethin' (Nah)
I took a spoonful of the puddin'
The proof was put in, the truth is digustin' (Yuck)
Your views amuse my vision, your outlook funny
I had to enrich my sense without no money
But now we get into it, it's more than music to flow with me
I'm gonna need to see a quote from my quotes, that's poetry (Yeah)
They know me globally, from the omens I've spoken openly
Not 'cause I pose to be what they told me I'm 'posed to be
Hopefully niggas get the memo and don't take it out of context (Uh)
We ain't on the same page, check my table of contents
Stop it, I'm well read like the Nickerson Gardens
Straight out of Carson, play your cards or get discarded
I ain't the type of artist to be disregarded
This what art is, simple as that, shut up and rap
Where the lyricists at? (*Cricket chirp*) How sad
Your clique ain't on top of the game, that's just a mousepad (Uh)
They want the old Soul, I can't deny my ascension
They want the branzino, but they ain't tryna go fishin'
I took the scenic route, made wrong turns, I let y'all have y'all turn
But I thought long-term so I can teach 'em how
Virtuous patience is, I believe that (Yeah)
Remember that you can't just win, they gon' want a rematch (Uh)
A lot of people that you connect with need to be detached
The fame may go to your head, most of it be cap (Facts)
Mind over matter, respect the telekinetics
I move a mountain 'bout a mile 'cause I said it
The rapper's rapper, Black Lip Pastor, the prophet, the God
Playin' fetch with blank checks at the top with my dawgs
Who want what? (Huh) Nobody, I'm 'bout to go potty
That shit, I'm kickin' it, but I don't know no karate
No need for cold feet, I ain't playin' no hockey
'Specially when effortlessly the flow is Mojave (Yeah)
Underground emperor, my ring need kisses
Every move is calculated like we teach physics
Eat a rapper, have 'em cease existence
Then catch a attitude, 'cause now I gotta clean these dishes, Soul
[Chorus: Russ]
Who wants what? Where, when, why, say it (Why, say it)
Who wants what? Who wants what? (Who wants what?)

Against all odds and despite the hate
We keep going, always finding a way
They stay behind like a license plate (mm, yeah)
Got your back, you got my back
You won't let me get off track
If I'm down, you pick up the slack (mm, yeah)
Took a solid stance, we're both in a trance
Saw my plan, seen you in the stands

Gettin' so much money I forgot I spent like 20 bands today
Flip tricks, but I don't play X Games
I been traveling, currency exchange
A year rent, that's what the set pays
Fantasy girls get turned into sex slaves
That's a light flex, cash when i speak that's a mic check
You sitting down, I suggest that you stand up
In Russ they trust, whole world got they hands up, look

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I've been withholdin', I really feel like explodin'
People pokin', provokin', I'm suffocating, I'm chokin'
The feeling that no one gets it, I just try to suppress it
I really need to express it, I really should reinvest it
And go off, off, off on you bitches
I wonder why these fuckin' grown men always talkin' like bitches
Y'all so obsessed with me, I've never even talked to you bitches
I'd run you over with my Lambo, wouldn't stop for you bitches
I'm at my breaking point, I can wave and point
And they'll start breaking joints so loudly, exclamation point
Rappers takin' bribes, they be shavin' points
I see the game from every angle, I be playin' point
I be playin' coach, I be playin' owner
I be playin' fan, and I play promoter
Gettin' great exposure from all the hate, y'all are hustling backwards

That's ten thousand, watch your mouth when you speak 'bout your superiors
Premeditated murder, I'm plottin' with my Nigerians (Yes, oh!)
Peekin' through you, chiefin' and eating fufu
We see what this dreamin' grew to, arenas in Honolulu
Doin' streams like I'm Hulu, Lambo talks via Bluetooth
People tryna do voodoo, this zoo is making me coo-coo
And fuck the media and the politics in this industry
The snakes and the lies and the gossip in this industry
And fuck these WWE-ass rappers
High school mentality, glee-ass rappers
Fake family ties, y'all say brother too much
Y'all get played by the same women, y'all say you love her too much
And y'all be runnin' from the truth, y'all take cover too much

Yeah
Rappers dissin' for attention that their music ain't gettin'
I understand, it's frustratin' watching my rapid ascension
Watching arenas sell out, watching my plaques multiply
When you ain't headlined a tour, and when you drop they don't buy
But you got followers though, but what they followin' for
But that's 'cause most of them are fake, let me let your followers know
That y'all be payin' social media agencies twenty thou' every month
Just to comment, like, and follow your account
It's all a front, y'all are glorified Instagram entertainers
Got millions of followers, but can't even sell out your basement
Y'all droppin' antics and skits 'cause you can't drop a hit
Flashin' jewelry, posting lean, poppin' Xanax for clicks
Infatuated with designer, costume shop carollers
Bunch of crackheads and clowns, bunch of Boondocks characters
Damn, y'all not scarin' us with your Internet loose lips
I been at the same festivals y'all don't do shit

Yeah, my parents' marriage in shambles, I won't lie, it hurts
I thought money would fix it, but it just made it get worse
See my dad was the man, 'til his job cut ties
He went broke, I got rich, that shit fucked with his pride
Yeah, I recognize it was disturbing to see
The family stopped turnin' to him and started turnin' to me
Going through it, I know he tried to hide the pain
If he gave up and got a job, his dad died in vain
'Cause his dad ran a business
So my dad tried to run one too but there's a difference
No income, my dad started loosin' his confidence
Meanwhile everyday I got brand new accomplishments
At the height of my career was his lowest
And that's a lie, 'cause we both still goin'
Me up, him down, it caused a lot of angst
Argument got out of hand, had to call Frank
All my efforts ignored, he threw it all in my face
There's not a song long enough where I can say what I gave
Shit's crazy, mom couldn't believe him
I mean she's cried in the past, you know, threatened to leave him
But she never had the money to, but I got it now
It's bittersweet that this is how I bought my mom a house
Oh well, guess I should have seen it comin'
All the tears, all the threats, all the fightin' and fussin'
Hardly any lovin', way too much hate
Finally tried to change, mom said it's too late
Move out day came and went, still in shock, shit
Doesn't even know where my mom's new spot is
Wasn't the first time but this was the worst time
Hurt by your own family is the worst kind
All this shit been happenin' while I was blowin' up
And it's still going on, now you know what's up

Yeah, it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't give up
Know it rains sometimes even when it shines
Don't give up, don't

Yeah, I got way too much stress for any more bad press
Especially another lie that they make up and stretch
Damn, I can't lie, shit is takin' a toll
So much hate sent to me, some stays in my soul
To the point that when I walk into the booth, that's what I let out
Makes for good songs but mentally I'm tryna get out
Tryna focus on the good, not the evil
Can't complain, is how I always greet people
I'm exhausted, exasperated from the pain that I'm facin' and masquerading
Don't get it twisted, I'm grateful for everything
But the devil's still asking for a wedding ring
I decline, try to focus on love
Try to focus on fans, try to focus on Russ
Everyday another lie, sometimes it feels like a curse
Sometimes it feels like necessary preparation for first

Try falling back but I can't, I keep leaning towards you

So much fake shit ever since I made it
I won't ever be quiet cause I'm famous
Y'all gon' hate this (yeah, yeah)

This ain't no average Joe shit, this is everyday Russell
Joe got a day job, that's an everyday struggle
This for all the slow rappers who subliminally diss
You can at it, you can text it but you'd rather be bitch
But it's hard to hear the hate over these waves crashing
I think your time is up, I think your waves crashing
All that fade catching you promoting shit is all talk
The difference is my life is still lit when I log off, pussy go head

I don't be buying shit, it's not in my interest
You be window shopping, I be buying it

Just keep in mind what position you in
If you lucky I might make a song and diss you again
And when I say you, I meant you too
They call me Bono

Rappers feeling jumpy
Then bounce pussy, pogo
This gon' get a billion streams
This for the rappers who need promo
This for rappers who need other rappers hooks to go bronze
This for rappers who need other rappers shows to go on
(Go off)
These for rappers who still suck still
Six years later you still stuck still
Still on the uphill
There's some rappers who won't be here by the next June
There's some rappers who still asking for some leg room
I just give em half a bar like they give themselves
I kick back and watch these losers go and kill themselves

It's betrayal 'cause I trusted you, won't happen' again (Nah)

One is breaking a code, one is actin' in character
I won't do you how you did me, I won't laugh and embarrass ya
I was raised better (Definitely)
You just evil, I'm the shit before the eighth letter (G)
You showed yourself at last, like the late Etta James, I'm awake gettin' brain
But my mind's on how were you fake to my face?
Light a J, grab a bottle, pour it up, drink it straight
I can't wait to never hear from you, I was really here for you (Yeah)
You were never here for me (Facts), you were clearly here for you
I promise this ain't magic when you see me disappear from you
I just watched Hustle & Flow, but this ain't a trick (Whoop that trick)
You tried to take everything away from me, I take offense (Yeah)
What's trust? Now I gotta start from scratch
Wish you stabbed me in the heart, not the back (For real)

[Verse 2: Benny The Butcher]
They say it'll make me a better man
If I forgive you, but frankly, I never can
I'm a frequent flyer to places you never been
You in conversations talkin' bout paper you never spend, uh
I caught the hints late, all women lie and men fake
You was my O-Dog like Larenz Tate
Thought my relationships was in shape
Guess I was blind 'cause bonds grow strong and then break
Yeah, how you kickin' me while I'm down?
I blame me, 'cause all you did to me I allowed
What's crazy is, you never figured we'd run the town
I bet you'd take it back if you coulda pictured me where I'm now
Watch who you call a friend, the game filled with snakes
Who use real as a shield to conceal they fake
So if you ask me, ""What's love?"" then I still would say
""What's love? Love is whatever, you can still betray (Damn)

So lately

Turn my back on society, seventeen
Cause they told me that I couldn't have a dream
But I got it, dropped out of college, MTV
Now I'm all over the world on yo screen
Now I'm front cover like girls on magazines
Now I'm chopped not slopped, shoutout OG Ron C
Now I'm on the radio in Seattle
Now I'm out in Belgium, I don't even travel
Oooo what happened?

I'm watchin' people give up
Contemplating suicide
Tryna' tell my people we much smarter when we unify
Tryna' move these units, out here livin' like it's do or die
We be on MTV, often dreams is self belief
Got my confidence, my self esteem is shootin' through the roof
I'ma stay inside my house, lock myself inside my booth
Got my gin, I got my juice
Got my family to balance me
I don't need no rules
I'ma boss, watch the world spin off

[Intro]
Nadie me va a joder
Odio a todo el mundo
Yo creo que soy mejor que todo el mundo
¿Y tú sabes qué? Oh
Yo creo que es todo el mundo lo sepa, ah

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yuh, I'm cool on your opinion of my strategy
Phone full of women all mad at me
Cause they ain't on my mind like they use to
Cause I ain't got the time that I use to
Money tight as usual, but it's cool, because it's coming
And I don't ever follow your strut
I don't ever follow money, I just follow my gut
Now they following Russ
Yeah your boys gettin bigger now
Y'all careers dying, start pouring out the liquor now
Been at this since 06
Before it started being cool, to drop albums with no hits
I'm out here coming for all of it
I want all the acknowledgment
I want all the accomplishments
I want cars that's astonishing
Plus the house that my mommas in
Should be big as a continent
I make good on my promises
50 bitches to party with
Man, the world is my audience
I'm just tryna' give my statement
Billboard from a basement
The type of focus where you wonder where the day went
But do it all again
How to be a millionaire
It's getting harder to call a friend
Too many hidden agendas
You 50/50 with your character
My life is on the line
There's gone always be a barrier
Between me and most
I never let 'em too close
With the girls it's no different
I can't be falling for hoes
That's why I keep to myself
I stay recording tryna' upgrade
My life to the nights full of lights, cash, and runways
I haven't had a Monday since 18
I knew in high school I could go pro like KG
Lately it's been looking like I made the right decision
Found my way outta' the dark, I gotta' flash light vision
If her ass right but the face left, then I'm dippin'
I need a chick three for three like Pippin
Hang my jersey up, It's worthy of the rafters
I know their game, I ain't worried 'bout these rappers
It's too predictable now, it's so political now
And Im sorry if I sound a little cynical now
It's just that most my favorite rappers are invisible now
Everyday I make a song that's just habitual now
[Refrain: Russ]
Ain't nobody gonna' do it like me
Ain't nobody gonna fill the void I see but me, so here I go

[Verse 2: Russ]
Twelve shots like the cops, now I'm wasted
It's in the blood of America to be racist
Land of the taken
Home of the cover it all up and don't say shit
Act like it ain't happen, cut, copy, paste it
Put it on every channel doesn't matter if you change it
I'm off it though
It ain't where I've gone
It's where I've gotta go
I tell these local girls what they wanna' know
Never fuck 'em twice, cause I won't be there to catch em
Self belief and a passion this is the natural reaction
I be singing these ballads
Like a young Mike Bolton
Sprewell with the raps though
Like Russ might choke him
Keep a few eyes open
I'm everywhere, I'm omnipresent
Wired with the drive of a Bugatti engine
I've been running non stop since fourteen
Ain't no time to slow up, man I need more beats
Even though I got 500 sitting in a playlist
I'm starting to realize that the money won't change shit
I'm starting to realize that y'alls basic ain't my basic
On the plane to the A making a list of all the shit matters
Y'all opinions didn't make it
'Bout to be a A list celebrity
Wife me up a singer
Hope she gotta' accent
Hope she drinks liquor
Board of advisors, I can count on four fingers
Leave the middle one open
To let you know I ain't sweet
I've been a shepherd my whole life
I can't relate to the sheep
It's a shame you asleep
But I'm about to make your bed shake
Bow down to me I'm the Sensei
Let's play who's gon be here in a decade
Lotta yall are barely even making it to the next day
[Outro: Russ]
Man
The fuck?
The fuck are y'all doing man?
You out here getting platforms and shit
Turning up talking 'bout dumb shit
Man
And the crazy shit is that, like, people believe you because you're poppin'
So you can say whatever you want
But that shit sound dumb as fuck
And all y'all got low fucking IQs
And all y'all figure out what's poppin' off in the water, like twenty-eight
Cause y'all lack guidance and that's not-

Yeah, just copped a mansion and my parents a crib
Listening to doubt never worked for me but my arrogance did
They love to hate, they love to hate, how ironic, I know
She loves my long hair and my tattoos, how iconic, I know
Women pounce often and my sound poppin'
Y'all are clout hoppin', while I'm house shoppin'
You should make more moves and less announcements
I'm having sex with spouses
Watch me invest and count this, I got the best accountants
I'm looking at the aftermath off all my hours
Unfortunately, I rarely take the time to smell my flowers
Used to move around a lot, used to have to pack houses
Now I'm on the road playing shows for packed houses
Now I'm in Toronto smokin' maple leaves
I got the catalog of branches outside of the label's tree
You can't label me, I made all my shots
But that was when the crowd was ghost
Now the world is watching me, time to go repeat results

With skin like cinnamon, bitch it's a Tuesday

I'm throwin' a coup de
Ta da bitch, I'm here, y'all pop up and disappear

What y'all know 'bout doin' sold out shows around the globe?
I bring the hoes out, the come-up's documented, you should scroll down
And peep game, you can say he changed 'cause he went and achieved fame
But he landed where he aimed
So fuck the chest you thumpin', fuck the threats you publish
I'm up in your city doin' shows, address is public
I never listened to the churches
I listen to Kanye, Eminem, Nipsey, J. Cole, Kendrick, Drake and Jay-Z verses
Rap is the new sermon, rappers are the preachers
Rappers are the doctors and the teachers, the world needs us

People say I'm cocky, people say I'm arrogant
I think lack of confidence is very un-American
Miss me with comparisons
Y'all can't hold a candle to me, you gon' need more paraffin
Bunch of fuckin' zombies poppin' pills and sippin' heroin
Y'all are so embarrassin'
Got your wifey runnin' all her fingers through my hair again
I'm starin' in her soul, your bitch has no control
She's lookin' at my platinum plaques, your bitch ass still ain't gold
I'm hot globally, you popped locally
I'm noticing this game hasn't really noticed me
It's okay, I understand, I wasn't in your plan
But y'all gon' come around 'cause I'm the motherfuckin' man

But who are you? I don't even think you know
They don't believe that I plan it, like Pluto
I'm interrupting the conversation
Enough with the observations
I'm fucking up the structure
Standing up for the population
It's real shit coming through your playlist
Family needs food, bills need payments
But I see money in the bank with my name on it
Rearranging rules, yeah I'm changing up the game on ya
I got a chip that weighs the size of a brick
I might flip and do some shit that's gonna' help me get rich quick
This ain't a thing you should try
I protect this with my life
Cause my life is what I gave
For my life I would die
[Hook: Russ]
I dare you to come and try it
But nobody's shaking round here
Yes I got it so you want it
But I ain't see you here last year
Bet you won't try it
No no
I bet you won't try it

[Verse 2: Russ]
All this time in between got me anxious
Family looking at me like, save us
I got to get to where I'm going now, oh oh
Stepping up to the plate when they need me
This is what I practiced for
This is what I'm asking for, for, for, for
I made my name get bigger
Stayed with my faith like liquor up in my vains
My trigger fingers my brain
I figured I should do me
Looking back I was blinded by what I really couldn't see
23, I'm so happy I didn't blow at 17
They be stupid
I don't play against you
I play against the idea of me losing
See the blueprint I sketched out
I was right all along to let your opinions get left out
[Hook: Russ]
I dare you to come and try it
But nobody's shaking round here
Yes I got it so you want it
But I ain't see you here last year
Bet you won't try it
No no
I bet you won't try it1Embed"

Yeah, you know my stress stretches ZIP Codes
Tryna go 100 on E, tryna flip lows
Into muses, do what I do's
If deaths comes in threes then pain comes in twoses
Thank you Mom
You're the only thing that keeps me here
I bought depression on the low, but it wasn't cheap this year
I think I reached a tier where everyday I keep a tear
Tucked in the holster like I'm tryna conceal a piece in here
I need peace in here, I'll do whatever
On the road to finding happiness, I'll lose whatever
That's how I'm feelin' as of late, got a lot up on my plate
These are shoes I got exclusive, I don't expect you to relate
It’s not written on my face, nah, it's buried deep
They see me as strong, so I can't come off very weak
I been havin' scary dreams of death destruction and despair
I guess I'm lost tryna find someone who really cares
Damn, fuck

[Chorus]
And if you reminisce
I hope you find some shit
That helps you benefit and alright
These are crucial times
I wish the pain in me committed suicide and alright (Yeah)

Let my Mom control my will, alright
Leave my friends with all a mill', alright

I've been outta state
You've been stuck in yours
It's not personal
When you call me and I ignore you, damn
I'm just tryna detach, detach
I rarely ever get time to relax
But when I do I'm just tryna rejuvenate, meditate

[Chorus]
But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)
I fuck with you from a distance

[Verse 2]
You want me to free time
To talk to you, but I
Only talk to you when I got free time
I guess that's the difference
Between Ms. and Mrs
You lookin' for someone who's got time

[Chorus]
But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)
I fuck with you from a distance
[Verse 3]
Yeah, she don't really care about the fame or the dollars
She be bad as fuck in a hoodie and some joggers
I be on the road ignoring all her FaceTimes
Not tryna break hearts, but I'm on my break time
I just did tours non-stop
Had girls on all fours and on top
I had sisters, I had cousins doin' freak shit
Now I'm tryna chill, smoke weed, make these hits
I know I promised
But sometimes shit pops up when you're poppin'
Damn, I know we text a lot
When I see you, best believe we having sex a lot
Connect the dots
Before you try and draw conclusions
Love is feeling like it's all illusions
I'm still young, lemme go through my phases
Lemme adjust, girl, I just got famous

But I fuck with you from a distance (yeah, oh)
I fuck with you from a distance (yeah)

Please, love, just give me patience
My love is complicated (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Had to remind myself, had to re-find myself
Had to refine myself, had to define myself
Had to resign myself, had to rely on myself
Got a lot of shit I don't even want
I'm sendin' everything back though
All the energy I don't even want
I'm sendin' everything back though
Even though I brought it on myself
I'm sendin' everything back though

[Verse 1]
Yeah, give me patience as I navigate this phase, it's
Hopefully up on its way out like stories in Vegas
No more secrets, like Papa Roach, I'ma cop a Ghost
Hit the Galapagos, lose track of time as if my watch is broke
Impossible is my current address
Lettin' people get too close is my current regret
Fuck it, yeah, your moms heard about me
Twenty-seven tomorrow, my mom's worried 'bout me, yeah

Yeah, this could take some time (It's my fault)

[Verse 2]
She's overwhelmed, but that comes with the dinner
Dealin' with losers in their feelings, that comes with the winner
She's fallin' quicker than usual, hopin' it's mutual
She got options, he's got options, she's hopin' he's suitable
This is new for her, she's never fucked with no one that can do what he can do for her
Not talkin' 'bout the money, talkin' 'bout how he can groove with her
She be introverted, he be huggin' her, hah
She be shy as hell, but he be fuckin' her, uh
She's in heaven, never loved until he came along
He wrote love songs 'bout her and she sang along
Picture perfect, that's accordin' to the verses
That's the problem, though
Feelings growin' fast, she's tryna stop 'em though
She don't trust him all the way
She knows that he's entertainin' bitches that he shouldn't
They can't fuck with her, she's demonstratin'
Self-preservation, uh, utilizin' patience
Even though she wants him badder than ever like a vacation that he's never had
[Chorus]
Yeah, this could take some time (Except for that one little time)
My heart is under maintenance
Tell me that you see why

Hello Mom and Dad
Waddup Frank (laughing)
You wanted me to do this right? (laughing)
Yah, do it
Waddup Gianna


[Verse 1: Russ]

Communicating while anonymous doesn't accomplish too much
So imma get this fucking platform, keep on talkin' my stuff
Reachin' everybody
From the South Side of Atlanta
To the place I'm more familiar with but I paint panoramas
That'll make you trip like I love Lucy
By the way I took a trip and I love Lucy
She introduced me to the truth
I wrap a noose around your boss real quick
Kick his stool out, and make his boss' boss feel it
And nah my balls don't fit
In the palm of my hands
So don't ask me to grab 'em, I let 'em hang I'm the man
Fuck spelling it out
I'm yelling it out
Y'all flip then you flip
You're not hip you're not hop
I'm just a product of listenin'
To washed up artists submittin'
Feeble attempts to stay on, so all that garbage your givin'
Is getting you thrown out
I'm thrown, leave me alone I'm in my zone now
Too many clowns
Diemon is full of lions it's time to roam now
And my life, is a good book
Bugus, rollin' good kush
Never house a bitch because they bite and bark, woof woof
Look, look
The world is pulling me down I'm about to push push
And let the visions in my head pull my sled, Balto, mush mush
Y'all lay beneath the tush tush
And your pockets stay empty
Because your mouth is full of pussy
Go dive in ambition
Swim around in some talent
Bust a nut full of visions
Then hit it again with some passion
And get it crackin' like the sea monster
I see monsters with all that
Fee-fi-foh-fum
But y'all ain't scarin' no one so just fall back
Because it's D-I-E-M-O-N
'Till the motherfucking world ends
And I'm probably where your girl is
[Hook: 2Pac]

Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot
So I'm doing what I do
And don't say shit 'till you walk in my shoes

Now them same mothafuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder If the Lord ever heard of me (uh)
I need loot so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nothin' left to lose so I'm singin' nigga blues

[Verse 2: Russ]

Imma, heavy thinker, light smoker, henny drinker
Gotta gift, for the game, wrapped around my middle finger
No semi-circles in this DIEMON shit
Squares don't linger
I'm your dudes favorite rapper, and your bitches favorite singer
It's Jerry Springer in this hotel room, minus the violence
We questioning each other on some who what where and why shit
But back to the living out the dream or tryna find it
Fuck it I think I found it
Fuck that I know I found it
Y'all old dudes ain't new no more, y'all need a fountain
Y'all be king of the hill motherfuckers, I got the mountain
Y'all shoutin' making commotion
Barely making a wave I'll make the ocean
And park my yacht on your property with no apology for show boatin'
And I've met God a lot but I've never met Jesus
I've even met the Devil and kicked it with her on some G shit
She showed me how to get to hell
I showed her how to leave it
And close that fucking door shut as I walk towards my freedom (yah, do it)
[Hook: 2Pac]

Now them same motherfuckers wanna murder me
And I wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot
So I'm doing what I do
And don't say shit 'till you walk in my shoes

Now them same mothafuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder If the Lord ever heard of me (uh)
I need loot so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nothin' left to lose so I'm singin' nigga blues

Don't get it fucked up you can still get dropped

Yeah, yeah
Oh, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I been climbin', the view's spectacular
Even if I crash, I'd rather drive than be the passenger
Slightly philosophical, I wanna die young as old as possible
As of late, I been feelin' responsible
For my family's livelihood, I think tonight we should
Celebrate the fact that I'm a star and that the likelihood
Of me blowin', in the next couple of months is definite
Anticipate me comin' like the porn stars in my messages
Speakin' of porn stars, all my exes all Latinas
Hits them like tequila when they see me in arenas, and yeah
It hasn't happened yet but trust me, y'all gon' pay for
Bein' devils in disguise as everything I prayed for
I learned a lot though from all the above
I guess God got a job at the comedy club
But fuck that, I'm buzzin' now, whole industry flockin'
'Cause I'm the people's champ and you just industry poppin', c'mon

[Chorus]
I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgency
[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah, I swear I had a year that you can't ignore
I swear that no one's ever won, how I'm winnin' before
Pretty women like Julia Roberts come to the concerts
And scream daddy but I ain't about to adopt her
I gotta conquer and collect
Every motherfuckin' check, tryna pay a couple tuitions
Write 'em off as an expense
Let the takeover commence
If I say it, I believe it, you just dream of success
I stay awake to achieve it, it's crazy seeing
Girls I used to crush on, fuckin' to my love songs
Yeah, I'm gettin' commas but I'm 'bout to get my run on
Flights bi-coastal, everythin' paid for
That's just how it goes when you take what they wait for
Things are pickin' up, I'm just tryna find the peace
Some people shine and give it back but my shine is not a lease
This is permanently owned, if I lose it, it's on my terms
I don't wish for shit, I desire then acquire

[Chorus]
I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgency
[Verse 3]
No failure is final, no success is permanent
It's madness, mom really 'bout to march like the tournament
Certain shits been fuckin' up my days and nights
Like yeah, my parents got no money so I guess I gotta pay the price
At least I have it, let me get my blessings straight
If this was last year, we'd be food stamps and Section 8
Awkward conversations with my dad he's feelin' cursed
He's askin' me for gas it's like the roles are reversed
Monitor what Russ is makin', feelin' like I'm suffocatin'
Feelin' like I need 10 shots and 2 blunts to chase it
Acceptin' what is and lettin' go of what was
Havin' faith in what could be if I just one up
Myself every time and let the chips fall where they may
I got pit stops in LA, makin' shit pop every day, yeah
People stumble on stones that I use to step on
The chips I mentioned earlier, I pick 'em up and bet on myself

[Chorus]
I been travelin' a lot now
Got to find the time to
Take it in and take a step back
Kick it with the family
I cannot help it that I'm focused on my vision
All the time, it just feels like it's an emergency
I tell my mama, don't you cry, I'll be back soon
You know I'm always moving with a sense of urgencyEmbed"
