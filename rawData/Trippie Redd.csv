Good to now be here
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always feeling fucked up either by love or no love
""I thought you was married to the single life"", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
I should've said somethin'
You said the only thing wrong with money is you ain't have enough of it
You said you deserve better, and now so do I
Anyways, the best part of us was me
When you got with me, you were a genius
Now without me, you have to live life as an idiot
I don't write songs, I write life, I told you that
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit

[Verse]
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart, yeah23Embed"

Sucker free living, I'ma say that that's the motto
So for any nigga on that sucker shit, I'm no ho bro
Might just have to drop a bomb, Han Solo
Got me bickin' back, being bool, Quasimoto
All about my paper gotta get my fucking dough ho
Always on the fucking go-go, you a bitch like Tony Romo
Niggas came around now they extinct like Dodos
Meanwhile I'm in New York fucking up SoHo
Just bagged a new chick, Caroline, nickname Coco
Took her to the telly now lil' baby going loco
She just give me face, ain't no fucking, that's a no-no
And she going thirty early, dirty, no soap though
I laugh at the haters, everything they say a joke though
And I'm screaming, Fuck 12, all these foul ass po-po, yeah, uh

But nowadays I really miss my fucking idols, so that's the title
I grab a bible, pray for my rivals
Dead on arrival, I swear this shit to me like a cycle

They need survival, they need to rehearse a recital
I just sit back and listen to old Wayne songs
And get dome from a bitch while I brainstorm
And spit flames while also making it rain storm

You see I can't ignore it
And you niggas don't see it's in your brain to snore
And you sleep on me until you can't no more
And don't fake on me and try to play the boy
I don't know why I feel like nobody loves me
Or why they feel like my intention's something ugly
Or why I feel like everyone needs something from me
Or why I feel like everyone just saying fuck me
Or why I feel like the opposition gon' buss me
If I gave you my heart, would you still love me?
Lately, baby, I feel like nobody trust me
Is it just me?

Smoke up all the weed in 24, I'm a poor, poor, poor soul
More and more rain flows, black Rolls, just cruise
No umbrella, no coat, I'm stuck, she's cold, yeah

[Chorus: HoodyBaby]
It just seems like I've been screwing up
Everything I touch gets to ruining
My homies call it growing pains
I'm trying not to go insane
Rain falls down
Staring at my window
You know when it rains, it pours
I can't even lie no more
Tears fallin' down on my window
Rain falls down
[Outro]
Rain falls down
Rain falls down
Rain falls down
Rain falls down6Embed"
