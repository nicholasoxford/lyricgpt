Ricky Racks, I see you!
Thugger!
YSL for life, bitch
Yeah fuck you, your momma and everything else
Yung Shad, you killed this track
Free the GOAT!

[Chorus]
That's my best friend, that's my best friend, flexin'
Big ol' booty bitch missus from Texas, what's next is
I'm gon' skeet off, lil' nigga come catch me, catch me
And that's my bestie, my bestie, my best friend, go best friend
Nigga livin' TTG and everything is still on fleek
Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek
Hundred thousand dollars inside my pants, my shit on fleek
Hey-yeah! Yeah

[Verse 1]
Take them boys to school, swagonometry
Bitch I'm bleedin' bad, like a bumble bee
Hold up! Hold it, hold it, nigga proceed
I'ma eat that booty just like groceries
Eat on that coochie, lay that bitch down like ""let's do it""
No Tiger, bitch, eat that wood, eat that wood
Supplier, bitch, I got pistols, no wood
I want them tacos that are Meagan Good
Helicopter choppin' with the buzz
Stuff them racks inside them if they nudge
Bang that other side, nigga curb
And my reefer louder than a speaker
Yeah my niece is hangin' with The Beatles
If you ever find her, better keep her
37 cameras for the sneakers
Goin' out like Ox or Beanie Sigel
Send a cop, I can't wait to mistreat 'em
Forcin' your ho, I can't wait to mislead 'em
And beat 'em, they ain't my people

Bad bitch rollin' wit' me, she gon' smile 'cause she on fleek

Hey-yeah! Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you how I spent a couple hundreds today
I done cut back on that lean, I'm on that Hen' and D'ussé
Don't do no talkin', when you see him, you better shoot in his face
I got a hundred bitches that can't wait to replace
Michael Jackson, nigga, Thugger Jackson moon walkin'
The S.L.I.M.E. army tool shoppin'
Me a horny goat, I'm boolin' at the bull stop
No I can't get arrested 'cause I'm talkin' 'bout my necklace
I'ma put that bitch in the buck, I'm a dog, let's get stuck
My lil' sister Dora, eat them Lucky Charms and give me luck
Waddup cuz? Here yo cup, call my Bloods, bring my bup
Your crew suck, don't got bucks, these ain't drugs, nigga

A verse from me is like eleven birds

Then I observe, just how you curve
Then told the nigga that they gotta wait for it

Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

Who the fuck told you that Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars, and I also got rentals, and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceiling
Stoner my lifestyle
I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud
That money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around

Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it

Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I gotta pass like the staff

Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic

I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot
I created history and made me a lot
He tried to diss me and ended on Fox
We call 'em chopsticks 'cause they gonna chop
Took her out of Follies 'cause her pussy pop
I run it like Nike, we got it on lock

[Verse 1: Gunna]
Cartier eye
I'm the bossman in a suit but no tie
I can't be sober, I gotta stay high
Pour me some syrup in a Canada Dry
Ridin' in the spaceship like Bonnie and Clyde
Don't worry, baby, I keep me some fire
Shenenehs and Birkins, she cannot decide
The latest Mercedes her go-to surprise
Don't sleep on miss lady, her pussy a prize
Dick in her back while I'm grippin' her sides
Bigger Maybach, this ain't regular size
We really fly, we like pelican glide
Bitch, you ain't slick, I can tell the disguise
Upgraded my wrist, put baguettes in that Sky
She sing, I might sign her and change her whole life
I told her to gargle and work on her highs
[Chorus: Gunna]
Everything litty, I love when it's hot
Turned up the city, I broke off the notch
Got some more millis, I keep me a knot

I took the Bentley coupe back, then I hopped in a Cayenne (Skrrt)
I put the bitch in the front of the Bentley, in front of the driver (Skrrt)
Ayy, man, this synthetic weed, you can't smoke in the Rolls Royce, woah, woah (Yeah, yeah)
I'm still double cupped up, I'm drinkin', I shoot off your tires, huh (Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm in the coupe by myself
I had to kick a door when I was 5
Keep the awards on the shelf

I'm sick and tired of these young niggas act like they firin', they tellin' these lies
Actin' like they the ones created this and they get all the drip from my guys
Yeah, Cartier eyes
Cartier coat, Cartiers the watch
Cartier love, Cartier the thot
Cartier specs, buffalo on the side
Princess cut diamonds, they Cartier, yeah
Cartier bag for the Cartier thot
Sky Wrangler coupe with two hundred the dash
Cartier jeans, ain't no way I can sag
Ain't no way I'ma ever gon' go out bad
I can't go out, no way I'ma go out
I just grip on her ass and I show out
I sit like a champ and I wait on a hold-out
I just whip up a new Chanel Patek
I whip with the wrist and I don't break the door out
Turn the whole top floor to a whorehouse
Hundred racks in ones, dude brought the flood out (Oh)

Know they gon' ride 'til the death (Ooh)
Had some good years, ain't no way I get tired
I gotta do what I feel
Every day Super Bowl, fuck it, oh well
I put a lot on myself
In the field, Richard Mille on like Odell (Let's go)
She slid her hand down my pants just to grab the torpedo (Doo-doo-doo)
I had to go back and link with my slimes like I'm thirteen and zero (It's lit)
I told her, ""Baby, this not the remix, this a part of the sequel"" (Part of the seq')
No, we not livin' the same, we not makin' the same, we not equal (No), yeah, yeah, yeah
Look, mom, I can fly

Head bust a microwave, shit, didn't take him two minutes
You know that there's some straps in the club, they let my crew in
I might just do the Michael Vick man and cook it left hand
If you ain't talkin' 'bout buyin' grams then I'm a deaf man
I can make the dope do numbers, the Stacey Augmon
I told my bitch to dye her hair red like Dennis Rodman

We got London on the track
Got my bae with me, you know what I'm sayin'?

If she don’t get what she want she whine

Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that

[Verse 1]
I know she livin' for a nigga, dyin' for a nigga

Yeah, I'ma give you a couple bands, want some more boobs on you (Want some more)
Hey, I'ma sit back and pay attention like school on you
Yeah, I'ma shoot inside that pussy like a wholly on you
Goddamn, I'm sorry, B, I know you'd accepted my apology
I know that ass fat, apple bottom please
I need a deep throat baby, swallow me
I love it when you're around baby, follow me (Follow)
I only eat green, yeah, koala leaf

She never say no, she ain't stallin' me
I kept my heart locked up in a safe, hey

No, you can't see it, it is tragic by your face (Ooh)

Looked up baby and say goodbye
I tied my ties, she no longer cry, look you in your eyes
Tell you that, I know she worth

Yah, my mama say that she ain’t perfect
But if this is how I'm feelin', it's gonna work
Yeah, roll me some kush I don't want no purp (hey)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I broke her heart, now my heart hurt
I don't know why but I done cut down on that syrup
At least I got that lil' bitch ballin', she don't gotta work
Oh-no-no, she ain't had no job, but she having purses
Yeah-yeah-yeah, she know I'm the truth, places I'm in first
No-no-no, I don't want you bitches, y'all basic and thirsty (Y'all soft)
Yeah-yeah, she taught me well, it took some time, but it was worth it
She get on top and she ride it, Kentucky derby
You should see, I count that money like a nerd bitch
I'ma ball some with my dawgs but they ain't Courage
Her whole body same color, I call it perfect

Since she don't get what she want she whine
I reminisce when I get high (Yeah)
Looked up baby and say goodbye (Bobby Bruh)

I did this shit that they thought I wouldn't do and I made it (Made it)
I was so down bad and so fucked up, couldn't make over eighty (For real)
I lost some friends, that was so fucked up
And I know that they hate me (Fuck, fuck)
Thugger, he gave me a chance and I had to take it (Gimme that)
(But I) used to trap on the block with the 380
Now when I pull up, they gotta pay me (Skrrt)
I came from nothing, born in the eighties (I came from nothing)
These niggas actors like Patrick Swayze
I gotta get it, I can't be lazy (I gotta get it)
Didn't have a dime so my mama crazy (Didn't have a dime)
Ran up a sack with Thugger, baby
Man, this shit so amazing
[Outro: Young Thug]
Yeah, new Patek Phillipe
Cost a hundred bands, man
Clear, with nothing' on it
Then I went and seen Elliott and iced that motherfucker out, you dig?
That's on Big Duck, that's on all 6, know I'm sayin'?
I got like a hundred-seventy, hundred-eighty thousand dollar watch, bro
And it glow up, um, gleen— green at night
And when the sun hit it on the plane
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah, I used to do this shit to maintain
'Til my—'til I started usin' fourteen percent of my brain
And that left me with five stars worth of stains, you dig?

Ooh-woo, diamonds peek-a-boo
Ooh-woo, I done fucked her crew
Ooh-woo, I done did the robbin'
I done did the jackin', now I'm full rappin'
I put on my brothers, I put on my bitch
Had to wear the dress 'cause I had a stick
You know where the bag at, tell me where it is
I came from rags to riches, I'm the shit
I can no longer disguise it, bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I got cars galore, lil' bitch, 'cause I'm rich
I escaped every one of the licks 'cause I was supposed to be rich
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cop, I'm tellin' you just how it is

[Verse 1]
Put it in a Uber, send it to a shooter
Ask me how they do it, kickin' shit, Ryu, Ken
Put it in a cab, send it to a Arab
Hit 'em with the MAC now, now his whole body scabbed
Cash on delivery (Ayy)
G.O.A.T. talk of the century (Oh)
No time for gibberish, all the critics hearin' this
All the bitches lipstick, and her pussy slippery
I can call a troop, go by the name of Duke
Kidnap a kangaroo, I can send a moose (Woo)
Niggas stole a chain, but I ain't worried, fool
I'ma keep on spinnin' 'til they tell me who

I can tell you how to talk the most impeccable shit
I can show you how to walk like you got decimals, bitch
Show you how I can get the top from all the top ten bitches
I got white Adderalls and I have amoxicillin
I got lights on, baby, I got moths in this bitch
No fly zone, caught you like you're Moss in this bitch
Growin' tycoon and I took some losses, you bitch
I'm a boss, but I don't like to take a loss in this bitch (Wheezy outta here)
Such a player but I cake and cuddle all of my bitches
I got layers, I got millions, I got all type of buildings
Fuck around and air the pussy nigga out like linen
Last nigga tried me almost got popped in Lenox
Ask the cops, ask the detectives, they know all the business
Ask the cops and the detectives, all the jurisdictions
Ask the kids at school who ambition all the missions
Gave the lawyer close to two mil', he handle all the killings
I don't know and I don't wanna know who 'flaged Bentleys
I don't know what's goin' with bro, I think they all spillin'
We don't speak 'bout shit on wax, it's all mob business
We known to kill the biggest cats of all kitties

I went got the racks and I did it again
Ayy, I think she a twin
Plus she got red calamari skin
Ayy, you don't got no wins
You should grab something white and just throw it on in
I went to school, got suspended
I told her I want some head, bobby pin
If the lil... don't got class, yeah, we call it truancy
I ain't had no money to spend
I got my first check and went paid off my rent

[Verse 1: Jaden Smith & Young Thug]
I poured a four from the clouds down
And my head floating in bliss (Goddamn)
I'm on the phone with big bro now (Damn)
He told me keep Benz on the race (Goddamn)
Until you see it like this, I promise man you'd never think it exists
Straight out a jet to the crib, I'm quick with the switch
Man we never miss, okay (God)
'Bout to turn up in the club, man, back the fuck up
We ain't takin' no pictures
See all the wings in the front, it's us
We had to triple the digits
See all those sexy mamas blowing kisses, man
We had to grant all they wishes (We grants-)
Casamigos got me spinnin'
But I want some spendin' some out wit' some dealers
Let's go (Goddamn)

I'm rocking Dior Sauvage (Damn)
I'm higher than Scotty, they calling me Pippen (God)

Money's the reason I gotta take Ritalin
You niggas don't care 'bout women
Just shut the fuck up, yeah I'm taking care plenty
I put Chanel on a belt buckle, of when my price is half off
I keep a stick for my cover, got way more girls than Hugh Hefner
Got the same name as the butler
But more money than Ashley and her mother
Got a backwood full of sherbert, I'm 'bout to smoke like a murder

Ay, let me pour up some Act, got some brand new graffiti

Rocking Giuseppe Zanotti's a night
I spent half a million designer on kits

I got so high, went off the equator, I feel like Buzz Lightyear
I met a broad, skinny like nails, and I was richer than ice cream

Wheezy outta here

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
My career 'bout to blast like bubbly
I'm not waitin' for her to say she love me
I can tell she fuck with me, man, trust me
I got a ten-year-old mink still ain't fuzzy
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ridin' in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
I ball at Barneys, new Christian Dior
I took the jet to the New York store
She lick while I'm drivin', I'm stainin' the floor
I took it off track, now I'm ridin' in sport (Yeah)
You stay in your feelings, you never my boy
I can't come to the hood, I pull a decoy
Another body drop and they screamin' my name
I'm goin' to L.A. on a private plane
Could never come back and my family straight (Grrah)
I'm touchable? No, I'm too rich and too paid
Skeleton Cartier, black diamonds face
Pull up too deep like a fuckin' parade
Old jealous-ass niggas tryna fuck up my pay (Ha)
Blast off, Rolls-Royce Cullinan rain (Broke niggas)
I put baguettes in my wrist and my neck and my ears and my motherfuckin' chains (Chains)
This drip out the trenches, I know you gon' dig it, I come through this motherfucker plain (Woah)
I cut up my wrist, soakin' wet (Yeah) and Coachella keep callin', they won't see the face
I took her to China and changed up her climate and now she ain't talkin' the same (Woah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Five nights up, still poppin' and ragin'
The SVR still livin' deranged (Yeah)
I want her, she wanted the same
Hit 'em both same time, both glad that they came (It's lit)
Keep me a vibe, but can't keep it contained
Know I keep me some dawgs, always keep 'em in training (Oh)
Tat' a logo on the back of my brain
Don't ask me what the fuck am I thinkin'
Back of these walls, I'm full of that drank
Eric came through with a little entertainment (It's lit)
Area 29, got it lookin' like space
Houston, it's a problem way we bustin' up faces and shit
I came with the snakes, no squids (Straight up)
I broke out the game with a 456
She lovin' the fest', I see it
She lovin' the fest' (Straight up, straight up)
Yeah, I see it on her face, and I'm lovin' that body
In lace, I know you lovin' Spider and Jack
Yeah, I know you got taste, if you love yourself, take shots with me
If I love you, I'll drop you a pin to a time and a place (Wait)

[Verse 3: Drake]
YSL'll put a nigga six feet

Been on the charts for five hundred weeks, so somebody love when I speak
Doin' this shit just to show we get down in the 6, man, it's bigger than me
Texas ranch so big, that shit is perfect for the dippin'
I don't care how wet I get her, she won't catch me—
Three-twenty-five on the dashboard
Ride in the Porsche, rockin' Tom Ford
Rockin' her bed and the headboard
What, what, what, what?
Buyin' out Louis and Christian Dior

I been chewin' on that chewy and this ecstasy
I been kickin', bitch, and drippin' Louis quilt
Hundred Percocets, I took like four or five off the rip
My dick hard, bitch, come get after it
Growin' up, I kept a gun like a veteran
Soul snatcher, promise you ain't comin' back from this
She bad, treat her like the principal at teacher list
Yeah, make sure that the opposites kickin' it

Fuck it
Inside of my house look like Colombia, I love it
Bloody fingerprints on my fingers from countin' hundreds
Learned from watching Goodfellas to keep it in the cupboard
Guns are just like pussy, pull it out, you better bust it
I might be in traffic in rush hour like Chris Tucker
Lord, I keep that MC Hammer, no, you cannot touch it
I might go on tour and fuck a daughter and her mother
Pour some drank that's red like Robitussin, ayy
If I get pulled over, put my coke inside your crack, yeah
We get home, I pop a pill and I'll blow out your back, yeah
If I die today, like Makaveli, bring me back, yeah
If I got a problem, call my slime and he say, ""Slatt,"" yeah

I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow

[Intro: Young Thug & Strick]
We out in Italy on the water (Slime, what's going on? It's feeling like they won)
Me and Strick recordin' (Gotta get back up, you a Black Panther's son)
Smokin' weed, smokin' dope (I gotta tell you that you'll die slow, die slow, die slow)
Drinkin' a lil' lean
I actually did good, I ain't drink nothin' but a pint this whole tour
Yeah, on tour, I done missed my son's birthday
It's, uh, July the 15th
Nah, I— I lowkey, like, really see people ridin' past on boats right now out the window (Die slow, die slow)
It's just the— just the penthouse suite, it's nothin'— nothin' major, yeah

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Told the lawyer that my brother ain't goin' back to prison
I don't give a fuck if I gotta turn that nigga Jehovah Witness
I'm just seekin' for God's soul 'cause I know something's missin'
Comme des Garçons boxers and I came from penny-pinchin'
Came out the struggle, nigga, I really had lost a brother, nigga
Got to fightin' with the deputy sheriff, I almost lost my mother, nigga

[Interlude: Young Thug]
And that's funny, that's funny, like
My mama had broke up with my dad for having another kid on her, and, um
He had came home one day and he saw, um, a car in the driveway
It was an off-duty sheriff— ahem
A deputy sheriff that my mom was fuckin' with, and, uh
They had a few words, and it ended with, um, my dad shooting and ended up in the hospital in a coma, and, uh, yeah, so
Fast forward like eight years later, so my sisters had got to fighting, and, uh
And they— and they— and they had a family member that was a deputy sheriff, and, um
My mom came outside to goddamn stop the fighting
The lady had got in the car and just pulled off doing at, like, sixty miles per hour, ran my mom over
She had a stroke and shit, but she alright
Yeah
[Verse 2: Young Thug]
I always knew I wasn't gon' be gay
I had her sendin' pictures to my mom phone when I was like eight, tuh
I always knew that I'd be great
'Cause my coach told me I was slow, but I was runnin' at a fast pace, huh
They tryna divide us and conquer the world with it
They got a couple of the guys and all of the girls with it
But I'm a mastermind, I see right through it
I see that you got couple diamonds and the rest of 'em pearls in it
They say you poor 'cause you Black right to your face (Yeah)
They say where you live, you'll never be able to own that place
My father said you can change it all with your performance
And by the way, your life is a VV stone charm
They take the land and then detect who all can come
But I tell you with a long-sleeve, I bear arms, ayy
I'm high enough to be on the Milky Way 'til morning
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than any morning
If you want it, you gon' get up earlier than anyone
Put on my socks, grab my Glock, the stick under the couch
Tie off my shoes, you in flip-flops, and it's top of the top
R.I.P. Nipsey, know what I'm sayin'?

[Bridge: Young Thug & Strick]
If you were the one in my shoes, would you love?
Would you love, would you love, would you love, would you love?
If you were the one in
If you were the one in the prejudice, so why for hostility? Yeah
Would you run away, or would you come back nightly? (Woo)
[Refrain: Strick]
I gotta tell you that you'll die tonight
You go against these people, you gon' die slow, die slow, die slow

[Outro: Strick & Young Thug]
Slime, what's going on? It's feeling like they won
Gotta get back up, you a Black Panther’s son
I gotta tell you that you'll die slow, die slow, die slow

So, ahem

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
She caught me creepin' with my old ho
She ran up like ""yeah, yeah,"" I was like ""no, no""
My lookout man was my right hand but he was wrong, though
Then I seen some diamonds come off of my neighbor's porch
And it was her, she had a Louis Vuitton purse clean as detergent
She had the same exact face as my brother's nurse
And he in a hearse, I never looked at it for what it's worth

[Chorus: Young Thug & Rich Homie Quan]
So I never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never made love (Never made)
Never made love, never made love
Never made love, never ever ever ever made love
Never made love, never made love
I ain't never made love (Ayy)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Never made love, never made love (Ayy)
When she open up, I'ma taste her (Try)
X out everyone and then erase her (Ayy)
I'm sorry for lyin' to your face, yeah (Sorry)
I'ma marry her and I bouquet her (Ayy)
Leavin' out the house drunk and she stumbles (Woah)
Be all on her mind, she can't even think of (Drunk)

They don't even know what the fuck love means, ayy (They gon' fuck with me)
She say she never waste time on me (Ahh)
Yeah that came out of your jaws, baby (I heard it)

Lockin' up like handcuffs
Give me all your time, every day (Woo)
Girl how come we never made love at your spot? (Why?)
Cause you ain't want your other rich homie be findin' out (Ayy)

They trip out all the time, tellin' you I'm on some bullshit
Parallel parkin' that pussy, they like my motion (Skrrt)
Put that on my mama, now Stunna know that I'm loaded (Loaded)
When my partner see it he stand up like he on Folgers (Woo)
I ain't like that shit so I hit him right in his shit
Then I told him, ""Don't ever do that shit there again"" (What?)
How you feel if I see your ho and fuck on the kid? (What?)
I'ma catch a body if she leave me, I'm not playin'
Yes, I said I'm the best and I put that on the red
When you make me mad I tried to get back and get some head
And I know that's wrong, but my dumbass still did it instead
Then I put the strap to my own head like boy I'm on one, woah
Then I told her don't ever do it again (Uh huh)
Every guy you look at, I'll turn him to wind (Ayy)
Yeah, then I looked up at God like yeah

Big old cross like a pastor, pop that pussy like a Snapple
Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins?
Body red like an apple
Screaming free my brothers, I still sleep with my mother
Last week I made a quarter, plus I still respect others
I can't believe it's not butter, that little bitch might be my supper
I get respect from her brother, Crenshaw boolin', Nipsey Hussle
Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we gon' wrestle
Chanel pouch on my left, fuck the cops we don't play
Benjamins, Grants talk back, I be like ""who is that?""
They be like ""where you at?"", meet at the Valet at Saks

She wanna drop it if she can, if she can baby
She wanna rock it with her hand, yeah a marriage

Until we meet each other, oh
I want you to love me forever
Love me forever

She love my life and she don't care
I flood my bitch and I don't care what they say about it
You just a diamond in the mine and you dirty
I like my bitches brown like James, no Worthy
Scratched out the alphabet, 'cept B bitch

Bring them racks out the safe
Go to church like Mase
Put a mask on my face
Beat the case in my case any day

She fuckin' all my buddies
I might love fuckin' it, but I just cannot love it
I might catch a nigga bitch and fuck her right on Gresham
Bitch, I am a monster, I know I am a lil' ugly

Got a unique body, my clothes, get 'em from Russia
I might pull up and pimp that bitch just like a sucka
I don't give no fuck about these lil' shrimps, I got my mustard, ketchup, nigga
Nigga loaded pimpin', pimp tight, game right
I might eat it, I might beat it like Mike Ikes
Treat that pussy Tempur-Pedic and call it a night
She compliment on my fly and ain't talking no flight
And therefore I love her
She make a nigga shine without using butter
My partner in crime, she won't tell like her mother
We don't want no one other, we got one another
She know I got her, we got each other
She know I'ma grip her weave when I fuck her
She know I'ma go over C's like a Blood
Hey, baby, my name Jeff and Mudd

As I take off like a missile, ayy
These niggas mugging when they see us
So I clutch on all my pistols
Plus I come through smoking loud like a whistle
Looking down from the cloud in my rearview
These pussy niggas want a slice like Kimbo
And I freeze them all, Sub Zero
Dynasty, Dynasty
These bitches climb on me, climb on me
That's mine, I want the whole ninety Gs
All my niggas feasting, yes, dining please
I put on my ice and they liking this
Fuck her fast, nitrogen, nitrogen
Roar, bitch, Lion King, Lion King
I got more water than Tennessee
Then I take it off and pour it on her like a coach
Playing with my money bitch you fired, you a roach
Straight up in that vintage, it's just Chanel, no Coach
Put the little bitch in time out, no spoke
Why the fuck a nigga rolling my weed and leave it open?
And I'm cooking all white, nigga, no portions

I cannot be worried 'bout no bitch
'Cause I know a bitch could be somewhere sucking a dick, ayy
