I don't see how you can hate from outside of the club
You can't even get in!
Hahaha
Leggo

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in ten years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said ""On my dick""
I ain't really mean to say ""On my dick""
But since we're talkin' about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done
[Interlude: Busta Rhymes]
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Let's go!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day (Go)
See, they really really wanna pop me (Blow)
Just know that you will never flop me (Oh)
And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref'
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doin' this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go!)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it (Have it)
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
Fresher than a muh'fucka

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit
No, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with an elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said ""shoot 'em"", and I said ""okay""
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, ""¡Olé!""
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
(Nope) Not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild
Been here for a while, I was like, ""Fuck trial""
I puts it down, I'm so Young Money
If you got eyes, look at me now, bitch!
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Look at me now, look at me now (Haha! Oh)
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now (Haha! Oh), look at me now (Yeah)
I'm fresher than a muh'fucka

When we're moving at the speed of sound
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?

Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice

If she a bad bitch, let's get to it, right away
We up in this club
Bring me the bottles
I know, girl, that you came in this bitch with your man
That's a no-no, girl
All this money in the air, I wanna see you dance

But I don't fuck with broke bitches (Girl, it's you)

I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em (Haaan!)
LVs, Hermes, Dolces
Them hoes, ain't loyal, man, they rotate
School me to the game, now I know my duty
Put her in the Lotus
She was ridin' in that hoopty (Whoop!)
Fuck that bitch, I got my own ho
Fuck your weed, I got my own smoke
Had to put my mink back on
Tell that bitch, put her ring back on

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Come on, come on, girl, why you frontin'?
Baby, show me something
When I call her, she gon' leave

And it's all for nothing (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, let me see)

You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I’m not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby
[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there
Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté
You used to be

[Verse 1: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture (Oh, oh, oh)
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Yeah, yeah)
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah (Woah, woah)
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout
[Verse 5: Fabolous]
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better

[Interlude: Chris Brown & Drake]
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!

[Verse 7: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame (Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself
[Verse 8: Andre 3000]
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)

If I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink]
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me
[Chorus: Justin Bieber, with Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

[Verse 3: Chris Brown, with Ink]
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Ink, Ink]
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try

You should just come on the bed, I should just fuck you right now
Oh just forget what I said, I just be thinkin' out loud
Thinkin' out loud, thinkin' out loud

My neck is retarded, but nigga, I'm geeked
My bitch is a baller, but she from the streets
So don't get her started

Ferragamo's on me, got me flexin' on 'em

Diamonds shinin', that's them VVS's on me
Leanin' off Activis (Ah)
Tippin' on fours, thinkin' 'bout when them hoes used to sleep on me like mattresses (Mattresses)
But that's how it go, now I'm gettin' that dough, and I'm 'bout to count up like it's calculus (Calculus)

I wasn't born last night
I know these hoes ain't right
But you was blowin' up her phone last night
But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, ooh
Nigga, that's that nerve
Why give a bitch your heart when she rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch an inch when she rather have nine?
You know how the game goes
She be mine by half time, I'm the shit, ooh
Nigga, that's that nerve
You all about her, and she all about hers
Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everything but trust these hoes
(CB fuck with me!)

Took a broke nigga's bitch
I can make a broke bitch rich
But I don't fuck with broke bitches
Got a white girl with some fake titties
I took her to the Bay with me

I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? (It's been said before)
Or what about her style? (Too obvious)
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say

I don't know your name but excuse me miss (Oh yeah)
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention

Faire l'amour lendemain

What if the sky was turning red?
I know we'd be safe right here in my bed, laying face to face
Oh girl, I love the way you sound when you rain on me
So tonight let's act it out, and show you how it's gon' be
I'm gon' kiss your other set of lips
Hold your body by your legs and hips

You're telling me to go deeper, go deeper
I feel your knees getting weaker and weaker
We can go longer if you just lay down, lay down, down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
All these vibrations from your legs, massaging my back
I got your body shivering 'cause we're covered in sweat
And girl, I like the way it opens up when you throw it back, baby
Girl, it might be too much, oh baby, if you keep doing that
I got that pillow for your knees right here
Baby, can you make it disappear?
Your voice is the last thing I'm gonna hear
Then I wanna make you holler

Won't you come on over
And we can treat it like it's the motherfuckin'

End of the world? (Woo!)

Where the real friends at when you really need 'em?
When I was locked up in the county, I ain't even see 'em
All by my lonely, lonely
What happen to the bitches and the party?
A hundred bottles, that was every weekend
Bitches piled up in my crib like a coliseum
After 3 A.M., you know we gettin' freaky
Hella one-night stands, bitches catchin' feelings
Tired of fake lovin'
Fake Hollywood, ain't 'bout shit
Fake gang bangin' and claimin' to pop shit
Fake titties and cocaine in they nostrils, stop it (Hah)

Beyond imagination

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Say she coming over late night with some bad bitches
Told her, ""Baby have your whole team ready""
I done got so high on the Miley Cyrus
I just need some codeine just to relax
This the new Vivian Millennium, wavy
We don't talk as much as we used to, lately
Send a text through forever, my lady
You done kept it true from the day that you met me
I don't want to get you to ruin your new relations
Showin' tough love, baby, how the streets made me

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Bye bye, baby, goin' bye bye
Had her on the sidelines, now she goin' bye bye
Used to come through, hit it, pull off like a drive-by
Then she got that pool on her so I know her new guy
Nigga had to tie the knot, know that nigga tied the knot
I just had her put up in a penthouse like a jackpot
Same young niggas servin' junkies out the crack spot
Take some well known pussy, eat it 'til she pass out
Take the stripper, smoke some Keisha with her, then crash out
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Still a doughboy so I'm walkin' with the bands out
Take the Dom Pérignon, told 'em gon' carry on
Keep the shit a trillion, and I wanna take the time to get to know you like I should've did my last one
For my new one, for my new one, for my new jump, baby gon'

Shawty comin' over late night with some bad bitches
Told baby, ""Have the whole team ready""
Balled so hard last night
Baby called back, say she wanna have another replay
You enjoyed the moment as you should've, spit your game
On the thing, man I should've, started hangin' 'round the gang
She the truest
Put her hands out and bomb, she the truest
Make me pull up with the funds, I'll do it
Support you once, and again I'll do it
You want that brand new Benz, I'll do it
You ain't ever got the time, what you doin'?
You ain't ever did complain when we do it
Now you actin' real strange when we do it
Want your girls on girls when we did it
You ain't ever put the world in our business
You see me, fall in love, I'm the realest
You see me give the game to you, had to read about it on the blogs
Accepted me like a jail call, baby gon'

In the morning look at her face 'cause I don't fuck with makeup
And you know I love you
No matter, I'm right here waiting for you
It ain't 'bout the money, it ain't about the fame
It ain't 'bout the chase and it ain't about the games

Ooh, I love your name, I hope you feel the same

AK by the waist, no I do not play
Get familiar with the money, déjà vu every day

Yeah, it's how I feel, right
It's only me right
Ha, it's life, ha

[Verse]
I was 15, a Virginia nigga with ambition
Young but I envisioned fuckin' 'em bad bitches
Live my life with no regrets, I try to show respect but you don't give it
I guess you don't understand winnin'
It might take me a lifetime to take it back
And it might take you a lifetime to know the facts
Yeah, just 'cause we different, don't mean we distant
And if you kill a man, ain't no way to bring him back
Yeah, they say it's mind over matter
But what we livin' for? What really matters?
Some niggas silver spoon just on a platter
And other niggas is doomed just for disaster
All alone sleepin' in my bedroom
As I wet the sheets, momma gon' be dead soon
'Cause a man beat her, but he don't realize
She important to this family like a fuckin' heirloom
Yeah, a nigga still found his way out
A record deal came, that nigga played out
My momma livin' good, she takin' days out
They sayin', ""Boy, all that hard work paid off""
500 racks for an hour show
But ain't gon' ever do no 60-minute interview
'Cause all you wanna do is twist my words up
And all I wanna do is flip my birds up
Kinda tipsy off that red rum, murder
I'm a singin' ass nigga, know you heard of me
Every day my clique stuntin'
Niggas talkin' down but I'ma make them pick they words up
I done said all I had to say, what else?
Cock suckers low blowin' under my belt
Yeah, they hangin' from the tip, they tryna get a sip
Don't let them get a grip, I'm pissin' on them myself
19 a nigga went through a tragedy
Three years a nigga just found a better me
Yeah, you might find another lover
But you always started with Breezy like the letter ""B""
Nightmares feelin' haunted
Thinkin' do I really like this star shit?
Huh, because fame ain't freedom
And this diamond chain only mean they hold you hostage
Now I got a lot of offers
Tellin' me to wear their clothes and they wanna be my sponsor
But when a nigga fall off again, they be like, ""Off him""
And then they gonna smile up in your face just like, ""Awesome, great""
Wait, police and a thug cannot relate
I guess that's why this war on drugs is the debate
So I'ma keep on livin' my life from day to day
Learn from my mistakes6Embed"

To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I could play with
Huh, aight, let me see, let me see what I got

[Verse]
Okay, I be bangin' all on that beat
808, she got the bass when her booty shake
She got her friends with her and they a sight to see
All that butt, don't let it go to waste
All this Hennessy, the liquor, 'bout to penetrate
While I'm pushin' Lamborghini's on the interstate
I long-stroke her, I'ma go for hours
You minute-made like lemonade
I'm fresh as hell in these Margielas
As I skate pass, better than veterans
Bipolar cold, give me the medicine
My chain too bright, no Thomas Edison
When I pull it out, chick nervous
Better ride this wave, chick, surf it
Girl, you better keep them legs open
Only thing you close is these curtains
Ha, and she only got time for a brother if I take her out to eat
A brother really gotta motivate
Man, that's too much work for the kitty, I don't work for the kitty
Really don't communicate
Ha, I'd rather lick it like a dinner plate
I'd rather keep my money in a safe
Man, I ain't got time to play
I need it now, not a minute late
Now she blowin' up my line on the cellular
She wanna lock a brother down, on the regular
Talkin' crazy to me like she own it
But I don't trust her as far as I can throw her
Huh, momma told me to find a keeper
But I switch like designer sneakers
A girl with the finest features
Every brother wanna talk to her, but I got her first, finders keepers
Violins in the back, is my theme music
Her booty on my mind, I dream booty
Any __ wanna ___ my ___
Then it's off with his head, how kings do it
My ring's ruby
Red bandana, I stay woopin'
Got too many cribs, I stay movin'
Three Lambos, I stay coupin'
Yeah, but you don't hear me though
Virginia to the Westside
My car foreign, the girl sit on the left side
I smokin' weed on the plane, that's the best high
She gotta sign the waiver 'fore I let her fly
Huh, it's helipads on the boat
Chillin' in the South of France, Saint-Tropez, Nice, Monaco
But nothin' compare to what's in my pants, girl, stop playin'31Embed"

Made my mistakes, but I love my kid, oh

Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one

Break me down and build me up
Wish that I could meet you halfway
But I don't have the heart
Ooh, ooh, don't have the heart
Oh, yeah, oh

Yeah, I gave you that and more
Yeah, but when it came to trust
We both fucked up
Talkin' 'bout, ""I saw you with your side ho""
I was looking for someone to ride for
The ring and the promise I gave you was only a milestone
Now we both wakin' up lookin' for missed calls and dial tones
And I'm sick of dreamin' 'bout you (Woah)

Her eyes look like mine
Now I'm forced to pick sides

Yikes!
Haha, where we at with it?
Help me out
Haha
Bounce
Yeah
Like some poor juices, ain't you been good with that?
Hahaha

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Eyes must be wide shut
Liquor got you open, closin' your blinders
Just in case you need a friendly reminder
Let me take this bullet, bullet out my head (Ow!)
Change your body, need advisor
Car too big, but fuck it, don't need a driver (Nah)
All me want is a girl who be a rider (Yeah)
Can't believe she pull it, pull it
Nigga gun, gun pow

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But she want me to hold her, hold her down (Haha)
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now (No love, no love)
Must be cuckoo, got me fucked up (Haha), fucked up, wow (Got me fucked up)
You know a nigga ain't gon' hold ya, hold ya down
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a mirage
Ha, fuck I look like?
I'm a mirage (Haha), haha
What the fuck I look like? (Yikes!)
It's all in your mind, your mind
Fuck I look like?
Open your eyes, you're blind
What the fuck I look like?

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah, girl, your mind should apologize to ya
Keep on tellin' all of those crazy lies to ya
You believe 'em all, don't wanna accept the truth
Who the fuck you kiddin', kiddin', what's the use?
Sad to see you playin' the fool
You don't know half the shit that a nigga been through
I guess you got your reward, reward for it (Ha, yeah)
You actin' like you don't need me, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
But she want me to hold her, hold her down (Got me fucked up, babe)
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now (Hahaha, yeah)
Must be cuckoo, got me fucked up, fucked up, wow (Babe, bravado)
You know a nigga ain't gon' hold ya, hold ya down
Haha, excuse my French, but (Ha)
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm a mirage
Ha, fuck I look like? (You can't see me)
I'm a mirage (Haha, look)
What the fuck I look like?
It's all in your mind, your mind (What?)
Fuck I look like?
Open your eyes, you're blind (You got me fucked up)
What the fuck I look like?

[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, you lookin' for love, and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rappin'
My body wrapped in some Valentino, Loro Piana fashion
Sex with passion, romancin', laughin'
Happiness, action, restaurants, relaxin'
They got some good sushi in Aspen, that good pussy I'm smashin'
I call you Matsuhisa, yeah, I'm your Visa
American Express, I must confess
I'm tryna go beyond love and this is hard to translate
Love is good, but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top, but you don't got what it take
To be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star, you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn, I used to miss ya, uh
I used to love ya, I fiend to hold ya
You didn't know me, it was only just a mirage
[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
A mirage (Mirage)
(Uh, you didn't know me, it was just a mirage)
Ha, fuck I look like?
(Just a mirage)
I'm a mirage
(Mirage, you know Nas)
What the fuck I look like? (Yeah)
It's all in your mind, your mind
Fuck I look like?
Open your eyes, you're blind (Do it, baby)
What the fuck I look like? (Yeah)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Right
What the fuck I look like?
Fucked up
What the fuck I look like?20Embed"
