Taking my sulkin' to the masses

Seeing the beauty through the...

Building my rain up in the cloud

I was uptight, wanna let loose

While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?

Now I'm smiling from the stage

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos

Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

Looking for the path of the young and lonely

Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel

Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely

[Verse 1]
Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life

[Chorus]
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said—
[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'm playin' the role, ridin' the bull, stuck in a hole
Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun?
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life, oh-oh

[Chorus]
Oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)
I said oh, love (Sometimes, I can get a little)
Have mercy (I can get a little lonely)
On me (Sometimes, I can get a little)
And keep me company (I can get a little lonely)

[Bridge]
I said, ""Oh, love"" (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
Have mercy (Help keep me company, I said, oh, love)
Oh, love, can you please have mercy on me? (Keep me company, I said, help keep me company, I said)
Can you keep me company? (Help keep me company, I said, help)

Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life?
Inside, I'm a mess, but I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on, but you'd never know
I smile all day, and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my
Life is fleeting

A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind

A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someonе please save my lifе?
I'm crying for help, it's such a cliché
Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save

Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse

Asking why I'm here instead of home

Saw you there, and I thought

You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Eh, eh

New money, suit and tie
I could read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
Dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make a bad guy good for a weekend

So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4 (Blank Space)]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she? ""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darlin', I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see

Because your eyes they burn so bright
I'm all you've got, when you say that you want it all
You want it all

[Chorus]
All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me5Embed"

Emma stood in front of me
Telling me what I'm supposed to be
Jackie loves to run and hide
Give her love, and she will die
Golly me, oh my, oh my
Cross my heart and hope to die
Bourbon streets and bicycles
Holding you in carnivals

[Chorus]
Baby, is my love too old for you?
Baby, is my love too old for you?
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you

[Verse 2]
Dinner bells and loaded gun
Innocence is bound to run
Enemies and playing fun
But don't you touch that golden sun
Innocence and sentiment
It's all I have, it's paying rent

[Chorus]
Baby, is my love too old for you?
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you
[Bridge]
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence

One, two, yeah
A one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
I'm broke but I'm happy
I'm poor but I'm kind
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high but I'm grounded
I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby

[Chorus 1]
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's going to be fine, fine, fine
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a high five

[Verse 2]
I feel drunk but I'm sober
I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm tired but I'm working, yeah
I care but I'm restless
I'm here but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby
[Chorus 2]
And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's going to be quite alright
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is flicking a cigarette

[Chorus 3]
And what it all comes down to
Is that I haven't got it all figured out just yet
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving the peace sign

[Verse 3]
I'm free but I'm focused
I'm green but I'm wise
I'm hard but I'm friendly, baby
I'm sad but I'm laughing
I'm brave but I'm chicken shit
I'm sick but I'm pretty, baby

[Chorus 4]
And what it all boils down to
Is that no one's really got it figured out just yet
Well I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is playing a piano
And what it all comes down to my dear friends, yeah
Is that everything is just fine fine fine
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is hailing a taxi cab2Embed"

Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right

[Pre-Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again

[Verse 2: Elisa]
Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights, I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'
[Pre-Chorus: Elisa & Dan Reynolds]
Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

When the moon is lookin' down
Shinin' light upon your ground
I'm flyin' up to let you see
That the shadow cast is me

Take me on a whim
It's not the sun that provides us
It's not the moon that divides us
I can barely swim
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again

[Pre-Chorus]
Stand up when you hear your name
Because I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole, but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

[Chorus]
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
[Verse 2]
I've been painted gin
It's not the color I came in
It's not the shirt that I stain in
Hang me on a limb
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again

[Pre-Chorus]
Stand up when you hear your name
'Cause I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

[Chorus]
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground

Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up, I won't be satisfied
Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up, I won't be satisfied
Stop right there I've got a hole inside my chest
Until it fills up...

[Chorus]
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over

Step out into the sun
It's time to take it over
And look how far we've come
