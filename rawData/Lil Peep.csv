Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces
[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason1.4KEmbed"

Where did all the lines go?

Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed

While you were away from me

Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle

Tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
[Verse 3]
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room

Every fuckin' kind of abuse
If you love me too
You would give me you (Give me you)
Lock me in your room
Don't tell me the truth
Everything you said (Everything you said)
Stays inside my head (Stays inside my head)
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled

Sometimes life gets fucked up (Fucked up)

I love you to the summer and back, it's not the winter

Is kinda creepy, but fuck it, she orders and I deliver
I could never leave you alone, my little mama

Wherever you are is my home, you know I mean it
They say home is where the heart is, you're the reason mine is beatin'

I will always be here for you, and when I'm dyin'
I pray to a higher power, next to you is where I'm lyin'
Would you fuck me right on the floor? I'm feelin' naughty
I wish to explore your features, secrets hidden in your body
I been feelin' like I don't have a choice, my only option
Watchin' me through the window as I whip up this concoction
Don't you ever take your life out of mine, I'll fuckin' kill you
Take you out to the bayou in the cabin with the mildew
And I'll leave you there for someone to find, my little angel
In your deepest darkest corners and I'm lovin' every angle
Baby, you got nowhere to hide, I'm comin' for you
Your parents could never fathom the levels to I adore you
It's like Palestine up inside my mind, a deadly war zone
Quakin' inside my boots as you waken my every hormone
I'll give you everything I've got till I'm gone, and that's a promise
Unless you didn't want it, then for you I'd be dishonest

Wish that you could help me understand
Why? 'Cause I don't know (I don't know, I don't know)
Sometimes I feel that weight, I hold that in my chest
Sometimes I hold it back, other times I'm blessed
Other times I want more, you put me in debt
I want you like Zoloft
Wanna be like so inside, wanna be like
For me want you to be more into it than this
For me I want more than you seem to wanna give
I see passion in the way you turn your back
Money and the ice, I put upon your wrist
There's a silhouette inside, a lucid dream
I project myself on you, then back to me
There's a reason that she doesn't call me back
It is the way, it is the way it really seems
There's a vision of an altar now, me and the one
Some passin' on and out

You'll only see us in the back
GothBoiClique, all black
I knew love once, it's hard to forget
I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me
And I miss 2013 love songs
And I'm so lost, under club lights
In the all black, GothBoiClique

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs
Everybody know I numb it with the drugs

[Verse 2: WICCA PHASE SPRINGS ETERNAL & DØVES]
Fucked up in the back of the club
Cast a sigil in the back of the club
I got scars on me, no love
Light a candle and I pray for Døves
And you're fadin' away, like the pill under my tongue
We seriously never even touched, it sucks
I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood
It's so fucked
So tell me what is love
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
Did I really want it?
And why can't I remember?
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
It's a slow drug
And I swear that
But it's true love
These are true lines
[Verse 3: DØVES]
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed (Tryin' so hard)
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing
Hollow shell, quiet hell, but you're so into me
Screamin', ""Why don't you love me back?!""
'Cause it's GothBoiClique, 'til my lungs collapse

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, baby, I be makin' noise
GothBoi, I'm the one you can't avoid
No choice, no choice
Lookin' for you in the back of the club
Lookin' for her in the back of the club, fucked up

Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful

[Verse 2]
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
[Verse 3]
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room33Embed"

[Verse 2: Ghostemane]
I am so sick of talking, I'd rather be showin ya
To the bottom of the ocean and tie you up in a sunken boat
And now I am a schema, I scheme with Peep in the Beamer
Then crash it into a tree with you in the trunk then I flee the scene

[Verse 3: Kold-Blooded]
So watch da Hidden Characters
Tearing through any barrier
You can feel the aura
Engulfing your whole exterior
Inferior, period
Tell me, Why you so serious?
When Kold Akuma unleashes
Clear out the whole damn area
Once the Posse strikes fear in ya
Never will you hear from them
Try and deny it
Defiance
Only option reasonable
Leavin' em all bleeding
All-season
Deed is always feasible
Contagious diseases
You been infected by da SchemaBoys
Part Three

[Verse 1: OmenXIII]
You a fuck boy swerve, bitch I'm finna murder
Leave your name in the dirt and your ashes in the urn
OmenXIII leave you hurt, black-painted nails, with a all black shirt
You think you up next, I don't rest, I'm the best, no contest bitch better wait your turn

[Verse 2: Brennan Savage]
Pull up with my brothers you know that's a fact
Man we don't know how to act
All in this bitch and we making a pact
Eliminate anyone else walking up in our path
Talking that shit behind all of our backs
Sipping 'tusson and calling it an act
I'm the man in the mirror looking back
Wasn't no one now I'm on the track

[Chorus: Ghostemane & Brennan Savage]
I don't wanna count sheep no more
I don't wanna lose sleep no more
Only thing that I need is a little bit of cognac
I don't wanna hate no more
I don't wanna count sheep no more
I don't wanna lose sleep no more
Only thing that I need is a little bit of cognac
I don't wanna hate no more
