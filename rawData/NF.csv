Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I guess I'm a disappointment, doin' everything I can
I don't wanna make you disappointed, it's annoying
I just wanna make you feel like everything I ever do
Was never tryna make an issue for you, but I guess the more you
Thought about everything you were never even wrong
In the first place, right? Yeah, I'ma just ignore you
Walking towards you with my head down
Lookin' at the ground, I'm embarrassed for you
Paranoia, what did I do wrong this time?
That's parents for you
Very loyal? Shoulda had my back
But you put a knife in it—my hands are full
What else should I carry for you?
I cared for you, but…
[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you don't wanna make this work
You just wanna make this worse
Want me to listen to you, but you don't ever hear my words
You don't wanna know my hurt, yeah
Let me guess, you want an apology, probably
How can we keep going at a rate like this?
We can't, so I guess I'ma have to leave
Please, don't come after me
I just wanna be alone right now, I don't really wanna think at all
Go ahead, just drink it off
Both know you're gonna call tomorrow like nothing's wrong
Ain't that what you always do?
I feel like every time I talk to you, you're in an awful mood
What else can I offer you?
There's nothing left right now, I gave it all to you
[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Le-le-let you down

[Verse 3]
Yeah, don't talk down to me
That's not gonna work now
Packed all my clothes and I moved out
I don't even wanna go to your house
Every time I sit on that couch
I feel like you lecture me, eventually, I bet that we
Coulda made this work
And prolly woulda figured things out
But I guess I'm a letdown
But it's cool, I checked out
Oh, you wanna be friends now?
Okay, let's put my fake face on and pretend now
Sit around and talk about the good times that didn't even happen
I mean, why are you laughing?
Must have missed that joke, let me see if I can find a reaction
No, but at least you're happy
[Chorus]
Feels like we're on the edge right now
I wish that I could say I'm proud
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, I let you down
All these voices in my head get loud
And I wish that I could shut them out
I'm sorry that I let you down
Oh, let you down

I'm so sorry now

""Hey, Nate, how's life?""
I don’t know, it's alright
I've been dealin’ with some things like every human being
And really didn't sleep much last night (Last night)
""I'm sorry,"" that's fine
I just think I need a little me time
I just think I need a little free time
Little break from the shows and the bus rides, yeah (Bus rides)
Last year I had a breakdown
Thoughts tellin' me I'm lost gettin' too loud
Had to see a therapist, then I found out
Somethin' funny’s goin’ on up in my house
Yeah, I started thinkin' maybe I should move out
You know, pack my cart, take a new route
Clean up my yard, get the noose out
Hang up my heart, let it air out (Air out)
I’ve been searchin'
""What does that mean, Nate?"" I've been learning
Grabbin' my keepsakes, leavin’ my burdens
Well, I brought a few with me, I'm not perfect
Lookin' at the view, like this concerns me
Pickin' up the cues, right? I'm quite nervous
Hate it when I lose sight, life gets blurry
And things might hurt me
It's prolly gonna be a long journey, but hey (But hey)
It's worth it, though
Cold world out there, kids, grab your coats
It's been a minute, I know, now I'm back to roam
Lookin' for the antidote to crack the code
Pretty vivid; I admit it, I'm in classic mode
Don't need pity given to me, but I can't condone
Talkin' down to me, I'ma have to crack your nose for crackin' jokes
I'm lookin' for the map to hope, you seen it? (You seen it?)
Been makin' a whole lot of changes
Wrote a song about that, you should play it
I get scared when I walk on these stages
I look at the crowd and see so many faces, yeah
That's when I start to get anxious
That's when my thoughts can be dangerous
That's when I put on my makeup and drown in self-hatred
Forget what I'm sayin', and—
Where'd the beat go?
Oh, ain't that somethin'?
Drums came in, you ain't see that comin'
Hands on my head, can't tell me nothin'
Got a taste of the fame, had to pump my stomach
Throw it back up like I don't want it
Wipe my face, clean off my vomit
OCD, tryna push my buttons
I said don't touch it, now y'all done it
I can be critical, never typical
Intricate with every syllable, I'm a criminal
Intimate, but never political, pretty visual
Even if you hate it, I'll make it feel like you're in it, though
You call me what you wanna, but never call me forgettable
Leave you deep in thought, I could never swim in the kiddie pool
Way that I been thinkin' is cinematic, it's beautiful
Man, I don't know if I'm makin' movies or music videos (Videos, videos, videos)
Yeah, the sales can rise
Doesn't mean much though when your health declines
See, we've all got somethin' that we trapped inside
That we try to suffocate, you know, hopin' it dies
Try to hold it underwater but it always survives
Then it comes up outta nowhere like an evil surprise
Then it hovers over you to tell you millions of lies
You don't relate to that? Must not be as crazy as I am
The point I'm makin' is the mind is a powerful place
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way
It's pretty cool, right? Yeah, but it's not always safe
Just hang with me, this'll only take a moment, okay?
Just think about it for a second, if you look at your face
Every day when you get up and think you'll never be great
You'll never be great—not because you're not, but the hate
Will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith, woo
I've been developin', take a look at the benefits
Nothin' to meddle with, I can never be delicate
Am I even relevant? That depends how you measure it
Take a measurement, then bag it up and give me the evidence
Pretty evident; dependable can never be tentative
I'm a gentleman, depending on if I think you're genuine
Pretty elegant, but not afraid to tell you to get a grip
Proper etiquette, I keep it to myself when I celebrate, ah (Ah)
It's that time again
Better grab your balloons and invite your friends
Seatbelts back on, yeah, strap 'em in
Look at me, everybody, I'm smilin' big
On a road right now that I can't predict
Tell me ""Tone that down,"" but I can't resist
Y'all know that sound, better raise your fist

Yeah, when I grow up, you know what I wanna be?
Take a seat, let me tell you my ridiculous dreams
I wanna rap, yeah, I know it's hard to believe
And I can tell you're already thinkin' I will never succeed
But I'm okay with it, I admit the lyrics are weak
I've been workin' on 'em, I'll be good eventually
I understand you gotta crawl before you get to your feet
But I been running for a while, they ain't ready for me, ahh
I know this prolly isn't really realistic
And honestly, I might not ever make a difference
But that don't make a difference, I'ma have to risk it
I've been crunchin' numbers, you ain't gotta be a mathematician
To see the odds ain't rootin' for me
I can't lie though, it's kinda how I like it to be
The underdog, yeah, you prolly think you know what I mean
But what I'm saying is they ever push me, I'm gonna swing, yeah
I could go to college, get in debt like everybody else
Graduate and prolly get a job that doesn't pay the bills
That don't make a lot of sense to me, forget the Happy Meals
I don't like the dollar menu, I would rather make a meal
Huh? Make a mil'? Nah, I said make a meal
Home-cookin', get the grill, how you want it? Pretty well?
Everything I see is overdone to me, I'm not Adele
But I'ma get a record deal and say hello to mass appeal
[Chorus]
When I grow up, I just want to pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just want to make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)
I just want to sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, ayy
When I grow up
Yeah, yeah, ayy

[Verse 2]
I'ma make 'em notice me, rhymin' like it's poetry
Everything I oversee, I just like to overthink
Mockin' me, you pay the fee, no return and no receipts
Those of you that don't believe, quiet, you don't know a thing
Quiet when I'm tryna sing, quiet when I'm making beats
Quiet when I'm tryna think, sorry, I don't mean to scream
I just feel like no one really gets me and it's sad to see
'Cause someday I'ma grow up and show all of you it's meant to be (Yeah)
Anybody wanna hear me rap? ""No""
Come on, let me play a couple tracks, ""No""
Come on, I can spit it really fast, ""No""
You think I should throw this in the trash? ""No""
Tricked ya; haters, go away before I hit ya
I am not a beggar or a kiss-up
You don't understand? Well, I forgive ya
I am not a quitter, you ain't really think that, did ya?
Maybe someday I could even be up on the radio
Have a tour bus and maybe even play a couple shows
Everybody in the crowd singing every word I wrote
Tellin' me that I am not the only one that feels alone
Huh? You feel alone? Yeah, I kinda feel alone
Wonder if that feelin' ever goes away when you get old
Will I ever make it as an artist? I don't really know
Might not make a lot of dough
I'ma have to try it, though
[Chorus]
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
I just wanna make a couple mil'
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah)

I just wanna sign a record deal
Maybe buy a house up in the hills (Okay, oh, yeah)
Might not be the best in my field (Ayy, ayy, yeah)
But I guarantee that I'ma die real
When I grow up
I just wanna pay my bills (Woo)
Rappin' about the way I feel (Oh, yeah)
(Yeah, the way I feel)
Yeah, I just wanna make a couple mil' (Ayy, couple mil')
Leave it to the fam in the will (Oh, yeah, to the fam in the will)

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I heard you said I ain't the type for you
I don't regret it though, I learned from it
They should have you locked up for all the time you stole from us (Woo)
Took you out when I had no money
Only person that you ever cared about was you, that's why it's so funny
You want somebody that'll keep you warm at night
Then, tell me, why you actin' cold to me?
You ain't the only one to blame, no, I'm the one that made you rich
When I bought every lie you sold to me
Yeah, heard you threw away the pictures
But you still got the memories of us
So I guess that don't really make a difference
Flippin' through 'em in your head
Got you textin' me all hours of the night
Yeah, you told me that you needed distance
What's the deal with you?
You say you want a man that keeps it real
Then why you mad when I get real with you?
You want someone to pay the bills for you
Went from failin' you, now I feel for you, liar

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?
You say all I ever do is just control your life
But how you gonna lie like that?
How you gonna lie like that?

[Verse 2]
Look, let me guess, you want to stay friends?
Tellin' people that's how we been?
Tellin' everybody, yeah, that we was barely speakin'
Ah, that's kinda funny, why'd you call me every day then?
It's immaturity, you goin' off the deep end
You just want somebody you can chill and get some drinks with, cool
Then don't hit me on the weekend
Tellin' me you missed the way we talked and how I listen, yeah
Why you playin' with my mind, huh?
Why you playin' with my time, huh?
Told me, ""We should let it go and put it all behind us""
That's what I did, now you askin' me what I done, I was
Waitin' for this day, I saw it comin'
I think you just like attention, tryna tell me all your problems
I got issues of my own, I ain't got time for all this drama
You told me that you don't really wanna talk—then why you callin', huh?

I heard you told your friends that I'm just not your type
If that's how you really feel, then why'd you call last night?

Clicks, clicks, clicks, they'll do anything to get a few
Tick, tick, tick, that's the sound before my head explodes
Quit, quit, quit, look at you up on your pedestals
Quick, quick, quick, here the critics come, it's time to go
I read your article, it kinda hurt me
I don't know who hired you or what your friends say in your circle
But the fact that you released it tells me two things are for certain
They get paid for trashin' people, I get paid 'cause I stay workin' (Yeah)
Dropped The Search and they emerge up outta nowhere to the surface
Just to peek behind the curtain, throwin' salt at all my burdens
I'm aware I shouldn't give this my attention, life's a journey
I should just stay on my path and learn to laugh, you think they heard me?
Ears are burning, put 'em out, quiet, quiet, look around
Why don't they find someone way more interesting to write about?
Us, we're kinda boring, aren't we? All we do is whine and pout
It's confusing, so amusing how I argue with myself
Hello
I spit it with ease, so leave it to me
You doubt it, but you better believe
I'm on a rampage, hit 'em with the record release
Depend on the week, I'm prolly gonna have to achieve
Another goal, let me go when I'm over the beat
I go into beast mode, like I'm ready to feast
I'm fed up with these thieves, tryna get me to bleed
They wanna see me take an L, yep, see what I mean?
How many records I gotta give you to get with the program?
Taken for granted, I'm 'bout to give you the whole plan
Open your mind up and take a look at the blueprint
Debate if you gotta, but gotta hold it with both hands
To pick up the bars, you gotta be smart
You really gotta dig in your heart
If you wanna get to the root of an issue
Pursuin' the mental can be dark and be difficult
But the pay off at the end of it can help you to get through it, ayy
[Chorus]
Paid my dues, made it through (Woo, woo, woo)
Spread the news, I'm on the loose (Woo, woo, woo)
Makin' moves, I need some room (Woo, woo, woo)
Thought we's cool, well, don't assume, don't assume, ayy
I'm the truth, oh, they want some proof? Here, don't be rude
Somethin' new, even when I lose, I make it look cool
Do the show, then we hit the room, wife is lookin', oh
What to do? I don't need the shades up to like the view (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
It's time to get back in the swing of things
When my life crashes, I'm not the guy that'll flee the scene
I'll take ownership and own it and raise my hand if it's me
Just remember though, I'm only a man, I'm a human being
Don't they see? Shoot the breeze, I'd rather just stay discrete
People claim they're in your corner, but leave you in times of need
They don't listen, do they? (What?) They don't listen to anything
I'll accept advice if it's not presented ignorantly
Look, costs are high, they multiply
Then cause divides, I'm forced to fight
The poison I been sippin' on has quite the bite, it killed me twice
They rigged the lights so y'all can see
The parts of mine that aren't so bright
See, often I apologize, then authorize the awful times
To pop up (Nate!) like I'm right behind you
I'd advise you not to try to climb inside the mind like I do
Keep the rhyme book, expedite it, overnight it
Hold it tight and hope that time is on my side
'Cause if it's not, then I'll decide to override my own demise
I toe the line too close and I could improvise
I'd empathize, but recognize
The fact that I could jeopardize and wreck our lives
You better give me your attention, the undivided
[Chorus]
Paid my dues, made it through (Woo, woo, woo)
Spread the news, I'm on the loose (Woo, woo, woo)
Makin' moves, I need some room (Woo, woo, woo)

Hey!
Leave me alone

Panic-stricken, handle business, not a joke, yeah
Manners missin', travel different, no control, yeah
Time to listen, time to zip it, keep it closed
My description, highly gifted, take some notes, yeah
Lack of interest, why'd you visit? Hit the road, yeah
I'm kinda twisted, so keep your distance, be a ghost
Yeah, see I'm inventive, but quite the menace, you ain't know?
Well then I'm offended, let's jog your memories, here we go, yeah
I went from nobody to kinda famous
Hide my plaques inside the closet, I just can't explain it
My wife, she tells me that she's proud and thinks that I should hang 'em
But I just leave 'em on the ground right next to my self-hatred
Yeah, yeah, mental health, where's my mental health?
Diagnosed with OCD, what does that mean? Well, gather 'round
That means I obsessively obsess on things I think about
That means I might take a normal thought and think it's so profound (Leave me alone)
Ruminating, fill balloons up full of doubts
Do the same things, if I don't, I'm overwhelmed (Leave me alone)
Thoughts are pacing, they go 'round and 'round and 'round
It's so draining, let's move onto something else, fine (Oh) (Leave me alone)
Runnin' the game, but they don't even know it
Like I'm undercover and don't wanna blow it
I come out of nowhere, they don't even notice
The flow is so cold, you would think it was snowin' (Oh) (Leave me alone)
I'm under the weather, but wind isn't blowin'
I got an umbrella for difficult moments
You got to admit it, I'm very devoted
I'm out in the rain, but it don't always open, so I (I, I)
[Pre-Chorus]
Hold up my balloons and cover up my face
I can feel them weighin' on me every day
I should let 'em go and watch 'em float away
But I'm scared if I do, then I'll be more afraid (More afraid)
Tell them how I feel, but they don't wanna change (Don't wanna change)
Tell them how I feel, but they remain the same (Same)
Loosen up my grip, they say that's not okay
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, ayy, leave me alone! (Oh)

I hate when they debate if we're underrated
We're so overlooked that they're lookin' over our numbers, Nathan (Leave me alone)
We don't do enough interviews or go out in public lately
We don't post enough on our socials
To keep the buzz from fading (Leave me alone)
Let it fade, yeah, let it fade
Once it's decimated, then you drop a song outta nowhere
And all the fans embrace it (Leave me alone)
Then the buzz will surface again, it's part of my operation
I don't need advice from my doubts right now
End of conversation (Leave me alone)
Shut your mouth, yeah, shut your mouth
Better tone it down, close it now
If you make a sound, I'ma change the dial (Leave me alone)
Funny how they be acting loud, comin' unannounced
It's floating 'round
Man, the kid is wild, pretty vile, true (Leave me alone)
I'm kinda funny but don't really show it
I keep it together but have a disorder
I go to my room and I sit in my corner
And talk to myself in a language that's foreign (Leave me alone)
I think of a rhyme and I have to record it
But know if I don't, I'll wake up in the mornin'
And question my life again, always avoiding
I hate to be different, but hate to be normal, so I (Leave me alone)

Hold up my balloons and cover up my face

Told you I hung up, it kinda felt wrong (Leave me alone) (Wrong, wrong)
Finally called him back, we didn't talk long (No)
He asked me how I'd been, I sent him this song (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Yeah, think he took offense, he kinda seemed off (Off)
I texted him that night to ask what he thought (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
It took a couple days to get a response
But once I finally did, he said this song sucks (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Feel the symptoms, couldn't miss 'em, wrestle with 'em
Then I pin and flip 'em, brought some back up
No, well, you should get some (Leave me alone, quiet, quiet, quiet)
Who you dissin'? Mood is switchin', don't come in the kitchen
You should listen, cookin' record for my hands are blisterin'

Too many faces, too many faces, too many faces

[Verse]
Yeah, what's your definition of success? (Ayy)
I don't trust the thoughts that come inside my head (Woo)
I don't trust this thing that beats inside my chest
Who I am and who I wanna be cannot connect; why?
Don't think I deserve it? You get no respect (Woo)
I just made a couple mil', still not impressed
""Let You Down"" goes triple platinum, yeah, okay, okay, I guess (Ayy)
Smile for a moment then these questions startin' to fill my head, not again!
I push away the people that I love the most; why? (Woo)
I don't want no one to know I'm vulnerable; why? (Woo)
That makes me feel weak and so uncomfortable; why? (Ayy)
Stop askin' me questions, I just wanna feel alive
Until I die—this isn't Nate's flow (Woo)
Just let me rhyme; I'm in disguise
I'm a busy person, got no time for lies; one of a kind
They don't see it; I pull out they eyes; I'm on the rise!
I've been doin' this for most my life with no advice (Woo)
Take my chances, I just roll the dice, do what I like
As a kid, I was afraid of heights, put that aside
Now I'm here and they look so surprised, well so am I, woo
They don't invite me to the parties, but I still arrive
Kick down the door and then I go inside
Give off that ""I do not belong here"" vibe
Then take the keys right off the counter, let's go for a ride
Why do y'all look mortified? (Ayy)
I keep to myself, they think I'm sorta shy, organized
""Let You Down's"" the only song you've heard of? Well then you're behind (Woo)
Story time; wish that I could think like Big Sean does, but I just can't decide (aah!)
If I should stick my knife inside of Pennywise
I, I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (Haha)
I do not need nobody to help me—lies
I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?
I don't understand, it's got me questionin' like
""Why? Just tell me why""—not back to this flow
Inside I feel divided
Back when I ain't had a dime, but had the drive
Back before I ever signed, I questioned life, like, ""Who am I, man?"" Woo
Nothin' to me's ever good enough
I could be workin' for 24 hours a day and think I never did enough
My life is a movie, but there ain't no tellin' what you're gonna see in my cinema (No)
I wanna be great, but I get in the way of myself and I think about everything that I could never be
Why do I do it though? Ayy, yeah
Why you always lookin' aggravated?
Not a choice, you know I had to make it
When they talk about the greatest, they gon' probably never put us in the conversation
Like somethin', then I gotta take it
Write somethin', then I might erase it
I love it, then I really hate it
What's the problem, Nathan? I don't know!
I know I like to preach to always be yourself (Yeah)
But my emotions make me feel like I am someone else
Me and pride had made a pact that we don't need no help
Which feels like I'm at war inside myself, but I forgot the shells
I hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but not a lot know me well
Hold my issues up for all to see, like show and tell
A lot of people know me, but they don't know me well

(sduolc eht ni s'daeH)

[Verse 1]
Calmly, feel myself evolving
Appalling, so much I'm not divulging
Been stalling, I think I hear applauding, they're calling
Mixtapes aren't my thing, but it's been awfully exhausting
Hanging on to songs this long is daunting (Yeah)
Which caused me to have to make a call I thought was ballsy
Resulting in what you see today, proceed indulging
As always, the one-trick pony's here, so quit your sulking

[Verse 2]
Born efficient, got ambition, sorta vicious, yup, that's me (Woo)
Not artistic, unrealistic, chauvinistic, not those things
Go the distance, so prolific, posts are cryptic, move swiftly
Unsubmissive, the king of mischief, the golden ticket, rare sight to see
I stay committed, embrace the rigid
I'm playful with it, yeah, basically
Too great to mimic, you hate, you're bitter
No favoritism, that's fine with me
Create the riddles, portrayed uncivil
Unsafe a little, oh, yes, indeed
It's plain and simple, I'm far from brittle
Unbreakable, you following?
I'm Bruce Willis in a train wreck
I'm like tradin' in your car for a new jet
I'm like havin' a boss getting upset
'Cause you asked him for less on your paycheck
I'm like doin' headstands with a broke neck
I'm like watchin' your kid take his first steps
I'm like sayin' Bill Gates couldn't pay rent
'Cause he's too broke,— where am I goin' with this?
[Verse 3]
Unbelievable, yes, yes, inconceivable
See myself as fairly reasonable
But at times I can be stubborn, so
If I have to, I will rock the boat
I don't tend to take the easy road
That's just not the way I like to roll
What you think's probably unfeasible
I've done already a hundredfold
A hundredfold, it's probable
That I might press the envelope
Ideas so astronomical
Sometimes I find 'em comical
Yeah, incomparable
Replay value phenomenal
Beat selection remarkable
Slowing me down, impossible

[Verse 4]
I don't rock no Rollies
I don't hang around no phonies (Nope)
I don't really got no trophies
I don't know why God chose me (I don't know)
Got somethin' in the cup, ain't codeine (Never)
Change my style, they told me
Now they come around like, ""Homie""
Man, y'all better back up slowly, back up slowly (Woo!)
[Verse 5]
Who are you kiddin'?
How could you doubt me? I've always delivered
Rippin' the teeth out of the back of my mouth's
The closest you get to my wisdom
See, my initial thought was to wait
But what can I say? I had to come visit
Check on you guys, you doin' alright?
Your year really sucked? Yeah, that's what I figured
They cover they heads up whenever I drop
Shake the whole industry, put 'em in shock
Come out the clouds like a meteor rock
Then land on the earth like, ""Ready or not?""
Ain't no one like me, the cream of the crop
Don't even front better, give me some props
I pick up your body and throw it a block
Okay, I admit it, that's over the top—not!

[Verse 6]
Deer in the headlights looks every time I step my foot
On the ground, I get mistook
For a lame with no weight to his name
Ground just shook
Let's not beat around the bush
Even my B-sides throw 'em off like, ""How's he do it?""
Some say I'm a great influence
I don't know about that, but I did do the best I could
[Bridge]
""Hollywood, Hollywood
Hope Nate doesn't go Hollywood""
You think that, you don't know me good
You think that, you don't know me good
""Hollywood, Hollywood
Hope Nate doesn't go Hollywood""
You think that, you don't know me good
You think that, you don't know me

[Verse 7]
I–I–I, I always advance
Say how I feel, you know where I stand
Raisin' the bar, I gotta expand
Top of the charts, I'm settin' up camp
Pound in my stakes, I put up my tent
Shoot for the stars, they fall in my hand
Stick to my guns, I don't even flinch
Can push all you want, ain't movin' an inch
I rarely miss, you know I'm relentless
Ain't got a choice, no way to prevent it
Just who I am, and I don't regret it
See what I want and then I go get it
Followed my gut, I'm happy I did it
Beat all the odds, I ain't got no limits
Cannot be stopped, you payin' attention?
I ain't gotta say it, they know where my head is
They know where my head is (Head is)239Embed"

Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I’m changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I’m workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin’ like I’m gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you’re at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn’t it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright

I just need some time, I'm tryna think straight
I just need a moment in my own space
Ask me how I'm doin', I say ""okay,"" yeah
But ain't that what we all say?
Sometimes I think back to the old days
In the pointless conversations with the old me
Yeah, back when my momma used to hold me
I wish somebody woulda told me

[Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, as a kid I used to think life
Is moving so slow, I watch it go by
Look out the window on my bus ride
I thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes
I've always tried to control things
In the end that's what controls me
Maybe that's why I'm controllin'
I wish somebody woulda told me

If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change
If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away
If you want love, if you want love

[Verse 3]
The older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time
Talkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice
Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right
I'm scared that one day I'll wake up and wonder where'd the time go
Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow
I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own
And tell 'em

[Chorus]
If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain
I wish you woulda told me

Yeah, they say when you grow up
""You'll understand when you're older""
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know if
If I'll ever let go of this (Yeah)
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me (Real music)
I know I could die any moment
If I do, just remember this

[Verse 1]
Yeah, handouts create lazy people I'm not impressed with
You want something in life, then why don't you go and get it?
Actions speak louder than words do—it's pretty quiet, isn't it?
Look at the world we live in, defined by comment sections (Woah)
Surround yourself with people that challenge how you think
Not people that nod their head and act like they agree
Those people will cut you open just to watch you bleed
Always be yourself, not the person that you pretend to be, no!
These people gon' tell you that you won't ever make it
Then when you do, they gon' say they knew you were goin' places
That's just how it works, next thing you know you'll be overrated
Hearing people say they miss the old you—it's crazy, ain't it?
And perfect people don't exist, so don't pretend to be one
I don't need pats on the back from people for my achievements
When I die I wanna know that I lived for a reason
Anyone can take your life, but not what you believe in, no!

Yeah, they say when you grow up
""You'll understand when you're older""
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know if

I know I could die any moment
If I do, just remember this

[Verse 2]
Yeah, don't take opinions from people that won't listen to yours
If money's where you find happiness, you'll always be poor
If you don't like the job you have, then what do you do it for?
The cure to pain isn't something you buy at liquor stores, nah
The real you is not defined by the size of your office
The real you is who you are when ain't nobody watchin'
You spend your whole life worried about what's in your wallet
For what? That money won't show up in your coffin, woo!
Yeah, anger's a liar, he ain't got no respect
I fell in love with my pain and I slept with my regrets
Happiness saw it happen, maybe that's why she up and left
Joy called me a cheater, said she ain't coming back
I've always had a problem with relationships
But that's what happens when you see the world through a broken lens
Mistakes can make you grow, that doesn't mean you're friends
Who you are is up to you, don't leave it up to them, no
[Chorus]
Yeah, they say when you grow up
""You'll understand when you're older""
Guess I'm still a kid, I don't know if
If I'll ever let go of this
Say goodbye to the old me
We ain't friends anymore, you don't know me
I know I could die any moment
If I do, just remember this

[Verse 3]
Yeah, they say, ""You got into music, you signed up to be hated""
That's kinda weird 'cause I don't remember signing my name up
Coming from people that give advice but never take none
I like my privacy, but, lately, I feel it's invaded
I heard that life's too short, don't let it pass you by
We waste a lot of time crying over wasted time
It's not about what people think, it's how you feel inside
My biggest failures in life are knowing I never tried, woo!
I look at the world from a different angle
People change, even Satan used to be an angel
Think twice before you're bitin' on the hand that made you
Don't believe what you believe just 'cause that's how they raised you
Think your own thoughts, don't let them do it for you
Say you want a drink, don't wait for people to pour it on you
Cut out the liars, stay close to people you know are loyal
Grab your own glass and fill it, don't let your fear destroy you, woo!134Embed"

For you, but you just left us
We needed you, I needed you

[Verse 1]
Yo, I don't know what it's like to be addicted to pills
But I do know what it's like to be a witness, it kills
Mama told me she loved me, I'm thinkin' this isn't real
I think of you when I get a whiff of that cigarette smell, yeah
Welcome to the bottom of hell
They say pain is a prison, let me out of my cell
You say you proud of me, but you don't know me that well
Sit in my room, tears runnin' down my face and I yell
Into my pillowcases, say you comin' to get us
Then call a minute later just to tell us you're not, I'm humiliated
I'm in a room with a parent that I don't barely know
Some lady in the corner watchin' us while she's takin' notes
I don't get it, Mom, don't you want to watch your babies grow?
I guess pills are more important, all you have to say is ""no""
But you won't do it, will you? You gon' keep poppin' 'til them pills kill you
I know you're gone, but I can still feel you

[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey
[Verse 2]
I got this picture in my room and it kills me
But I don't need a picture of my mom, I need the real thing
Now a relationship is somethin' we won't ever have
But why do I feel like I lost somethin' that I never had?
You shoulda been there when I graduated
Told me you loved me and congratulations
Instead you left us at the window waitin'
Where you at mom?
We're too young to understand, where you at, huh?
Yeah, I know them drugs have got you held captive
I can see it in your eyes, they got your mind captured
Some say it's fun to get the high, but I am not laughin'
And what you don't realize and what you're not graspin'
That I was nothin' but a kid who couldn't understand it
I ain't gon' say that I forgive you 'cause it hasn't happened
I thought that maybe I'd feel better as time passes
If you really cared for me, then where you at then?

[Chorus]
Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh
Hey

[Verse 3]
Our last conversation, you and I sat in the livin' room
Talkin' 'bout my music and I brought you some to listen to
You started cryin', tellin' me this isn't you
A couple weeks later, guess you were singin' a different tune
You took them pills for the last time, didn't you?
They took you from us once, I guess they came back to finish you
Cryin' my eyes out in the studio is difficult
Music is the only place that I can go to speak to you
It took everything inside of me, not to scream at your funeral
Sittin' in my chair, that person talkin' was pitiful
I wish you were here, mama, but every time I picture you
All I feel is pain, I hate the way I remember you
They found you on the floor, I could tell you felt hollow
Gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
You gave everything you had, plus your life to them pill bottles
Don't know if you hear me or not, but if you're still watchin', why?

Why would you leave us? Why would you leave us?
How could you leave us here?
How could you leave us? Why would you leave us? Oh

Sometimes I think about things like, you know
When I'd have kids, I'm like...
You won't be there, you know?
You won't be there for any of that
And I'll never get to see you again
Sometimes I wish I would've just called you
I wish I would have just picked up the phone

Insidious is blind inception
What's reality with all these questions?
Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
Slept in
Broken legs, but I chase perfection
These walls are my blank expression
My mind is a home I'm trapped in
And it's lonely inside this mansion

[Verse 1: NF]
Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in lyrics
They're all over the place, there's songs in the mirrors
Written all over the floors, all over the chairs
And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
That's where I write when I'm in a bad place and need to release
And let out the version of NF you don't wanna see
I put holes in the walls with both of my fists 'til they bleed
You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
Physically abused, now that's the room that I don't wanna be in
That picture ain't blurry at all, I just don't wanna see it
And these walls ain't blank, I just think I don't wanna see 'em
But why not? I'm in here, so I might as well read 'em
I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
Matter of fact, I think I'ma burn this room right now
Somehow, this memory, for some reason, just won't burn down
You used to put me in the corner, so you could see the fear in my eyes
Then took me downstairs and beat me till I screamed and I cried
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
But I'ma keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside

[Verse 2: NF]
Yo, my mind is a house with walls, covered in pain
See, my problem is, I don't fix things, I just try to repaint
Cover 'em up, like it never happened, say, ""I wish I could change""
Are you confused? Come upstairs and I'll show you what I mean
This room's full of regrets, it just keeps getting fuller, it seems
The moment I walk into it's the same moment that I wanna leave
I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
But it's hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
I look around, one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
One of the first things I wrote was, ""I wish I woulda called""
But I should just stop now, we ain't got enough room in this song
And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
Shrug it off like it ain't nothing, like it's out of my hands
Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
And I regret watchin' these trust issues eat me alive
And at the rate I'm goin', they'll probably still be there when I die
Congratulations, you'll always have a room in my mind
The question is, will I ever clean the walls off in time?

Insidious is blind inception

And it's lonely inside this mansion, inside this mansion

[Verse 3: NF]
So this part of my house, no one's been in it for years
I built a safe room and I don't let no one in there
'Cause if I do, there's a chance that they might disappear
And not come back, and I admit, I am emotionally scared
To let anyone inside, so I just leave my doors locked
You might get other doors to open up, but this door's not
'Cause I don't want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
And I'll be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
I'm barricaded inside, so stop watchin'
I'm not coming to the door, so stop knockin', stop knockin'
I'm trapped here, God keeps saying I'm not locked in
I chose this, I am lost in my own conscience
I know that shuttin' the world out ain't solvin' the problem
But I didn't build this house because I thought it would solve 'em
I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
But it's not, I'm not the only thing that's livin' in here
Fear came to my house years ago, I let him in
Maybe that's the problem, 'cause I've been dealing with this ever since
I thought that he would leave, but it's obvious, he never did
He must have picked a room and got comfortable and settled in
Now I'm in a position, it's either sit here and let 'em win
Or put him back outside where he came from, but I never can
'Cause in order to do that, I'd have to open the doors
Is that me or the fear talking? I don't know anymore

It's lonely (It's lonely)

What, are you scared of me? That's embarassin'
If it wasn't for me, you would've never wrote Therapy
I've been here for you, but how come you're never there for me?
It's a little bit twisted, but I miss when you and I had scary dreams
I don't really wanna talk about it!
Well, that's too bad now, Nate
Shut up!
Now, where were we?
Well, back in the day when
You and I had it all mapped out in the basement
Cryin' in your room like a baby
""I wish mom was here!""
We all do so we wouldn't have to hear about it every single record
You don't really wanna change me
Yeah, I'm the one that made this happen
Do you really wanna get rid of your main attraction?
Let's pack our bags and go back to Gladwin now
Yeah, it's time for the third record
And you know I got the content
I don't wanna make you nervous
But it ain't like it used to be, we got a lotta people watchin'
You told me that you don't want me in your life, that's pretty hard to digest
And I told you I'd leave when we die, and we ain't died yet
Therapy Session was beautiful, Nate, but I'm wonderin' what's comin' next
Yeah, get that stupid hat off of your head when I'm talkin' to you, you hear what I said?
You don't like the prison I built you?
Yeah, you wanna know what the funny thing is?
You keep on talkin' to me like a stranger
But we've been together since you were a kid (Kid), yeah
Took us from a no-name
Told you everything was okay
Now you tryna cut me out of it like I ain't never been a part of it
I am the heart of it, I made this whole thing
Yeah, I put us on the dope stage, you must have no brain
What's the point of having guns if you can't aim?
What's the point of havin' blood with no veins?
What's the point of havin' love with no pain?
What I'm sayin' is me without you doesn't make any sense
I know I'm intense and controlling, but you need to learn how to cope with it, that's just the way that it is
If you didn't want me to live in your house, you shouldn't have let me move in
It's comfortable here and I like it, I got my own room and everything, it don't get better than this
You say you wanna own your life, then wake up and take your own advice
You just mad 'cause you know I'm right
Yeah, I'm flattered you put me in Mansion, but you shoulda told 'em right
Hold your hands on the coldest nights
You didn't tell 'em 'bout the times you and I used to hold the mic
I mean, what are you, outta your mind?
'Cause both of us will be, come on, let's go outside!
Is this what you wanted?
Both of us out in the open? Let's do it then!
I mean, why are you doin' this?
I know that you're mad (That you're mad), but I'm not in the mood for this
We got a record to drop (Drop)
So why you actin' like I'm not a part of it?
Aye, where is my shovel at?
Prolly out back where it always is
You can't get rid of all of me!
I'm the reason why—
Nah, shut up, I don't wanna hear another sentence
Hey, I'm NF
""Is it me or the fear talkin'?"" Ha! What a dumb question!
Yeah, it's real music 'til the day we die, right?
Yeah, ain't that the slogan, Nathan?
Thought I told you to keep your mouth shut
I mean, so what? You know I never listen
Let me guess: we gon' dig a hole, kill the track and prolly put a beat in it
Rap about it for like three minutes
Ayy, that's pretty deep, isn't it?
Wait a minute, you don't really think for a second that you're puttin' me in this?
No, of course not, just a little deeper then we'll go inside and we can stop diggin' (Woo)
You had me scared for a second, I thought we were diggin' my grave
*thunk*
We did, what, you don't like bein' afraid?
Here's a dose of your own medicine
What, you don't like how it tastes?
My therapist told me don't bury my issues, but I'ma be honest, man, I'm feelin' great! (Great)
I think it's only right we go back to where you were created
I wrote a song for Johnny without you, but he ain't gon' like it, let's see how he takes it (Takes it)
He probably don't even remember us, does he?
I wish I was buryin' anger
But both of us know I'ma need him for that song (That song), he still lives in the basement
Almost done, shoulda done this a year ago, I don't know why I waited
You know how I get, I put everything off in my personal life, you hear what I'm sayin'? (Sayin')
That was a joke (Joke), yeah, it's hilarious, ain't it?
You'll spend the rest of your life in my backyard or back of my mind—depends how you see it
Put the shovel away, time to go back in the house now, you'll be out in a week
Tellin' me you want your room back, that's funny; what? You ain't got nowhere to sleep?
I'ma just look out the window and laugh at you, this is crazy to me
'Cause I thought you had me in prison this whole time, but I'm the one holdin' the keys (Holdin' the keys, holdin' the keys, holdin' the keys)126Embed"

Yeah, I got off stage like a month ago
I was talking to fans
And one of 'em pulled me aside and said
""We never met, but I swear that you know who I am
I've been through a lot
I don't know how to express it to people, don't think that I can
But I got that Mansion CD on rotation
That's real for me, Nate, you do not understand""
It's crazy for me
Kids hit me up, say they slittin' they wrists on the daily
This music is more than you think
Don't book me for just entertainment, it's entertainin'
Hearin' these parents, they telling their kids
My music is violent—you gotta be kidding me
I guess that your definition of violence and mine
Is something that we look at differently
How do you picture me, huh?
Want me to smile, you want me to laugh?
You want me to walk on the stage with a smile on my face
When I'm mad and put on a mask? For real though
I mean, what you expect from me?
I'm tryna do this respectfully
They say that life is a race
I knew my problems would prolly catch up eventually
I do my best to be calm
How you gon' write me and tell me you'd slaughter my family?
That's just a glimpse to the stuff that gets sent to me
These are the parts of my life they don't never see, woo!
I am aware, it's aggressive
I am not here for acceptance
I don't know what you expected
But what you expect when you walk in a therapy session, huh?
[Chorus]
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

[Verse 2]
This girl at the show looked me in the face
And told me her life's full of drama (Yeah!)
Said her dad is abusive
Apparently, he likes to beat on her mama
I got so angry inside
I wanted to tell her to give me his number
But what you gon' do with it, right?
You gon' hit him up then he'll start hittin' her harder, that's real
These kids, they come to my shows
With tears in they eyes
'Magine someone looking at you
And sayin' your music's the reason that they are alive
Sometimes I don't know how to handle it
This type of life isn't glamorous
This ain't an act for the cameras (Nah!)
You see me walk on these stages
But have no idea what I'm dealing with after it, nah!
I put it all in the open
This is the way that I cope with all my emotion
I'm taking pictures with thousands of people
But honestly, I feel like nobody knows me
I'm tryin' to deal with depression
I'm tryin' to deal with the pressure
How you gon' tell me my music does not have a message
When I'm lookin' out at this crowd full of people I know I affected? Agh!
I got some things in my life (My life)
I know I should let 'em go (Let 'em go)
Let me jot it down (Jot it down)
Let me take a mental note (Mental note)
I put it all in this microphone (Microphone)
Think about that for a minute
What is the point of this song? I'm just ventin'
But what you expect from a therapy session, huh?
[Chorus]
Therapy, therapy session
Therapy, therapy session

[Verse 3]
What you think about me
—That doesn't worry me
I know I handle some things immaturely
I know that I need to grow in maturity
I ain't gon' walk on these stages, in front of these people
And act like I live my life perfectly
That doesn't work for me
""Christian"" is not the definition of what ""perfect"" means, woo!
I ain't the type to be quiet
I ain't gon' sit here in silence
If I wouldn't say what I say to your face
Then I promise you, I wouldn't say it in private
I am not lyin'
People go off on my page, and I'm tryin' to quit the replyin'
But this is ridiculous
I'm passionate, man, I really mean what I'm writing
You want me to keep it a hundred?
Okay, I'll keep it a hundred
I see a whole lot of talkin' on socials
But honestly, I don't see nothing in public
I kinda love it, yeah
""Why don't you write us some happy raps?
That would be awesome""
""All of your music is moody and dark, Nate""
—Don't get me started (Yeah!)
You wanna know what it's like if you met me in person?
Listen to my verses
This music is not just for people
Who sit in the pews and pray at the churches, nah!
I won't reject it
I don't expect everyone to respect it
I don't expect you to get my perspective
But what you expect from a therapy session?
Huh?
[Outro]
I mean, I think sometimes people—they confuse what I'm doin'
I write about life, I write about things that I'm actually dealing with
Something that I'm actually experiencing
This is real for me
Like, this is something that personally helps me as well
I'm not confused about who gave me the gift
God gave me the gift and He gave me the ability to—to do this
And He also gave me this as an outlet
And that's what music is for me
When I feel something, whether it's anger
Um, it's a passion about something—or frustration
Like, this is where I go
This is—this is—that's the whole ""NF Real Music"" thing, man
This is real for me—I need this
This is a therapy for me88Embed"

Yagh! Yeah
Tell me, what am I doin'?

Tell me, what am I doin'?

Will somebody get the body bags?
We gon' put the beats in 'em, nah
Put the MCs in 'em, season 'em
Put 'em on a beat with me then I'm eatin' 'em
Get away from the table, you rappers ain't hungry enough
You rappers ain't hungry like us
They talk about me like I'm here, they talk about you like you was, woo!
That nurse came into my room, she told me I'm sick in the head
I'm in hip-hop's hospital bed, with a pad and a pen and a brace on my neck
They told me that I'm never leavin'
Why? I am as ill as it gets
Any rapper that say that they runnin' the game
I'ma come in they session and cut off they legs, woo!
Strap a grenade to my head, pull out the pin
My music is mind-blowin'
Ain't nobody do it like I do it
You ain't ever been on my level
I got a problem with the way they keep on talkin'
And actin' like everybody gonna get it
Better sleep with your eyes open
You wanna know what I noticed?
Look around at my fan base and they ready (I see you!)
That last album was heavy (I see you!)
That last album was gritty
How you gon' match that? Just let me
Do what I do best, you're better off playin' Russian roulette
Than comin' in a booth with me 'cause I get
A little bit intense, I'm like, ""Who's next?""
Y'all better watch it, take a look at where the clock is
It's my time
This ladder of music that I climbed
I took the machete, the game isn't ready
Them rappers, they comin' up on me
I cut off the ladder, and I told 'em, ""Bye-bye"" (Bye-bye)
What, you lookin' for a high-five? Nice try! (Woo!)
Do not believe everything that you read on the internet
I do not know who your dentist is
But he should clean out your mouth
Don't call me a sellout, that's something I've never been
I've been through hell all my life though
But I know what Heaven is
Father forgive me, for I am a sinner
But You gave me music as medicine, woo!
If nobody want a problem when they get in my zone, better leave me be!
I'm a mean MC
Better feed me rappers or feed me beats, agh!
Feed me both of 'em
They like, ""Nate, what's it like to be famous?"" (Hahahahahaha)
Umm, I'll let you know if I make it! (Yeah)
I wonder what life would be like
If I didn't stick out my neck
Two hundred dollars inside of my bank account, woo!
I was livin' on that
I need some money to pay for my rent
I need some money to pay for my gas
I'm not complainin', I'm just bein' honest
I promise that I will not beg for respect, nah!
I get so frustrated, take a look at what I've created
Time is wasting, and I ain't waiting
I'm a doctor with no job, me, I don't have no patience
I keep pacing, back and forth, I keep racing
You ain't never been in my book and I got a problem with it, why? 'Cause you actin' like you read my pages
I wreck these stages
Real talk, better give me space 'cause I am chasing
Something they told me that I won't make it, agh!
I'm not famous, I'm just Nathan (Woo!)
And I wonder how the world gon' take this
They might hate it
But you know anything about me
You know that don't mean I'm changin'
'Cause you know I'm real with it
Don't care if you feelin' it, I'm feelin' it
You don't like it? Then deal with it
And if God ain't real, real isn't
Used to wonder why I existed
I exist in the world that's real different
And, ""What you gon' be when you grow up, Nate?""
I doubt they will get it
My life is a mess, better watch your step when you step in it
Some of this brain is off-limits
I'm off in a world you don't get
'Cause you ain't ever been in it
In ten minutes I still couldn't explain what's inside my brain, don't mess with it
I've invested a lot of me inside these lines, I'm just protectin' 'em
Everybody wanna hear the real version of life
Then don't get so sensitive when I say something a little bit raw
I jot my thoughts and they call it negative
You wanna know where my heart is?
I stand out 'cause I wear my garbage
I work my hardest
And every time I look into the mirror I don't forget about where I started, woo!

Look
Self-awareness
Pride's a coat and yes, I like to wear it
Buttoned up, don't like to let no air in
With a pair of gloves that I hope doesn't perish
I discovered, though, when I get holes in them and I let joy in, I'm in higher spirits
My mistakes are like a screamin' parrot
Just repeatin' lyrics, I can barely bear it when I'm lost
Road is narrow, I'm lookin' down it like a gun's barrel
Aren't we all searchin' for the serum
That could help us breathe and leave our state of peril?
All of us have made defensive scarecrows
That we scatter 'round our fields and treat like heroes
When they scare away the things that we should cherish
'Cause we're too embarrassed to admit the fear is that we're lost
Yeah, but what does it matter?
I get so combative, inside of me's a personal canvas
The paint can be splattered, get messy when I start to get rattled
The heart of a savage, I'm quiet when I lurk in the shadows
But somethin' don't add up, I don't wanna be overdramatic
But look at the data, it's obvious that humans are fragile
We tend to get mad at the ones that call us out but the fact is
We need someone that'll be honest when we fly off the handle
I admit I throw a fit when I begin to unravel
Keep my wits, been off the grid but now I'm back in the saddle
My intent is not to rent, I like to own what I value
I could sit here on the fence or maybe pick up the paddle
I like to row against the current, that's the way that I travel
Opposite of what the grain does, got the brain of a rebel
Take initiative, I'm diligent on every level
I never could settle, I like to keep my foot on the pedal, yeah
I'd love to pack arenas and all
But what I really wanna do is learn to handle my thoughts
And put the reins on 'em, show 'em I'm the one that's the boss
And pull 'em back when they get out of hand, I'm breakin' they jaws
I'm takin' the flaws, that told me I could never evolve
Then pull a Bane on 'em, ask 'em, ""Oh, you think you're in charge?""
You oughta know better, ain't no way around it, I'm flawed
The traits that I want, they say I can't afford what it cost
[Pre-Chorus 1: NF]
But I, manifested this
Failing's how you grow and learn your lessons, kids
Take the worst and try to make the best of it
'Cause when you fail, just know that it's a test and if
You can learn to pick yourself back up again
And train your brain to not be such a pessimist
It's okay to make mistakes, just don't forget that
There's a high road but I skip the exit when I'm lost (Lost)

[Chorus: NF]
Yeah
When I'm lost
When I'm lost (Lost)
When I'm lost
When I'm lost, lost

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
Wow, these burdens are heavy
And I'm hopin' it don't bury me
I used to be joyful and skip so merrily
But now I'm too cautious and tip toe carefully
My mind left and it's nowhere to be found
Am I a big ol' parody?
'Cause it's no fair to me
And now I'm at the point where I'm spending a grand a week on hypnotherapy
Look, I'm tryna wash away my sins
I got a group of loved ones that ain't my friends
And if I ever take an L then they might grin
And they all wanna see me stay in the cage I'm in
So when it come to anybody, there's no trust for no one
Man, so what? My whole plan's to go nuts
My shoulders ready for more shrugs, I'm gon' judge
Anybody tryna enter my circle with no love (Hol' up)
My sanity's gone, I'd rather be torn
From this planet they planted me on, yes, that's a reward
I'm actually bored with having a sore heart
It's torn apart from a family that I don't have anymore (Man, hol' up)
I was livin' so oblivious
With millions, it really was a pity, huh? (A pity, huh?)
It's kinda funny what a penny does
Mixed in with a mini buzz (I feel stuck)
Life's got me by the neck, with a blade against it (What?)
Guess I was runnin' late for the train and missed it (What?)
The only thing I feel is pain and vengeance (What?)
So I'ma act out like a ragin' misfit (What?)
And every verse I lay gon' stay sadistic (Yeah)
You wanna hate me? Good, great, terrific (Good)
You'll never see the day where my anger's dismissed
You better go and change your wish list 'cause I

Hopin' He gon' add my testament

I just wanna take a hit, keep sayin' I'ma quit
Keep sayin' I'ma leave, but I stay though

Lettin' go of things that I'm attached to
World don't stop just because I'm in a bad mood
You don't know what love is 'til you holdin' onto somethin' that you can't lose
I swear I'm tryna get it together
Sleeves up, puttin' work in, tryna be better
I like to rap, but I ain't gon' do it forever
Forget the charts, I've been focusing' on holdin' my head up
Moment I get up, I just wanna know I'm doin' my best
And if I'm not, Lord forgive me, you can have the regrets
'Cause I can feel the water tryna go up over my head
Most of my life, I always felt like I was holdin' my breath
Holdin' my chest, to be honest, so I'm tired of it

Got a lot of mood swings
Oh, you wanna tell me somethin' negative?
I don't wanna hear what you think
Yeah, tossin' in my sleep
Every night for like two weeks
Thinkin' 'bout how I could have done this or done that better
Can't help it, that's just me
Lies, that's me avoidin' the change
Yeah, that's probably why the issues ain't goin' away
Yeah, that's probably why I always sit around and complain
Tellin' myself that I ain't never gettin' out of this place
Out of my face if you tellin' me I need to be different
That's the issue though, I'm always insecurity-driven
Takin' the wrong turns, actin' like I know where I'm headed
Waitin' for somethin' bad to happen, I can snap any minute
I need change
Yeah, that's kinda easy to say, right?
But difficult to do when I feel like I hate life
And everyone around me kinda thinks I'm a great guy
But I don't ever think it so I think I'm a fake liar
Change
It's somethin' that I know I should do
I'm a little uncomfortable, to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you lately, I got nothin' to lose
See, I've always been full of pain, but now I'm makin' some room

I need a moment of silence
I don't like change, but I'll try it
I don't wanna hear what I should or I shouldn't do
Why are they always defiant?
See, all my emotions are liars
All my emotions are violent
They don't want freedom to find me
Mention a name and everybody riots (Change)
Yeah, that's why I'm checkin' my vitals
They keep on workin', but I know
Breathin' don't mean you're alive, so
I bag up all of my trash and walk out on my tightrope
Positive thoughts are my rivals (Change)
I'm tryna be on their side though
Should I feel comfortable? I don't
Last year, I felt suicidal
This year, I might do somethin' different like talkin' to God more

I came a long way, why you lookin' upset?
I'm tryna paint a picture, get the vision, you ain't hear it yet, woo!
Look, hold up, hold up, wait a minute, please
Flow's switchin', I got ADD
Brain scatters when you play the beat
It don't matter what you say to me
I'll be doin' this at eighty-three
I've been doin' this since ABCs
In the major leagues doin' major things, don't play with me, woo!
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
Wake up every morning thinkin' I'ma have a bad day
Drive my own car, I don't like the valet
Park then I go into my mind with an AK
Shoot every thought in my head then it rotates
Losin' it all, but I think that I'm okay
Who is involved? I don't know, but I'm insane
Poof! And I'm gone, wanna call me a no name, what!?
I'm prolly not what you thought
I'm prolly not what you thought
I used to judge everybody that wasn't like me 'til I learned it was wrong
Girl told me I should get it together and get out the dark
I'm tryna give her my heart
That's when I sit in my car, writin' for hours until I can barely talk
I mean, where do I start?
Feels like I'm fallin' apart
Act like my image is hard
I always put up my guard
Even when talkin' to God
Sit in my room and I plot
Everything that I'm not
Comes out in the music I jot
I give it all that I got
I give it all that I got!
I'm tryna think out the box, no!
Yeah, I got people standing outside a bus screaming my name
I don't come out and take pictures, they tell me I changed
I don't smile in VIPs, you get mad like, ""You know what I paid?""
Guess I don't know what to say
Guess I don't know what to say
I leave it all on the stage
I leave it all on the stage111Embed"

I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself

[Verse 1]
Yeah, late nights are the worst for me
They bring out the worst in me
Mind runnin', got me feelin' like it hurts to think
If this is all that I wanted, I don't want it, gotta be more for me
All the core beliefs
And every mornin' I wake up and feel like I am not worth it 'cause I'm at war with peace
I go to Hell, walk up to the corpse of me
Look at the body like, ""You ain't nothin' but poor and weak""
It's kinda weird
Lately I been feelin' like the only way for me to get away is if I pour the drink
That's more deceit, more defeat
Is this really what I'm born to be?
That's what you get for thinkin' you're unique
So poor, but I'm so wealthy
Need help, but you can't help me
What else can the world sell me?
Tell me lies, I still buy 'em like they're goin' outta stock
But it's not healthy
[Chorus]
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself

[Verse 2]
Yeah, late nights get the best of me
They know how to get to me
Suicide thoughts come and go like a guest to me
But I don't wanna die, I just wanna get relief
So don't talk to me like you think I'm so successful
What is success when hope has left you?
I am not a spokesman, I'm a broken record
Sick of doin' interviews 'cause I hate myself, agh!
Come across like it's so easy
But I feel like you don't need me
When I feel like you don't need me
Then I feel like you don't see me
And my life has no meaning, drain me
Hands out, tryna ask for love
But when I get it, I just pass it up
Throw it away and think about it later
Diggin' through the trash for drugs
Wish I could give you what you needed, but I can't
I'm scared because
[Chorus]
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself

[Verse 3]
I walk through the ashes of my passions
Reminiscin' with the baggage in my casket
Get lost in the questions I can't answer
Can't stand who I am, but it don't matter
We scream to be free, but I stay captured
Knee-deep in defeat of my own actions
Feel weak, but the peace that I keep lacking
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it
But I can't have it
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it
But I can't have it
Keeps speakin' to me, but I can't have it

[Chorus]
I don't see you like I should
You look so misunderstood
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Pray to God with my arms open
If this is it, then I feel hopeless
And I wish I could help
But it's hard when I hate myself
Hate myself
But it's hard when I hate myself
Hate myself
But it's hard when I hate myself

I'm lookin' like I'm gonna get it, you prolly don't get it
I come in your house with a microphone
Lookin' like I'm 'bout to set up a show in your kitchen
I'm out of my mind, but I feel like I'm in it
If I never make it, don't make any difference
I'm still gonna kill it, you know what the deal is
Ain't never no chillin' when I'm in the buildin'
NF is a monster, I am a villain
My music is sick, and you don't know what ill is
You better get back, I don't write any filler
I write what I feel and I'm feelin' a million
So you better shh, be quiet, you hear it?
I'm 'bout to lose it
I'm on a whole different level of music
Don't treat me like I have no clue how to do this
You better rethink what you're thinkin' and move it
Now picture me writin' when I was a kid
Tryna make it in music, I think it is crazy
I spent all my money on studio time
Tryna get on my music so people could play it
I'ma keep it one hundred, my music was terrible
Learned to get better the more that I made it
Go back to my Moments album, most of you people
You prolly don't know what I'm sayin', hold up
What you're witnessin' now? Don't try to figure me out
I grab on that microphone, jawin' the crowd
They was laughin' at me, who they laughin' at now, huh?
I laugh at myself, some people they lookin' like, ""Wow
The moment you told me that you was a rapper
I couldn't believe it,"" you believe it now?
Step in the booth and I murder it
You never heard of a rapper that kill it like I do
I sleep on the couch in the studio
Stay up till three in the morning, and write till I get more
The moment I wake up I feel like I don't even sleep
And I'm ready to put out my record
Which, thank you for buyin', maybe you burned it
But either way, I'm gonna wreck it
I look at the industry, look what it did to me
You'll never make it if you never grind
You put a whole lot of money into it
You better be ready to give it your time
I look at the past awful years of my life
And I promise you I have been givin' it mine
Try to keep up with this, I'm not a puppet
No string on my back, I'm one of a kind
Music is changing, no way to tame this
I am an artist, look what I painted
Hang up the caution tape, I'm dangerous
Does anyone know where my brain is?
Rappers are comfortable knowin' they're famous
But I, really don't care what your name is
And I, really don't care if I'm nameless
Y'all just drivin' around, I know where my lane is
Cocky? Nah, I'm competitive
This is a job for me, it's adrenaline
Don't try to box me in, I am Mayweather
I come in the ring, my punches are way better
I never drink, but I live in these bars
The moment you blink is the moment you lost
Say you a king, who put you in charge?
Don't care what you think, I'll break in your car
Climb on the top of it, sound the alarm
And wake up the neighborhood, rap in your yard
And carry the speakers on both of my arms
Till you keep sleepin' on me, I'm at large
Enough with the jokes, I ain't jokin'
You come in a session with me, I'ma show you what dope is
And when I say dope, I ain't talkin' 'bout smokin'
I'm talkin' 'bout music that has an emotion
I look at this mic, it's part of my family
Take it away, I'm comin' to find you
I've been through a lot in my life
And it's hard to get people to listen when no one's behind you
And then Capitol came in the picture and gave me a shot
And look at it now
I look at the team I'm dealin' with, agh
These people ain't playin' around
Lookin' back, I gotta laugh
I was in a whole different place a year ago
I look at the math, I look at the map
And thank you God, I swear it's a miracle
And I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
But, man, this track was beautiful
The least I can do if I murder a beat
Is take the time to go to its funeral, haha88Embed"

Woke up in the cell, where am I at?
Yeah, it's cold, but I like that
What am I, trapped?
Heart's beating out of my chest
Door's locked, but the keys are in my hands
Hmm, yeah, that's weird, it doesn't make sense, does it?
I make songs, I don't make friends—judge me
Might smile, but it ain't that funny
Sing along to the pain, they love it
Life's like a merry-go-round
And I'm still tryna figure it out
I like space, I don't fit in the crowds
My whole life I've been airin' it out
Oh, I'm gettin' into character now
Feels wrong, but it feels right
My feelings seal tight real nice
But I will fight anything to win
But I'm not Mike Tyson, I won't bite ya
But I will tell you if I don't like you
I am not the norm
I got my own shoes, I ain't tryna fit in yours
I never been married, but I've felt divorced
Hi, I'm Nate, have we met before?
Somebody told you I was wack? Check the source
Somebody told you I was back? Yes, of course
You got a problem with the fans? There's the door
You lookin' for the old me? Check the morgue, agh!
Not a fortune-teller, but I can see into the future better
Ain't no tellin' what'll happen when I pick up the microphone, get the fans together
Same style, but the songs are better
Been a year and a half, feels like it's gone forever
Ain't no drink in my hand, but you know the buzz is comin'
Big steps in the game, yeah, the Hulk is running
My thoughts are funny, it feels like I'm onto something, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds
I kinda like it up here; I am not comin' down
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds
Which is kinda confusin', I know—been that way since a child
They laugh and they tell me I'll never get out
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else
I don't care what you think, I'm just bein' myself
So I guess for now

[Chorus]
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I guess I don't fit the mold of rap
'Cause I'm respectin' women
I heard your record, I was laughin at it (Ha, ha, ha)
Maybe they would like me more if I got a little graphic with it
Nah, I don't wanna blend in with you little rappin' idiots—I'd rather be the outcast
I ain't never puttin' out trash
I take a hundred and staple it right to my tongue
I always put the money where my mouth's at, agh!
Feels good to be here now
I'm a weird person with a weird crowd
What, you don't like that?
That's cool, that's great, that's fine, okay, you can leave now
Got a weird smile, but I like it though
I paint it on me and I'm walkin' to the microphone
And put the caution tape around me like I did in Intro 1, yeah!
Yeah, they got me reminiscin' now!
Yeah, you done know I'm 'bout to go mad
Never wanted something so bad
Goosebumps through the whole track
Ain't no way I'm gonna hold back
Got me thinkin' that I'm cookin' in a meth lab
I don't blow it up in front of my own eyes
You look a little lost, you ain't get that?
Comin' from a town where nobody is a rapper
Guess I never get the memo, must've missed that
Wow!
Here I go in my feelings again, I can feel it again
So I lay in my bed, in my cell with the pen
And I dwell on my sins, I keep wonderin' when
Time to open the the doors, they don't know who I am
But I pick up the keys and I put on my Timbs
And I stare at the locks and the tat on my skin
And I think to myself, ""I don't wanna fit in""
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm high off the music, my head's in the clouds
I kinda like it up here; I am not comin' down
I'd rather be alone, I am not good in crowds
Which is kinda confusin', I know—been that way since a child
They laugh and they tell me I'll never get out
I'm just tryna be me, I am nobody else

So I guess for now

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast
I guess I'll be the outcast

[Verse 3]
Yeah, tryna focus
Take a knife to my head then I cut it open
Take my brain, put it on the floor—tryna figure out my motives
Y'all thought I was an issue when the door was locked
Nah, you should see me when the door opens
Every night I can hear voices
Put a camera in my face, might turn Joker like I'm Mike Posner
Always been a little complex
Difficult to process
Some of y'all wanna sit around and try to pick apart my bars
Here's some lines you could dissect:
If I'ma die, I'ma die givin' everything that I have
Take a deep breath, I don't need y'all's respect
I'm a reject kid at recess playin' games with his make-believe friends
Yeah, I don't ever take a night off
Lights off in the room and I write songs
I might fall into my thoughts once in a while when the mic's off
You ain't ever seen no drive like mine, better hop outta my car
I'm about to unlock my doors
You ain't got a seat belt on, better find one
Gettin' sick of people tellin' me to smile more
T.S. was a chapter I'll never forget, it was therapy for me
But it's time to turn the page now
Hey, shut up! I'm tryna tell 'em my story!
I'm sorry, I wasn't yellin' at y'all, I was talkin' to the voices
I rip out the drums of the industry's ears for tryin' to ignore me and playin' while singin' this chorus
[Chorus]
I'll just be the outcast
I'll just be the outcast

Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright
I'll be here waiting, I promise I'm changing
I just need...

[Verse 1]
A little time to show you I'm worth it
I know that I can be a difficult person
I'm a stress case, drive you up the wall when I'm workin'
Actually, I'm probably worse when I'm not, you don't deserve it
Make you nervous 'cause you know I'ma break soon
Every time I do, I say somethin' that hurts you
Actin' like I'm gone, but we both in the same room
I don't like to be wrong, which I know you relate to
And I know I make you feel like you're at the end of your rope
That's when I look at you and tell you I'd be better alone
Just the pride talkin', isn't it? 'Cause both of us know
I'm the definition of ""wreck"" if you look into my soul
Comes out the most when I feel I'm in a vulnerable place
Made a lot of mistakes I wish I knew how to erase
When I'm afraid, might get distant and I push you away
But no matter the case, I'ma do whatever it takes even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry
I know everything will be alright

[Verse 2]
Yeah, way before I bought you the ring
We were fighting back and forth like you were wearin' the thing
Two passionate people not afraid to say what they think
Lead to passionate conversation when it's hard to agree
You know me well, sittin' on the edge of my seat
Lookin' at life, overanalyzin' everything
Always depressed, tryna find a better version of me
Searching for somethin' I know's prolly right in front of my feet
Stubborn as me? Maybe not, but you're close to it
Got a lot of issues, I'm tryin' to work through 'em
Going to therapy for you's somethin' that's worth doin'
When I know you been there for me through all of my worst moments
And I know it hurts knowing that I carry this weight on my chest
Making it difficult for me to open up and connect
Lot of regrets, I apologize for all of the stress
That's not what I meant to do, you know I love you to death even if—

[Chorus]
Even if we both break down tonight
And you say you hate me, and we go to bed angry

Yeah, sometimes I wanna disappear like I just don't exist
Or find a time machine and take me back when I was six
Maybe younger, either way, I guess the point of it
Would be to tell that little kid that he's gon' take a lotta hits
Yeah, I'd probably grab your hand and tell you life is hard
If you got questions or you need advice, then talk to God
'Cause He's the only one that listens even when you think He isn't
Even good people are great at makin' bad decisions, yeah (Oh)
They ain't gon' take it serious
You find out pretty quick that life is more than just appearances
I know some things we could avoid to save embarrassment
But everything that breaks you down can also build your character
'Cause people love to see you fail, just be aware of it
Don't let nobody tell you who to be or write your narrative
Look, we're all products of the things that we experience
But there's a big difference between confidence and arrogance
You hearin' this?
I know that you don't get it now, but you gon' get it later
I know you feel like you're alone and no one loves you maybe
And you gon' cover insecurities with lotsa anger
The weird thing is someday all of this will make you famous (Oh)
You start to write about your life and while they're all relatin'
You'll make up a slogan, call it ""Real,"" but feel like you're the fakest
Wish I could tell you that your future's nothin' but amazin'
That's just not the case, and I guess I just don't know how to say this
[Chorus]
I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just want you to know
You gon' make a lotta mistakes
And they gon' laugh in our face
That's part of life, that's just the way that it goes
(That's just the way that it goes)
And I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just need you to get it
I know you been questionin' life
Trust me, I know what it's like
I'm here for you if you need someone to listen
Do you need someone to listen?

[Verse 2]
See, Mom and Dad are not together, they took different routes
But you probably already knew, you gettin' older now
Remember back when Mom picked us up from Grandma's house?
And she hid her boyfriend in the trunk and drove a couple miles?
Down the street, and then she pulled over to let him out
'Cause she ain't want Dad to know she had these type of dudes around
'Cause last time he found out, he had to take us from her
You look uncomfortable, I'm sorry, let me change the subject (Hey)
You know how we've always struggled with abandonment? (Yeah)
And when we feel like someone's leaving, we start panickin'? (Yeah)
And yo, I wish I could say I've learned to manage it
You think it's bad now, but you don't know the half of it
Passion is somethin' we have never lacked
We see it the most when we're writin' raps
They think it's funny now, let 'em laugh
I know you think it's just an outlet when you're really mad
But you don't know the platform you're about to have (Oh)
I know some things about the future you ain't ready for
I know some things that you gon' cover up, but can't ignore
And what hurts is they gon' surface at the worst moments
And we gon' act like it don't hurt us, but it hurts, don't it?
We walk around with the devil talkin' on both shoulders
Wish I could tell you that he disappears when we get older
But that's just not the case, and I know you feel out of place
And everything is not okay, and life can be a lot to take, but…
[Chorus]
I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just want you to know
You gon' make a lotta mistakes
And they gon' laugh in our face
That's part of life, that's just the way that it goes
(That's just the way that it goes)
And I don't know if you can hear me or not
But if you can, I just need you to get it
I know you been questionin' life
Trust me, I know what it's like
I'm here for you if you need someone to listen
Do you need someone to listen?

[Verse 3]
You know how intoxicated people make us nervous?
To the point sometimes we shake and it feels so disturbin'
Don't be scared, that's just trauma tryna reach the surface
And tell us everyone we love is gonna try to hurt us
Which isn't true, but it's a lie that both of us believe in
Yeah, you might get a glimpse of happiness from your achievements
But what you'll learn as you get older, every time you reach one
Is you'll just make another goal that doesn't lead to freedom
See, some things about to happen that you can't imagine
At 24, you'll drop an album, and you'll call it Mansion
At 25, you'll put out Therapy and gain some traction
Skip to track number four, now that's a really sad one
Yeah, Perception's coming next, we 'bout to reach the masses
It sounds awesome; at the same time, it doesn't matter
At 27, we'll make millions, but it's really sad 'cause
You learn to realize that none of this will make you happy
[Outro]
I wish that I could look at you with empathy
Sometimes I feel like I've become what you were scared to be
Which makes it really hard to look at you with sympathy
'Cause if I'm feeling bad for you, then I have to feel bad for me
And that's just something I feel like we don't deserve
That's why I'm always looking down on you, I know it hurts
I'm sure you have a lot of questions
I've been tryna search to find us both some answers
I'll be here for you if things get worse

If you think that I'm 'bout to change who I am just for you then you're so wrong
As a kid I built a house around my broke heart
Sometimes you don't know what you had until it falls apart, till it falls apart

Yeah, I had to think smart
Threw away the deck and got my own cards
Long before I had the money to afford a car

[Chorus 2]
I (yeah)–I've been doin' me (Oh, yeah)
I've been doin' me
Yeah, I've been doin' me (I have been)
I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I've been doin' me (Followin' my)
I've been doin' me
I've been doin' me (I've been followin' my)
Yeah, I've been doin' me
Followin' my dreams
Yeah, I'm just doin' me
Yeah, I'm just doin' me
[Verse 3]
Yeah, I'm reminiscin' back to both of us laughin'
Playin' old records, thinkin' every one of 'em's classic
Windows down, we on the street up in Michigan rappin'
We talked about it, but never really knew it could happen
My confidence about as low as the gas is
We didn't have the money for it, so we'd turn the key backwards and sit in parking lots for hours till the battery crashes
I think that we related 'cause both of us were lookin' for answers
A couple months ago I drove into Gladwin, got me all in my feelings
It's somethin' 'bout bein' somewhere that's familiar
Pull in the gas station, open up the tank then I fill it then laugh
Would I move back? Mm, not in a million, but I appreciate the memories we had
I know you've been callin', sorry I never call back
I know I've been distant, you know I never meant that
You can tell the family how I'm doing if they ask
I'm just doin' me68Embed"

[Verse 1: NF]
Yeah, I know the person in the mirror's not a perfect one
I look at him every day and think he's not enough
My life's a book that I don't really like to open up
I'm twenty-six, but I feel like I live in chapter one
I skim through it, I've been through it, they laugh at us
You think it's funny, yeah, laugh it up
I always felt like no one listened to me, that's how I grew up
Church is where I found God, but it's also where I learned to judge
Yeah, I had to learn there's a difference between
What you want, and what you really need
I've always been motivated by comments from people tellin' me things they think I'll never be
And then I become it, this is my everything
There's so much that goes on in my head that people will never see
You probably be terrified of my memories, don't lecture me
Let me be, let me see, let me breathe, how they remember me
Doesn't alter who I am as a person to take my energy, yeah

[Verse 2: NF]
Yeah, my fans made me who I am, but they also deceived me
I've been allowed to live life like I'm already grieving
I'm at a table of liars but don't eat what they feed me
My hoodie over my face, so nobody can see me
I'm on a plane, 'bout to fly again
Looking out the window, take a moment to admire it
Wondering how high it is, wonder where the time has went
Then I shut the window and go back to feeling like I'm out my mind again, agh!
Yeah, seems like we're all trying to climb a ladder
It's crazy what we'll do to climb it faster
It's like we throw away the things in life that really matter
Just so we can make it to the top and wonder what we're even climbing after
I know the feeling of feeling like everything that you deal with
Don't never change, that's part of being a human, yeah
Life's what you make of it, take it, embrace it, and take it, and savor it
Ain't about what you did, it's what you became from it, agh!
[Chorus: Ruelle & NF]
Hard days, cold nights

But I don't feel nothin', I wonder why?
I'm in the race of life and time passed by
Look, I sit back and I watch it
Hands in my pockets
Waves come crashin' over me, but I just watch 'em
I just watch 'em
I'm underwater but I feel like I'm on top of it

Focus on it every single day, I wanna figure out a way
To get ahead of what I think I know is comin'
It's obvious you got a problem if you always tryna make it seem
As if you've never been afraid, then why you runnin'?
I could never look at what I do the way that other people can
And walk away, I can't be separated from it
Stickin' out my neck is how I made it where I'm at
You wanna cut it up but can't, man, they can never take it from me
(I'm) Outlandish, take chances
Gotta get it while I can with my damage
My sanity could leave but if it vanished
Don't matter to me, I'd still manage
Gue-guеss you could say I'm at an advantage
My vantage point can be quitе lavish
Got so many cadences, no way to pick
One, which bag is my hand in
Depends what mood I'm in
Oh, no, I'm in a mood again
Lord knows I'm a hooligan
Losin' it, who can get gruesome with
You if it comes down to what you can bet?
I shoot direct, defuse the threat
And they wonder why the music has a huge effect?
Could it be 'cause I've been the go-to when it comes to depth?
'Cause I'm the one that they be callin' when the people get fed up
And want the music with the visuals, I got a vendetta
For any part of me that wanna make it hard to get set up
And take away the happiness, it can be kinda pathetic
But when I look at everything that's tryna give me a headache
I gotta be honest, I really been the cause of it, get it
'Cause I can see a side of me you'll never see, you can tell
When I'm at the breakin' point, I finally had to sit with the devil
I went into hell and I asked him what the problem is, yellin'
He tried to get me to live with him, even called me a sinner
And told me everything about me doesn't feel like a winner
So why continue when he's tellin' me I might as well give up?
I took a moment, thought about it, feelin' caught in the middle
But got offended when he told me I would live in a kennel
And I can never leave it, even if I made it to Heaven
He'd find a way to get me back and send a demon to get me
I'm like, ""Woah (Woah), hold up, I don't think so""
Skin and bones meet my ego
How's he look? He don't eat much
Let him starve, I don't feed him
I just beat him, I just leave him in his womb, in the fetal
Let him cry, let him yell, let him scream, I don't need him
Lift off when I'm ticked off, my pitfalls I latch on to like a pit dog
I sit calm with a sick thought of a sitcom of the life I live
Life I live's more like a sci-fi flick
I hide in, wanna watch? Dive right in
My silence doesn't mean I'm dyin'
Just means I'm careful with the time I spend, so
[Chorus: NF]
(Look, look) Look what I, look what I done (Ayy)
Helpin' the people I love (I love)
My life is not what it was (No)

Everyone knowin' that I'm a death bringer
That lingua vexing ya
Leavin' a regular rapper resting, bruh (Chyeah)
This is what, I give it such
An incredible wicked rush, a vivid gush
Of poetical livid stuff to rid his gruff
Said, I better go rip it rough and I lit it up
The prestige I gather from people lovin' the Tech speed (Whoop)
Lyrically elect me, Jet Li
The beat, it got ya bobbin' until your neck bleed (Whoop)
That is tellin' me ""Let's feed""
On the bitter the bogus the hitter will focus
Deliver the doses and give a critter the dopest
Spitter to flow sick and now the quitter corrosive
A swig of the roguish'll give your liver cirrhosis (Chyeah)
The boogie monster reppin' with NF in the hoodie
Want to step into the session and fully conquer
The weapon to lessen our profession go bully bonkers (Chyeah)
Left in a wreck, never checkin' nor could he stomp us
Take his crown
Thought he was gonna make us run away in a battle with his fakeish frown
Shake his ground

These flows are the cheat code for the weak Joes
That need those elite bros with the heat, so
They can eat on the D low
Off a beast yo' ego, got it vetoed (Chyeah)

Taken from me, thieves chose to try to decode (Chyeah)

What is perfect? Not me
I've been overworkin' for weeks
I go home then purchase some things
That I know will not fill my needs
Have a dose of what I've achieved
Then get lonesome and I critique
Who I am and what I believe
Make up standards too high to reach
Untrained animal off the leash
I'm in panic, but yet relieved
Brought your hammock to hang with me?
Grab a hatchet, cut down your tree
Like a mannequin that can speak
What I have in store is unique
I just mop the floors with MCs
I can't stop until things are clean
I'm an amateur's what you think
So you stand there in disbelief
'Til I dislocate both your feet
That's what happens, you step to me
Not too graphic, but not PG
Lots of action in every scene
I'm kidnapping all of your dreams
Hold 'em hostage and watch 'em scream (Ahh!)
Rap aside, I am what I advertise
Don't matter how you put it, we live, then we have to die
You might hate it, but you can't deny
See, everything that I've been doing got me lookin' like a mastermind
It's so vain, but I vandalize that I do what you fantasizin'
Took a vision of my dreams
And then found a better way that I can make it
I've been looking, think I'm really 'bout to maximize it (Agh!)
These bullets form in my mind and come out my mouth and (Pow, pow, pow)
For anyone out there doubting or acting mouthy (Watch, watch, watch)
Forget what you heard about me, I've been astounding (Got, got, got)
Something for you thinking you might run circles 'round me
Yeah, ain't this all I ever wanted?
That's a fact, no, that's a lie, no
I'm confused, yeah, I got problems
What's the use? Yeah, let's be honest
Screws are loose, I need 'em tightened
Not amused, yeah, look what I did
Brought you something, hope you like it
So precise, the flow the nicest
So productive, stop your whining
Back in style like I was vinyl
I make songs and they go viral
Something's off if I go idle
""Been so long,"" yeah, okay, I know
Take your shoes off, you're in my home
You got fans, but not like I do, yeah (I do, I do)
Thankful, I try to be, can't contain what's inside of me
They don't like this side of me 'cause I lack in compliancy
I question what I can see if you're not playing my CD
No expiring, I'll decide when I think it's my time to leave (Woo)
Yeah, 'cause they won't retire me, it inspires me to be inspiring
When I'm low I feel like I'm spiraling
Pushin' forward, look, I can't ignore it
There ain't no I in team, but drop the T and A
Sometimes, if I'm bein' honest, feels like it's only me
No defeat, notably, better have it right if you're quoting me
Write my name on your hit list, it might be the last time you wrote something
Rip that cocky smile right off your face for thinking you're close to me
Grab a can of gasoline, light it all over your self-esteem
Selfishly watching y'all helplessly pretend you're on my planet
Shoot you out of the sky like you're punchlines, you are not landin'
Gun jammin', reach in your mouth and rip out your tongue after tongue
Lashings, I hand 'em out like pamphlets in church, Pastor
Show up to my funeral wearin' all black, and what's happenin'?
I look around and wonder, ""Where my fans at?""
Oh Lord, they know me so well, they know I'm not in that casket
Trash bag is prolly buried somewhere full of my ashes
My music's superb, playin' with words, play with my nerves
They gon' have a list of issues long as my shirts
Very absurd, very disturbed
Stare at the Earth like, ""This is not the place I was birthed""
I'm generic, you sure?
Oh, they think I'm very reserved
'Til I open up on the beat like on my Therapy work
I don't care what you heard, real scary, carry the verse
While I'm wearin' my merch, stompin' on your arrogant turf
Sit back and observe, nah, I like to actually work
This life's so unpredictable, it just keeps pitching me curves
I take a swing, I hate the things that make me feel like I'm dirt
I've patiently been waitin', please, I think it's time for my turn
My expertise are melodies, they talk to me when I'm hurt
Just let me be, eventually someday they'll see what I'm worth

I'm waitin' for that call sayin' records are not selling

It's strange the way the mind can wander, but also stop to gossip
And chat with memories that you and me aren't really fond of
Maybe you're out to find love, maybe you lost who you was
Maybе you're just like me and feel thе need to stay in your rut
'Cause if you left it, you might feel like you're no longer you
It's so impressive, the way the mind can play with the truth
It's interestin' that nobody can walk in your shoes
But still relate and feel the same, so in a way, guess we do
You ever think about what it would be like
If the clouds were gone and you could see light?
If the door was open, would you take flight
Or just close the curtains up and stay inside?
Take a walk with me, take a risk with me
I'm scared too and it gets so tempting
When you're so empty, to disown everything
You hold dearly when you know clearly
You been so buried in your own fairytale
The soul's tearin' bunch of holes in me
I relate to it, but in case you been
Thinkin' no one does, here's a great theory
Throw a Hail Mary, let ya mind fly
To the sun rise, could be so scary
Make your faith vary, feel the pain glaring
But the weight carried ain't in vain, hear me? (Hear me?)
[Chorus]
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you

[Verse 2]
So often I feel desperate, I think my heart's infected
How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? How 'bout yours? I guess if
You feel the best when your life is hectic, you might be destined
To stay defective, so join the club, it ain't that hard to get in
It's hard to leave though, look at the guest list
I bet that your name is on it, don't believe me? Check it
See dead ends
In life we come to tend to raise some questions
Suggestion
Know that your feelings might give wrong directions (Infested)
Yeah, with the feeling of failure
Let it take over your body, it makes ya
Question the life that you have, situations
You might have enjoyed become nothin' but dated
Old and forgotten, but what would you say if
I told you that there was some hope we could make it?
I know what you're thinkin', I'm thinkin' it too
Could you really improve and be somethin' worth savin'?
See, I could pretend like I have all the answers
But none of us do, it's the reason we battle
Convincing yourself that you don't really matter's
Like feedin' a cancer and letting it travel
To every part of you, but what if we did
The unthinkable and cancel our trips?
What's achievable depends on the risk
So pick up your chin and listen to this
[Chorus]
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you (You, you, you, you)

[Bridge]
Yeah, everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the rainy days that give us love for the sun
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' it does, oh yeah
Everybody falls sometimes
Just remember that that's alright
It's the lows in life that make you cherish the highs
And if it isn't, I guess I'll be fine believin' a lie (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Just in case my car goes off the highway
Or the plane that I get on decides that it's my last day
I want you to know when you're alone and you feel afraid
You're not the only person in the world that isn't okay
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you
Just like you, like you
There's millions of us just like you, like you, like you

Mm, mm
Mm, mm

[Verse 1]
I miss the days when I had a smile on my face and
Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things
Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone
And wasn't so cautious and always exhausted
And actually listened to things that my heart said, heart said
Ridin' my bike, just ridin' my bike
Not overthinkin' my life
Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person
Or someone that nobody likes
Not always stressed about money or losin' my job
Or scared I ain't makin' a flight
Not always goin' to bed every night
With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds
What happened to me? Yeah, what happened to me?
When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it
Then question my purpose to breathe?
Wonderin' who I should be
Happiness out of my reach
Scared to get back on my feet
Need to get rid of what's detrimental, but it's hard to let go
When the thing that hurts you help you get to your dreams
See, I miss the days when I wasn't so faded
Love wasn't always invasive, I could embrace it
Just innocent, waitin', not always livin' in anguish
When did I break and become overtaken?
What was the moment I caved and
Gave away all of my faith and made a replacement?
I miss the days when, I miss the days when—
[Chorus]
I miss the smiles we had when we were young (Oh)
I miss the memories of feeling love (Oh)
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun (Oh)
Staring out the window when the rain would come (Oh)
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah (Oh)
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah (Oh)
When we had joy and we were innocent (Oh)
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again

[Verse 2]
Give me my mind back, yeah
Give me my mind back
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I fall flat
Yeah, fall flat
The one that told me I was worth somethin' when I'm off track
Back when my imagination wasn't in a cage and it was free to run fast
Yeah, give me my mind back
Yeah, give me my, give me my mind back
Before it was hijacked and wasn't described as
A place of limitation, always indicating I can't
Handle everything from my past
Handed anything it dissects 'til I'm depressed
I know I'm blessed, but I'm cursed too
Take me back when I was happy, but I wasn't actin'
Vulnerable but didn't see it like some kind of weakness
Or a thing that's unattractive
Had emotion, but I learned to mask it
Didn't know what I was runnin' after
Didn't know the older I would grow
The more I'd lose control and take in all the baggage
It's really sad when everything you thought was stable crashes
Everything you thought would take the sadness
Really only made it deeper, got me off the deep end askin'
Will we ever feel like we imagine?
Will we ever feel like we adapted?
Will we ever feel like we did back then?
Just take me back when, just take me back when
[Chorus]
I miss the smiles we had when we were young (Oh)
I miss the memories of feeling love (Oh)
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun (Oh)

I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah (Oh)
When we had joy and we were innocent (Oh)

So I'll breathe it in, I'll breathe it in

[Verse 1: NF]
I heard that pictures don't change
Just the people inside of 'em do
Whoever told you that life would be easy
I promise that person was lyin' to you
You got a problem with followin' through
That's why I got a problem with followin' you
You keep lookin' at me like this problem is new
But we've been here before, what you tryin' to do?
Don't talk to me like I don't know what you're feeling
'Cause I was there with you back in the beginning
Quit looking away when I talk, let me finish
I'm tryna be honest, you're tryna forget me, ugh
What's wrong with you, hey?
I know that you got a lot on your plate
You keep telling me I should get out of your way
But I can't see how you gon' lie to my face
Don't tell me you're fine
'Cause I know you're not, so don't even try it
And what? We gon' live in this life full of pain
'Til we're eighty and one day we'll get up and say we regretted our lives?
'Cause that's where we're going
And do not pretend like you don't even notice
The funny thing is that you already know it
I'm starting to think that you like how it feels to be lost in the moment
[Chorus: Andreas Moss]
Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

[Verse 2: NF]
Yeah, they told us that time flies, didn't know what it means
Now I feel like we're just running around tryna
Catch it and hoping to cut off its wings
But that ain't gon' happen
Joy, when was the last time we had it?
I don't remember 'cause all that we do
Is go backwards, but that's what you get
When you live in the past
And I know we're breathing but we're not alive
Really, is this the way we wanna die?
'Til you got everything bottled inside
If they only knew what goes on in our minds
I know what you're thinking so don't try to hide
Why do you look at me like you surprised?
If you really mean what you write in these lines
Then why don't you fix it, 'cause I'm getting tired!
Yeah, I can no longer do this
Ever since you fell in love with the music
See? You find a way to express what you feel
But the moment that you get away from the mic, you don't know what you're doing
Is it clear to you yet?
I don't know what's going on in your head
But eventually, you'll have to deal with the things
That you talk about yeah, but I guess until then, we're lost!
[Chorus: Andreas Moss]
Lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment
And get lost, lost in the moment
Lost in the moment, lost in the moment

Both of us have got a past, but it's alright
All night car rides
Drivin' through the city, yeah, the view's fantastic
It's automatic, could see you smile, gotta have it
She got me thinkin' maybe I'ma have to put a ring on it, girl
I ain't never been a romantic, but I can romance ya
Get your shoes on, baby, I am not asking
I'm 'bout to take you out to dinner, put the black dress on
Got the room gaspin', how did this happen?
I don't even know
She's the type to sing my words at the show
She's the type to pick me up when I'm low
And remind me she got my back, no matter what
Yeah, I think she hearin' me now
Say what I think, so I'm thinkin' out loud
I need a woman I know I can trust, and I got one
I guess you can say that she down

Talk to you with my hands tied
Walk towards you on a fine line
Everybody has a dark side
I feel embarrassed when they see mine
Rain falling from my dark skies
Clouds parting, but it's all lies
Shouldn't I see the sunshine now?
Wonder how I look in God's eyes
Am I a good person or a lost one?
Will this feel worth it when I'm all done?
Will I feel ashamed or like who I was?
Will the pain vanish or will more come?
Will I stay numb or regain love?
Maybe someday have a taste of freedom?
Will I take the poison out of my blood?
Or just leave it there inside of my lungs?
I know (Know, know)
I should let you go, hands are feeling cold
Just leave me alone (No, no, no)
I just want control, I feel so exposed
Liars in my home (No, no, no)
Please do not provoke, noose around my soul, I cut down a rope
They don't want me happy, they don't want me fixed
They don't want me better, they just want me broke
Talk but never listen, at least I admit it
Block out all my vision, watchin' me diminish
That's my favorite pastime, I know nothing different
Tell me something different, I don't see the difference
I just feel offended, I just feel defensive
Why don't you accept me? I just need acceptance
Time is of the essence, don't like how we spend it
You just want perfection, I need you to let me

Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go
Let me go, let me go, let me go, let me go

Why'd you say I don't belong here? (Huh?)
Fill a bucket full of my tears (Huh?)
Pouring out the water, all of my insecurities whenever I'm scared
I watch 'em grow and say I don't care
I pray to God to ask if hope's real
And if it is, then I was thinking maybe You could introduce us, we ain't met still
Yeah, my chest feels like a blade's in it
Who put it there? I think they did it
Out the cell now, where am I headed?
Am I Hell-bound? Will I find Heaven?
Will I feel better or just regret it?
If I let you go and find the seven letters
I've been looking for, it's like it's never endin'
Open all the doors and let the peace enter
I'm (So, so, so)
Pitiful at times, miserable inside
They want me to hide (No, no, no)
How can I survive? Change your state of mind?
I should say goodbye (No, no, no)
They want me to beg, they want me to plead, they want me to die
They just want me dead, they just want me hurt
Don't want me to live, don't want me alive
Stop with the pretending, I don't feel respected
I just feel rejected, I don't like rejection
You promise protection, I don't feel protected
I just feel neglected, how can I respect it?
I'll teach them a lesson, I pick up the weapon
Aim in your direction, shoot at my reflection
Shatter my perception, hate it when I'm desperate

Don't be the one to insult my integrity

Y'all don't know nothing, you think you ejected me
'Til I show up in the game, like, ""Remember me?""
I gotta make it, these people depend on me
Ayy, that's how I'm living these days
Threaten my wife, keep digging that grave
I had a job making minimum wage
Told myself that I gotta get paid
Prove myself, yeah, get up my grades
Walk into class like, ""Gimme that A""
Think I'm trash? Put a bag in your face
And I put you by the road like, ""Look, we're the same!""
Here's a reminder that I still spit
Think I need to advise you to watch your lip
Or at least realize that I'm not no kid
Don't Google my name tryna find my crib
Write a pop song, then I write a song like this
Do a lot wrong? Doesn't matter, I learn quick
I'm an outlaw, my brain has no fence
Doesn't matter either way to me 'cause even if it did
I would destroy it (Woo, woo, woo)
Used to be employee, now I'm employer
Making big deals, now I gotta get lawyers
People tell me to relax and enjoy it
But when I kick back, I see warnings
So much time might pass, can't ignore it
Every time I rap and I'm recording
Might be my last so I absorb it 'cause

If I ain't got the bars, you see
Something ain't right like I'm incomplete
Outcast, yes, I'm a different breed
If you disagree, make 'em all retreat
Act like a boss when I compete
Take my thoughts into hyperspeed
When it's all gone and I hit my peak
At least I'll know that I took that leap
'Cause life is a process
And I am not here for the nonsense
Losing everything I worked for likes to weigh on my conscience
That why I block out the comments
Who's next? Who's next?
I don't know, I ain't been watching
Closing my ear to the gossip
I gotta make it or make it
Man, these are the options, ooh
No forfeit, my course different
Changed flows and I'm bored with it
More livid, never more driven, I avoid timid
Try to tell me I could never be the G.O.A.T. of rap, I ignore limits
I was born with this, you're trippin' thinkin' I'm slippin'
I'm enjoying this
Look at me, I'm on the tour selling more tickets
Even if the fourth record didn't sell a copy, I'ma do it like a hobby

All I ever wanted was somebody to hear me
And all I ever wanted was somebody to feel me
And everybody wanna tell me that I'm out of my head
When I'm on the mic, that's fine, but that don't scare me
It's been a long time, but I'm back now
Rap pow, welcome to the rap house
Rap pow, will live 'til I pass out
Blackout, blackout, everybody keep on wonderin' if I still rap now
Are you serious?
Anybody out there hearin' this?
Yo, I came in the game as a lyricist
And I'ma leave like that, period
You sniff lines, I write lines
You've now entered in my mind
And you better get ready cause you might find
I'm from a different place, and my kind
It's a little bit different than yours is
Quit snoring, hip-hop isn't dead
It's just been in mournin'
From the moment I quit recording
Quick, record this
Listen, I'm warming up and you're misinformed if
You think that I'm slipping up, this ain't sick enough
Then I'll skip the chorus
I've been here, ain't nobody heard of me?
Yeah I'ma turn this beat to a murder scene
I don't live for the world
I live for the King, I live for the King, focus
Wrote this with emotion
It's hard to get a break when the doors ain't open
It's hard to get a shot when the gun ain't loaded
And it's hard to make a living when nobody wanna notice, hold it
What am I insane maybe? Plain crazy
You put me in a room with a mic you will not restrain me
You do what you wanna but you can't contain me, lazy
Is not a character trait of mine, don't wait in line
This is the current condition of my state of mind
[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have

[Verse 2]
All I ever wanted was somebody to get this
All I ever wanted was somebody to play this
Yeah, take my song, put it on their playlist
And get goosebumps every time they play it, rate us
If that's my calling or not, Father, maybe I should just not bother
Go back to that nine-to-five, but I am not a quitter so quit that
I never been a killer but I guarantee I kill tracks
Put them in a coffin, lost in, rip that
Tryin' to make an impact in rap, is that insane?
Well, I guess so
Rap though, better give me that pencil
And you ain't ever gonna make it, it's all mental
I am in a place where I can't let go, agh!
I still work a job and do this, and y'all know what's stupid?
I thought all you had to do was get a record deal, and, your things start moving
But that's not the case, because most of the times—the artists you hear
You keep on thinking that artist is new, but that artist has prolly been at it for years
Yeah, in the back of my mind thinking, am I wasting my time dreamin'?
And I ain't got no money in my wallet, but I guarantee there ain't no way that I am gonna leave this
I need this, I swear to y'all, I need this
And this hip-hop's in my veins, if you cut me I'ma bleed it
And, yo, what you think I write raps for? No reason? No
Take my pain and I put 'em in a song—ever since them pills, they took my mom
I've been a different person, don't try to predict my verses
What you're hearing now is me whether I'm in front or behind that curtain
I stand behind these words and, I'm a Christian but I'm not perfect
Don't tell me to calm down, I'm calm now, listen, I'm just working
Yeah, it might take a minute to get it, but once you get it everything will be crystal clear
I don't think they see my vision here, I don't think they see my vision here!
[Chorus]
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel
This is all I have, all I have
Don't tell me that this isn't real
Don't tell me this ain't how I feel

You got me thinking things I never used to
I'm not the phone type, I'd rather be with you
Sometimes I hold back from saying, ""I miss you""
But I miss you
I have to admit, on this road I get lonely
But you make me smile every time that you call me
You let me be myself
You don't control me

Laying in my bed, I'm just staring at the ceiling, baby
I just wanna know if you can feel what I'm feeling, baby
Got you on my mind yeah, tell me what the deal is lately
Yeah, deal is lately, deal is lately
I'm a man of my word, girl believe that
I'm a closed book but somehow you learn to read that
Know that I should relax, hate the way I react
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Thinking that I'm good but you know I'm 'bout to relapse
Girl I wake up in the morning', all I can think of is you

Yeah, look

[Verse 1]
I mean this with love when I say it
I wanna answer the phone when you call me
The problem is, it's 10 a.m. and you're already drinkin'
You're probably already wasted
What's the point in having conversation with somebody that
Won't remember we had conversations, yeah, we always talk about the same things, we just say 'em different
Try to fix it, crazy, isn't it?
You say, ""Mom was always proud"" and played the videos of us as kids, I get it
I think that both of us live in the past, so we take for granted the present
Maybe next time I'm in Michigan, I'll come and visit
We ain't got a lot in common but both of us miss her
We could sit inside your smoke-filled livin' room, and tear up together, that's real

[Chorus]
I might do some things you don't like
We all make mistakes, that's just life
They might say I changed, that's alright
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (That's just my)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life, my life, my)

[Verse 2]
You know my patience is very thin
Wish I was there again
I'm not embarrassed to say that we've always had issues
I'm embarrassed to say that we never took care of 'em, yeah
Pain will always find its way to the surface
No matter how deep you bury him
Growin' up, I felt like no one ever really got me, eventually
I took that out on relationships (Woo!)
I put my arm around you, and I mean it, I love you to death
These are the moments I know I'ma always hold onto and cherish 'em, yeah
Life's about taking chances, making moves
Not about what you did, it's what you do
Build on what you got and learn from what you lose
And never let people distract you from being you

[Chorus]
I might do some things you don't like (Yeah)
We all make mistakes, that's just life (Life)
They might say I changed, that's alright (That's alright)
That's alright, that's alright
That's just my life, my life, my life, my life (My life, my life)

Yeah (Haha)
My name buzzin', ain't no way you could ignore it
I did not come this far so they could ignore me
I am not the one to say, ""I'll do it in the mornin'""
I'd rather get it done, don't focus on what's not important
They try to talk to me like they been nothin' but supportive
Appreciate the love, but do not show up on my doorstep
If you ain't about that real, I suggest that you avoid me
If we ain't on the same page, that's the end of story, agh!
You are not a baller 'cause your closet's full of Jordan's
You are not a rich man 'cause you're on the Forbes list
First, I drop the record, then you know I gotta tour it
Real's still the slogan, only difference is there's more of us
The story of my life feels like it's just beginnin' now
I ask you a question, I want answers, not the run-around
You the one that brought it up, but I'm the one to shut it down
If you ain't got the album yet, I brought you one, I'm at your house
Hey!

Yeah
I know where I'm goin', I don't let no one distract me
I don't need directions from nobody in the back seat
I don't need these people in my corner tryna gas me
I'd rather have people in my corner tryna check me
Yeah, I walk off the bus a different city than the last week
Let the fans speak, they gon' tell you 'bout the past me
If I'm bein' honest, last year I was in a bad place
Wouldn't say I'm out of it, but don't feel like I can't be, agh!
Who you know droppin' clean records, but they nasty?
I was made for this, I could tell when Mama had me
I hopped right off the table, told my doctor, ""I ain't average.""
He asked me, ""What does that mean?""
I told him, ""Get the pen and pad, please.""
Who'd a known I'd write something that could change lives?
I don't think y'all fully understand the way you changed mine
I look at the future that's in front of me with both eyes
Three records, three years, I don't like to waste time
Oh yeah!

I'm dedicated, the definition of dedication
Wrote this whole record while I was levitating
Sittin' in my room with the pen and paper, I'm innovative
They've been afraid of me since I was a second grader
I'm the kid on the playground mama told you to never play with
There's levels of music—and I'm in the elevator
Going up to the top floor, look how we elevated
What, you don't know the brand by now? You better get educated
Take both of my arms, rip 'em out the sockets and separate 'em
Forgive me, yeah, I know I get animated
Don't matter, I still write a better record than yours without a hesitation
Never been more motivated
Just look at all the minds I have opened and penetrated
See, I am the voice of all these kids that think things, but never say 'em
That's why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like we're carrying weapons, ah!
Put the controllers away, it's game over
I promise I'm way colder
The fans keep saying that they're hungry for new music
Well that's pretty convenient 'cause I just made a plate for 'em
And I don't hear what none of y'all are saying
I just sit at the keys feeling the music
Got me thinking I'm Beethoven
The game needs a makeover
If you've been waiting, the wait's over
You ain't notice, y'all about to witness a takeover, I'm home!
Yeah, they waiting on me to match the
Emotion that I had in the last one
What if I don't, they gon' tell me that I'm losing my passion?
If I do, am I repeating my actions?
Yeah, look, ""How Could You Leave Us"" is massive
There ain't nothing I can write that'll match that
My biggest fear writing this record wasn't putting out trash
It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
Now I want you to picture me:
I'm in a hotel rapping, crying on the floor of the bathroom
Staring in the mirror, my room, hands shaking playing ""How Could You Leave Us"" through the speakers on my iPhone
Tryna figure out if I'ma always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
Or maybe I can't be, 'cause if the music ain't emotional enough, are they gon' call me a has-been?
Pain's always been the root of my music
If I cut it off, how am I supposed to keep growing
If I let it go, won't my whole career be in ruins?
That's when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
I never cared to impress people that don't even know me
I just write what I feel, somehow it started a movement
Trying to enjoy a career, but I don't know how to do it
When I spend all of my time being afraid I'ma lose it!
But, then I figured out the reason they follow me
The reason why these fans surrounding me
It's not 'cause I'm a ""Rap God""
I don't need you people to bow to me
All they ever did was doubt on me, now everyone's proud of me
Acknowledge me or not, you ain't ignoring the following
I'm just teaching 'em something they couldn't learn in they colleges
This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives, feels like it's darker than Halloween!
Yeah, you ain't alone out there, look around you—we got a lot of fans in here
Couple hundred thousand, that's what we did last year
Listen to Intro III, trying to kill my fear
They'll get that in a minute
We about to shatter the critics
I am a savage, admit it
A lot of baggage I live in
That's why the passion is different
Really don't care if they get it
We're only three records in it and this is just the beginning
I'm home!

When I die, put my ashes in a trash bag
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder…

[Chorus]
""Do You see us down here, oh Lord?"" (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)
Do You see us down here, oh Lord? (Oh Lord) Oh Lord? (Oh Lord)

Yeah, everybody wants change
Don't nobody wanna change though
Don't nobody wanna pray

[Verse 3]
It's easy to blame God but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like, ""Why ain't You listening?""
Watchin' the news in our livin' rooms on the big screens
And talkin' about, ""If God's really real, then where is He?"" (Is He, is He…)
You see the same God that we're sayin' might not even exist
Becomes real to us but only when we're dyin' in bed
When you're healthy, it's like we don't really care for Him then
""Leave me alone God. I'll call You when I need You again."" (Need You again)
Which is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like He's sleepin' on you
We turn our backs on Him; what do you expect Him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's prayin' to you (Prayin' to you)
I look around at this world we walk on (Walk on)
It's a smack in the face; don't ever tell me there's no God (No God)
And if there isn't, then what are we here for?
And what are y'all doin' down there? I don't know, Lord, ah!

[Verse 1]
Slippin' through my fingertips (Ayy), lingerin'
Shoulda, woulda, coulda, where'd I put the pen? (Woah)
Make a list of all my failed attempts
Runnin' out of space again
Highlight all the things I wish I never said (Stop)
If feeling makes you stronger, I'm the weakest
That would mean that I would have to separate from my beliefs
It's not a secret, I'm a puzzle, got a lot of missin' pieces
Underneath this strong persona I put on's a kid that's screamin'
Aren't these waters so decеivin'? (So deceivin')
They look diffеrent, don't they?
Well, at least that's how they seem to me
'Cause we just drift and drift and drift
Until we see something that we define as peaceful
Grab the needle, shoot reminders in my veins
That people leave you while I'm driftin'

Lots of gossip, I've been watchin' you
How you're talkin' to yourself is rude
Driftin' I'm in the same boat as you
Sinkin', dreamin', screamin' for some truth
And (My, my) escalator's broke, I'll take the stairs, I guess
Climb until I'm outta breath
Questioning my every step (Woah)
My train of thought is leadin' me to different tracks
Positive that where I'm at is not where I should stay and that's (Why)
Told you look into the mirror and say, ""I love you""
Convince yourself that no one in the world would ever want to
Passin' by the people that have been there to support you
From the get-go, disrespectful, drive you mental
Might get stressful when I'm driftin'
I see you in the distance
Askin' me why I'm so distant, I'm convicted
I'm convinced that I predict that all my wishes on my wish list won't be heard
'Cause I'm committed to the lie that feeling safe is unrealistic

Ignorant to my ignorance
Tell me I'm worth it, God
Give me the faith to rise and help me diversify
To take a step forward, immersed in my belligerence, amplified
The feelings and words collide
Intensified by living a life deprived
I'd rather be burned alive
Than go back to thinkin' I'm insignificant (Insignificant)
Every impotent moment debated can trigger it
God is my witness definitive
Holdin' my head up, there isn't an innocent bone in my body

""Don't nobody else wanna listen""
When's the last time you saw me?

'Cause that was back then, you were different
I don't wanna hear the sorries
I'm tired of all the talkin'
To be honest, I would rather see a difference
Yeah, you pass me in the hallway
But you ain't say a word to me

Woke up in a bad place
Should probably get up, so I'm not late
Stared at my phone for the past eight
Minutes at nothin', my head aches
Bottles empty by the lampshade
I'm out of Excedrin again, great
Too early to tell, but at this rate
I'm thinkin' this might be a bad day
I walk out the bedroom, my roommate's
Asleep on the couch with her two-faced
Boyfriend who lives here, but don't pay
A penny for rent, but he still stays
She says he's broke, I'm like, ""No way""
Probably sells drugs, but she won't say
Told me he dabbles in real estate
I mean I don't believe it, but okay
Okay, pull out the driveway
Notice my gas tank's on E again, well, of course, it is
Guess I probably should stop at the gas station
So I take a right, pull up to the pump
While it's pumpin', I look at my ashtray
Then remember I need to get cigarettes (Cigarettes)
Anything to help my mind state
So, I park and walk inside—wait!
I should probably get somethin' to drink and eat, I guess
So I find and grab a couple bags of chips
Where's the candy aisle? Oh, yeah, here it is
Which one should I get? Should I grab the Starburst or
Change it up and maybe grab the Twix?
Mm, grab the Starburst, then I started walkin'
As I pass the garbage and I reach the fridge
I hear someone yellin' at the front of the store
Probably just a homeless guy getting bored
Probably just a customer whose card
Didn't work, and now he wants to start a war
Man, I can't afford to
Keep buyin' energy drinks everyday, I shut the door, then
Turn around and as I'm headin' towards the counter
With my drink, I hear, ""Hey, open up the drawer""
Crouching on the floor
Peek around the aisle, gun is on the fore-
Head of the man that's behind the counter
Now my heart is poundin' and I'm prayin' to the Lord
I don't die today, I can't die today
I got things to do, tryin' not to shake
Plotting my escape, where's my cellphone at?
Left it in my car, icing on the cake
I start crawling, I can hear 'em yellin'
""I want every penny, I want every dime"" (Yeah)
""Once you finish with the cash
Open up the bag, throw some cigarettes inside"" (Yeah)
""Which ones do you want? Which ones do you want?""
""I'm not picky, give me any kind
Give me all of 'em, yeah, just toss 'em in
Keep it movin' though, I'm runnin' low on time and
I'd advise ya to move a little quicker
Trust me, I don't wanna have to pull the trigger
I've done it before, it's not a pretty picture
What, you don't believe me? I'm just playin' with ya
Well, no I'm not, no I'm not
Just do what I say 'cause if you even think of tryna pull a fast one on me
Promise you'll be sorry
Oh, my driver's calling, I can't miss my pick-up""
That's when I did somethin' stupid
And my jacket knocked over a can of soup and then
It got quiet, did he hear me movin'? Shh!
Hold my breath, he must've heard me do it, huh?
I'm assumin' the
Noise must've made him turn his head enough
To let the guy that was at gunpoint grab his own gun
Now they both got weapons
Maybe I should help him
Sneak up slow and deck him
Time to go, time to go, time to go
It's gon' be a bloody miracle
Now or never, God, if I had any blessings
Comin' in my future, could You send 'em to my present?
Peek around the edge, and I start runnin' at him
He don't see me comin', does he? Steppin' closer
Grab his neck and hold him, squeezin' on his throat
I'm tryna choke him, then his elbow hits my nose and
Think he broke it, I think he broke it, my
Blood is leakin' all over my clothes, I tried
Not to let go, but my hands begin to slip and bullets start to fly
Can't see out my eyes
Cashier still alive?
I can't tell, I'm tryna crawl away, here comes another guy
He runs inside, like, ""Where's the money?
Did you get the money? Where's the bag you brought?"" (Ayy)
""I don't know, I think it's still behind the counter
Prolly by the cashier I just shot"" (Ayy)
""Who's this on the floor? Who's this on the floor?
""I don't know!"" ""Well, did they call the cops?""
He runs up to me, then he grabs my shoulder
As he flips me over, then my jaw drops, 'cause
I thought his voice sounded real familiar, he's
Got a mask on, but the shirt he's wearing
Is the same one he had on this morning
Staring in my eyes, I know he knows I know
Embarrassed, he stands above me and says, ""Sorry Erin, but
I don't have a choice,"" he holds the barrel up
To my head, I scream, ""You can't be serious!""
He shakes his head and says, ""I'm sorry,"" then the gun—
[Interlude]
Get down, get on the ground

[Outro]
Cashier yells to ask if I'm okay, he's dialing 911
I run over to him, grab his phone and try to help him up
""911, what's your emergency?""
""There's been a robbery, the cashier was shot, he needs an ambulance
He looks kinda pale, I think he might've lost a lot of blood""
""Okay, help is on the way, has anybody else been injured?""
""Yeah, the robbers, there were two of 'em""
""Can you tell me their condition? Are they still alive?""
""Well, I'm not really sure, but they don't look so good
I'm pretty sure they're dead
Yeah, I think they're dead""
""Alright, take a deep breath
Everything's gonna be okay, you're gonna be alright""41Embed"

You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake
If you'd open your eyes then maybe you'd see what's at stake
You're sleeping, you're sleeping

[Verse 1]
You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
You got nothing
So what you do then is you start going backwards
You runnin' in a direction
And you lookin' for something that isn't real
And all you know is that you just gotta have it
What you're doin' is sleepin'
And thinking that you're awake and you're not
And the problem is that you don't know what you're after
So you put everything that you have into what you do
Hoping that one day maybe you don't have to feel like you're empty
But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
Then you look back and you start to regret things
You only get one life
And every time you lookin' at yours
You feel like everything you have is a waste!
And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
Is because you were never awake
[Pre-Chorus]
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

[Verse 2]
You wake up in the morning
But you feel like you never got up and go to work
And you feelin' like you ain't got a purpose
And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
Like you ain't nothing but worthless
And, yo, you look around
A lot of these other people you lookin' at
To you, you describe as perfect
So you point a finger at God and tell Him to do His job
And fix ya life up 'cause nothin' is workin'!
And you will try to hide it and make it seem like it's nothin'
But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you
And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you!
You only get one life
But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
Is because you were never awake!
Wake up
[Pre-Chorus]
You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape
'Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake

[Chorus]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

Call me at 3 a.m
Tellin' me that I could be the one, oh, yeah
Maybe I was in love from the outside
Guess I ain't what you want no more
If you got someone else inside of your life
Yeah, that's good for you, I'm happy
You got someone that makes you smile
More than I ever did, yeah, that's great

[Verse 1]
Listen, why they always tryna hurt me?
Why they always tryna burn me?
I swear to God, shoulda never even happened in the first place
Only time you hit me's on my birthday
Wish that I could tell you that I got a lot of love for you
Wish that I could tell you I got trust for you
Once you put some money in the bank you understand that the money ain't enough for you
Yeah, look what it's done to you
Everyone's your friend when the music start buzzin'
I'm closer to the people that were there when I was nothin'
Tryna talk about the past but you always changin' subject
I ain't good at shakin' hands but I'm good at holdin' grudges
Why you always frontin', huh? Always tryna play wit' me, woo!
Yeah, whatchu gotta say to me?
I am not a slave to the people writin' checks to me
This is destiny, they ain't never had respect for me, ah!

Call me at 3 a.m
Tellin' me that I could be the one, oh, yeah

I don't like that!
I don't like that, no! (I'm really sorry)
I don't like that!
Why you actin' shady on me?
Why you always tryna-
Why you always tryna play, I ain't got a clue right now
Everything I ever wanted was someone, I'm watching them go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you said I'm scared for you
Lemme say a prayer for you
Hope you never make it to the top just to find out there ain't nothing there for you
And now the people tryna tell you that they care for you, never cared for you
First time that you ever told me that you loved me, I know that was probably weird for you
'Cause I didn't say it back, I'm so caught up in the past, and I know I wasn't fair to you, woo!
Maybe I don't see the world like I'm s'posed to
Maybe I'm just living in a nightmare
Maybe all the people that I thought that I was close to
Wouldn't be around if it wasn't for my career
Yeah, this third record doesn't pop off, how many people 'bout to drop off?
I know how it works, if the record doesn't work, then it's my fault
I'm in a room full of fans singin' my thoughts, my God, woo!

Call me at 3 a.m
Tellin' me that I could be the one, oh, yeah
Maybe I was in love from the outside

(Yeah!) I'm back, did anyone miss me?
They said the second record can be tricky
Well, that's kind of funny, 'cause I am not trippin'
My fans—they know what it is and they with me
Yeah, I ain't the type that's gon' ride with the semi
I came from a town with three lights and no city
I've been doing shows for nothin' but pennies
When I leave the stage, they never forget me
Mansion was a glimpse of my life
I let you see what it's like to be in my head
People ask me what I think I think I'd be doin'
If it wasn't music, I'd rather be dead, agh!
You heard what I said, that was like me at a three
You don't wanna see me at ten
Or maybe you do
I promise if that is the case, then that is what y'all gonna get
If you're looking for music with watered down lyrics
I promise that you need to go somewhere else
And if you want somebody to tell you everything
That you wanna hear, I won't be any help
This flow is familiar, I think I heard it before
Yeah, I made it myself!
I left the door open to come in my mansion
But I never said it's a beautiful house
Some of y'all sat on the porch
Looked at my windows and stared at my door
They ask me if I'm gonna kill it this record
I laugh in their face and I ask 'em, ""Do you see the blood on the floors?""
""He's at it again""
""NF is crazy, he's bad for the kids""
""He never talks about nothing but him""
""And my friends say, 'He's kind of a diva.'""
Well, you need to get some new friends
I'm as chill as it gets
'Til I get on the stage and flip on the switch
And I go to a place where nobody is
If you bring up my name in a song, that's something that you will regret
Learned a lot in a year
I remember the shows when no one was there
I remember the shows when nobody cared
Some people in front of me laughing like, ""He isn't going nowhere.""
It's funny now, isn't it?
This type of life isn't how I envisioned it
This type of life, it just ain't how I pictured it
I'm in the back of the tour bus
Tryin' to FaceTime my family, it's different
Not what you think it is
Write a review, tell me what you think of this
Give me three stars and call me an idiot
But to be honest, it don't make a difference
I know some people don't get it
But you have now entered a therapy session
If you don't like music that's personal
I have no clue what you people are doin' here, might as well throw out the record
I pull up a chair, I talk to my music like nobody's there
Only person I judge is the one in the mirror
And lately, he ain't doin' well
I don't need y'all in my ear
I'm tired of hearin' it
You call it music, I call her my therapist
She keep on telling me I have been carryin'
Way too much baggage, I need to take care of it
I know she's right, but, man, it's embarrassing
Music has raised me more than my parent did
Take out a picture of us and I stare at it
Who am I kiddin'? You probably ain't hearin' this
Show me an artist you wanna compare me with
You put us both on a track, I'ma bury 'em
Give me the shovel, it's 'bout to get scarier
None of you want it with rap, who you staring at?
I see you got beats, but where is the lyrics at?
NF is the logo, you know I've been wearin' that
Don't come to my show and be sittin' that very back
I call you out in the crowd like, ""There he is!""
Thought I'd be happy, it feels like I'm cursed
It's hard to be clean when you play in the dirt
You gave me this place to go when I'm hurtin'
I thought it'd get better, but it's getting worse
And I got nobody to blame when I work
Like 24/7, I ain't been to church
And Satan keep callin' me, he tryna flirt
I hang up the phone, these are more than just words
I drive on that highway and listen to Mansion
I look up to God like, ""When did this happen?""
Yellin' with all of my fans to wake up
But feel like I haven't
I get emotional, I didn't plan this
I'm doing things I never imagined
I'm sorry, but I gotta leave
I don't wanna be late for my therapy session, agh!56Embed"

I'm not on your radar? Then your radar's broke
Don't blame me for the way y'all's jokes
Fall flat, get your mouth slapped—ain't no hoax
I get an inkling, they picked me for the weak link
I'm gonna have to pose
A question for the ones that don't accept that I been exceptional
'Cause the moment I get involved is the moment a song takes off
So how could you think I wouldn't last long in a game that
I was made to play? What do y'all take me for?
Rest assured
When I do come back to tour, it'll be Christmas mor-
​n​ing in a way 'cause I'ma wake up with a present so big, they'll jump for joy
Yeah, let it be known
I'm better when I'm outta control
I cannot be the butt of a joke
I'm cutting in the front of you po-
Sers talkin' like you really a pro
When you ain't even part of the convo
Nothin' but an amateur, I'll slow down when I want it colossal
Only way to put it if I chose
I could be bigger, maybe consider it, a bit of it was helpin' you all
To comprehend, you condescend (You're gone)
Incompetent, the consequences (Are)
Hard to miss, it's common sense (I'm on)
One, so wrap your head around it (Or)
I might have to get up off the porch
Show you how it's done, I got the form
Power trippin' on me, get destroyed
Pull the plug, I'm rollin' up your cord
[Chorus]
Fool me once—shame on you
Fool me twice—shame on you
Fool me three times, hold up, rewind
That's not even possible
Me, I keep it honorable
Who's your favorite? Let me know
Tally up, count the votes
Wasn't me? That's a joke
Yeah, ayy, that's a joke
That's a, that's a joke
Funny, yeah, that's a joke
That's a, that's a joke
Funny, woo, that's a joke
That's a, that's a joke
Funny, ayy, that's a joke
That's a joke (Haha)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, took a minute, now I'm at the better end of all of it
The day I wanna quit'll be a bitter one to swallow 'cause
I meant it when I said I wasn't really into audibles
I guess you gotta call 'em when your odds are at the bottom and
They're stackin' up against you, it's a pity, but they gotta give a nod to me
I'm runnin' with the best, I been the kind to make a profit
Off of everything that you told me wasn't possible
So why would you continue with the narrative
And not admit I'm somewhat incredible, look of a general
Hit 'em with the end of shovel, they wanna forget it
I put 'em on the ground and I get up and open the pit of my stomach
To remind 'em again, I'm a whole different animal
Whatever the case, I'ma get it, I'm in it, no doubt, I would give it
Everything if I gotta, but not if the commas
Are pushin' me to run with the common, the jokin' aside
If you took away the dummies and bias, you'll notice that I'm insane (Insane)
Improved a lot, but I still feel
It's hard to keep my lid from poppin' off, but I prevail
How you gonna skip over the details
And tell me to be focused? Hold that thought
Don't tell me you mean well if you don't mean well
I call the shots, but don't need my hand held
When it comes to makin' records
Who you know that does that better?
The way I connect letters
You'd think that the alphabet was made by me
When it comes to storytellin', I'm great at it
Tune in or get tuned out, my face got redder
'Cause I'm embarrassed for the ones unaware of my work
What, did I stutter?
Known to be cordial
But those that think that never seen me in a war zone
My delivery gets better every time I spit, I don't keep my sword low
Tell me why would I do that? Doesn't make sense when you're in a game this cutthroat
If you wanna maintain control
Then you gotta keep up if you can't handle the workload
Somebody else will
How could you call me unskilled?
That's like lookin' at Mount Everest and then calling it a small hill
Not at all thrilled, I'm in awe still
Tryin' not to laugh, but it just spills
Out sometimes, I been writin' chill
Just chew on this 'til the record's built, okay!
[Chorus]
Fool me once—shame on you
Fool me twice—shame on you (On you)
Fool me three times, hold up, rewind
That's not even possible
Me, I keep it honorable (Okay)
Who's your favorite? Let me know (Lemme know)
Tally up, count the votes
Wasn't me? That's a joke
Yeah, ayy, that's a joke (Joke)
That's a, that's a joke (Joke)
Funny, yeah, that's a joke (Joke)
That's a, that's a joke (Joke)

No question, tryna be the best that
Ever walked this earth, if I'm not, then I'm next up
Dressed up like I'm 'bout to hit a bank or somethin'
Yeah, I am not the one you wanna mess with, no!

You could run if you want, but you'll never catch me
So cold with it, y'all don't get it
Let you put me in a cage just so I can open it
Handcuffed, hands up, this is dope to me
Oh, you thought you had me captured? So funny
Better run from me, I don't think you really understand what this does for me
I dress bummy, but I clean up nice, they ain't never seen this side of me
Long T-shirt, they eyein' me
Rules don't apply to me
You better give me my privacy
I got the fans I got because I'm takin' them behind the scenes
You played hide-and-seek, I played hide-from-me, agh!

Why would I sit in a room full of people that don't even care about me or my future and tell me they ain't really feelin' the vision, then hop on the wagon the moment it's movin', huh?

Zoned out, come to my show with they phones out

Everybody wants they dream to fall in they lap, but don't wanna work for it

Pay homage, make comments
We in the same genre, but I can guarantee we don't put out the same product
Get away from me, there ain't nothing you can say to me
Tried to roll my name through the dirt, that's fine, I was made from it
You ain't made it 'til they printin' shirts with your face on it
Outside tryna sell 'em at your shows, those are fake, dummy
This is something can't nobody ever take from me
No mistakin' me, take a blade to me, take a vein from me
Let me know what you get when you pull the DNA from me, woo!
No matches, I've been the baddest, no way to match it
You never seen the passion that's even half this

I think the fact that you think I'm average is kinda madness
So quit your naggin', you couldn't fathom what I've imagined

Yeah, I feel like we might be on the come-up (all day!)

[Intro]
Yeah (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
I got layers to me
I got plans, I got goals, I got tricks up my sleeve
I got calls, I got deals, I got people to meet
I got drive, I got soul, I got everything (Ayy)
I got scars, I got heart, I got family to feed (Woah)
I got people mad, I ain't who they want me to be (Ayy)
I got people I don't know tellin' me what I need (Ayy)
Yeah, I got loved ones sayin' that they prayin' for me
I'm thankful for the prayers, I need more of those
Put my hands together, bow my head and thank the Lord for (Ayy)
Everythin' He's done, yeah, ain't none of us immortal
So while I'm still alive, I got so much to look forward to
Addicted to the craft (Woah), got no time to chat (Woah)
This a lil' somethin' to hold 'em over for what's next (Woah)
Even when I guess (Woah), I get it correct (Woah)
Question my work ethic, that's a question you don't ask (No, no, no, ayy)
Yeah, don't ever question if I hustle, work a double
Drop a bomb on me, I climb right out the rubble, not a struggle
Tossin' me under the bus'll get you muzzled
Pop your bubble (Pop)
Throw your compliments right out the window (Ayy)
So unique with this
I can flip the script and change the schedule, you'd still think that it
Happened how it should've, keep it subtle, bunch of geniuses
Put their heads together, try to huddle up, but still they sit
Confused about how I learned to juggle (Ayy)
Toss around some concepts 'til I pick one
Usually, I don't alter my traditions
Foreign to me, hit 'em with the switch up
I just had to get this out my system
Been a handful, even with a mouth full of hand soap
I still say what I want to
Getting past? No
Better chance beatin' Usain Bolt in my sandals
To be candid, that's like puttin' minivans in NASCAR
With a grandma in the driver seat with her hands up
Show goes on even after the show's over
To get past me, you would have to kill me (Kill me, kill me, kill me)
[Part II]

[Verse 2]
Ayy (Ayy- Kill me, kill me, kill me)
Tossin' what you want aside for longevity, ain't meant to be
If it causes everything to collapse and affects your heart heavily
What's worth it and what's not?
What's certain and which side would the coin flip to and land on?
When you guess wrong, do you stand up or stand down?
Even with a man down, I man up
Well-rounded, held out for the right outlet
Nine houses couldn't make me feel home, childish
Me left, see, the outcome every ounce of my childhood
Played a role in how I wound up with an outlook so crowded
No knowledge, couldn't see through the piles of my problems
Still piled up, past tense, man, I wish it was, but I've come
So far so quickly
In it for the long haul, it's routine
Only thing I'm cool with losing is losing sleep
And it's only cool with me
If it means I get to watch my dreams
Come true, if I kept it brief
Still you think it was a long story
Recording half of the things I think would
Take six years, prepare, 'cause the chance that you asked for
Might show up at your door one night like, ""I'm here
Gonna let me in or just stare?""
It's clear, yeah, six ain't enough
That wouldn't come close to the content between my ears
My layers have got layers
My layers have got layers50Embed"

Yeah, I got no excuses

Ayy, yeah, they asked me where I learned to do this

Treat my temper like my family, I ain't tryna lose it
Say a little, do a lot, woo, no excuses
Ayy, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no excuses
Woo, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yo, this industry is so confusin'
Hard to tell who's really with me or who's tryna use me
If I told you I respect you, I ain't say it loosely
I don't throw those words around, it's just not how I do things, ayy
Yeah, I know I can be a nuisance
Ain't afraid to admit it if I think the shoe fits
People ask me where I've been, I've been writin' new hits
Had to make my own plans, I don't need your two cents, ayy
Yeah, I don't wanna hear excuses
I just like to make moves and make improvements
I just like to break rules, maybe start some new trends
Live the life that I choose, cuttin' off the loose ends, ah

[Chorus]
Yeah, they asked me where I learned to do this

Woo, I got no excuses, yeah, I got no...
[Verse 2]
Yeah, here's a couple things that I'm confused with
I just did a interview, the guy was pretty clueless
You don't have to know the album names or all my music
But at least try to find out who you in the room with
Ayy, I like facts, I don't like assumin'
Take a shot behind my back, I'ma catch the bullets
Why the game lookin' at me like I'm just a tourist?
They should know I'm here to stay, this verse is gettin' borin'
Twisted mind of a lyricist, listen while I experiment
Visualize, it's imperative, big surprises and scary tricks
It is time, yes, we're here again, sit in silence, don't care for it
Criticizin' my character isn't wise, so beware of it
Forget what you're tellin' me, do what I gotta, man
I got the remedy, one of kind, but they never selected me
I don't fit in with the room of celebrities
I wanna know when they bring up my legacy
There was  nobody that ever could mention me
Sayin' that I wasn't makin' the rap
And doin' it cleverly, did what I had to
And gave it my everything

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, they asked me where I learned to do this
Self-taught, checkin' things off my to-do list
Treat my temper like my family, I ain't tryna lose it
Say a little, do a lot, woo, no excuses
Yeah, yo, they asked me where I learned to do this
Self-taught, checkin' things off my to-do list
Treat my temper like my family, I ain't tryna lose it

Let me work, show me where the mic is
I'm on stage, black shirt, in my Timbs
You know how I do it, I ain't playin' with you, I've been grindin' Anybody tryna sleep on me better do somethin' with your eyelids
I hear a lot of whinin', but I don’t hear a lot of rhymin', woo!
Everybody got opinions, let it go into my ear and then I block that
Put me on stage, I'ma rock that
Sayin' you the best? Stop that
Phony, I am not that, yeah
What are y'all doin' out here? What are y'all doin' out here?
Maybe you should spend a little less time with the women in your arms and a little bit more with your career
I ain't saying I'm the best, but I should be in the top ten; give me a list of names, I'ma top them
I'm just playing with ya, I don't care where the top is
Leave me at the bottom, let me work for it
You ain't never gonna find another rapper in the game and tell me that he works more
Tell me that he works more, nah!
You might see me with my hoodie up, I ain't leaving 'til I finish
This industry ain't nothing but a box, but I ain't gon' climb in it
You put me inside a room full of rappers, come back in five minutes
I'ma be the only one still alive, with a note on my chest saying that I did it!
You do it for fame, we are way different
Y'all are looking weak, we ain't cooking in the same kitchen
Everybody got a shirt with a stain in it
Some of us'll never wear it out though, lemme get it!
I guess I don't understand
This wasn't part of my plan
Some of these people, they're thinking 'cause they heard the name that they really know who I am
Bring the beat down!
I got no time for these Hollywood people, I'd rather give time to my fans
You'd rather chill with these women that like you for money
But I'd rather chill with my fam, yeah

They should be running from me
Most of my family, we don't even speak
I'm getting married in 22 weeks
And they still haven't said ""Hi"" or wanted to meet, huh?
I'm not the type to complain
If we don't get it, we try it again
And I'd die for the gang, Misfit my blood
They don't like us and we question they mom like
""Why did—why did you allow your kid to like bad music?""
Woo! Promise I do it (woo!)
I'm tryna give you my everything

[Verse 1]
I grew up in a small place, had to drive an hour just to see a movie
I'm a simple person, city life just doesn't move me
I'd rather be home with my grandparents and playing Euchre
Didn't wanna leave but this dream's calling, I had to do it
I left my girl there, wish I would've done it different
She was right when she told me that I don't ever listen
I told her I would change a million times and never did it
Apologies don't mean a thing if you don't ever fix it
I love what I do but it's not what I expected
This industry is not your friend, well that's my perspective
Sometimes the closest people to you make you feel protected
But those are the same people that hurt you most and leave you guessing
Some people say nobody's perfect but expect perfection
How you supposed to find the answer if you don't ask the question?
Sometimes I look into the mirror and talk to my reflection
When I go home and turn the music off, what am I left with?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
We used to be close but as time passed, we became disconnected
You never felt love and I always felt disrespected
Your family thought I was a joke, I was always defensive
They just wanted what was best for you, I just couldn't accept it
And hurting you was not a part of my plan or my intentions
But I was immature, I guess I had to learn some lessons
We grew apart and our lives went in different directions
And there's a lot of responsibilities that I neglected
I had a lot that was bottled inside, couldn't express it
And this pain won't leave, I can feel the depression
It's taking over my body, feels like I'm always stressing
Doctor told me I should sleep, but I'm always restless
I lay awake at night and think, my thoughts are relentless
I need a moment to breathe, I need a moment to vent this
I seem to be the only person that I play pretend with
And when I turn the music off, what am I really left with huh?

I'm the type to rent a hotel room just to be alone (Yeah)
I got an issue with people pretending they like what they don't
Please don't bring up my issues unless you gon' deal with your own
Please don't try to pretend like you keep it real, though
Yeah, it's funny that you got a lotta money
But that money doesn't buy you skills, though
I don't care if I am on the billboards
On a killing spree, I'm about to kill more
Got a chain on you paid a mill' for
I mean what you people even live for?
I write raps, you steal yours, oh Lord (Haha)
We just getting warmed up
Yeah, I said I was coming, I warned ya
So close to the fans, I feel like they ride on my tour bus
You wanna know what I do in my downtime? They come to my fortress
I apologize for all the corpses
It's a mess right now, but I haven't had time to put the rappers in the coffins (Yeah)
We ain't talked in like six years, why you writing me now?
I just turned a 100k down, just to keep the brand looking right, now (That's real)
I ain't bragging about the money, I'm just saying I ain't controlled by the bank account
Or the bank amounts, I'm a business man
But don't touch my money, I don't play around, woo!

About to hit the West Coast, hype crowds
I just put a record out, what you think I'm gonna pipe down?
Nah, I've been looking for a beat, look what I found, woo!

Tried to tell me, yeah, I ain't had the right sound
Oh yeah? Well, tell me what you think now
Two records in the bag, I ain't done though
What's coming next year? Let me hear the drum roll
Don't flow, anybody wanna be the one
To make an issue out of nothing? I'ma hit you with my iPhone
I know, I'm a little out of hand now
I ain't looking for a handout
You ain't like what I was doing last year which is funny
'Cause you lookin' like a fan now, are you a fan now?
I kinda miss being broke, now let me go back to my old days
When I used to walk into high school and hand out my CD in hallways
I told all my teachers that I'd be a rapper, they smiled and looked at me, ""Okay
That's a pretty nice dream, but you better get a real job."" Mmm, no way
Yeah, I live what you dreamin'
I could do this while I'm sleepin'
I ain't the type that will bring up your name for nothing
But please, don't give me a reason
I'm on the edge now, I ain't playin' with you
Never really been a fan of takin' pictures
I'm just being honest, yeah, I'll take it with you
Shows sellin' out, better get your tickets, oh Lord!
I got a love for the fans
I can't express what it feels like
Sometimes I wonder if it's even real life
Sometimes I look at the past and think about how I got here in the first place
You know the glove is my birthplace
I don't wanna be rude, but I could get you on my worst days
Say nothing for me, do it all the time
Yeah they barely workin' while I'm workin' overtime
Last year they like, ""Who am I?""
Now this year they like, ""You the guy""

Faith is something I am not accustomed to
And trusting other people's something I don't really love to do
I've never been a fan of it, I act tougher
Really my shoulders they ain't built for this and I don't have nothing
It's like I'm standing in the rain and you offer me a raincoat
But I would rather stand there and get wet than take the handout
What's wrong with me? You said you've always got your hands out
And I cannot continue on my own, so take my hands now
I give you everything, God, not just a little bit
Take it from me, I am nothing but a hypocrite
I hate sin, but I built a house and I still live in it
Afraid to open up the door to You and let You into it
My soul is lost and what it needs is Your direction
I know, I've told You I do not need Your protection
But I lied to You, this thing is tiring

And I know the Bible says I should always trust in You
But, I don't never read that book enough
And when I have a question I don't take the time to look it up
Or pick it up
It collects dust on my nightstand
I'm just being honest
Please take this outta my hands
I have no control - I am just a person
But thank the Lord that I serve a God that's perfect
I do not deserve the opportunity You've given me
I never knew what freedom was until I learned what prison means
I am not ashamed, I don't care if they remember me
My life will always have a hole, if You are not the centerpiece
Take me out of bondage, take all of my pride
If I don't have a Savior, I don't have nothing inside
Take all of my lust, take all of my lies
There's no better feeling than when I look in the sky, in Your eyes
It's amazing

You and I, we've been through a lot together
And I look back and I just, uh, I appreciate all the times that...that we had together, you know?
I remember just goin' down in my room and, you know, dealin'... tryna deal with some things
And you've always been there for that
Always, just me and you

[Verse 1]
You and I been best friends, ever since I was a young kid
Everything we did, where has time went?
Got a lot of years comin' up ahead of us and ever since we met
I knew we'd get somewhere, but the fact is I ain't really, I ain't really know when
I don't really know how either, but I can feel the goosebumps, my skin writin'
I've been waitin' for the moment, you and I can make it happen
Lot of people thinkin' we ain't gonna make it rappin'
I ain't got a problem with 'em though, they don't even matter
We ain't lookin' for the people tryna say that we the baddest
No, I never liked that
Came a long way, never did it for the money
We ever make it big, I'ma give it to the family
Lookin' back now everything is lookin' funny
You and I in the room writin', up late when the mood strikes us
We don't care if they do like us
Writin' songs for the haters we ain't even got yet
Freestylin'? Somebody turn the mic up
Talkin' 'bout things we don't really understand
Talkin' 'bout things we don't really comprehend
Me and you tryna get it, we ain't quittin' 'til the end
Now I'm standin' on stage tryna give it to the fans, yah!
[Interlude]
We took that karaoke machine from my room and, uh, we put it up to the CD player and played the instrumentals
And, man, we've come a long way
A long way

[Verse 2]
I made a lot of mistakes, you've been there for the whole thing
Help me with the drama
Rappin' in the car outside daily
We don’t care if it’s the winter, we don’t care if it's the summer
I remember writin' raps with the curse words
I just wanna hear it, seems like everybody does it
Did it for awhile wasn't into all the cussin'
Tried to find who I was, bein' everything I wasn't, real life, yeah!
Got a lot of anger, you know where I'm at, put it all over the pages
And wrote it into raps, said that we could be amazin'
If I give us a chance now I'm lookin' round like yeah, look at where we at
Look at where we at now, we ain't made it yet
But they can hear us in the background comin'
Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it
I'ma put it in His hands and let God do the judgin', yeah
Remember me and you, always had you in the backpack
Took you into school writin' on you like it's nothin', a lot of people in the room
See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue, nah, they ain't got a clue
We at the beginnin'
Hopin' someday you and I can say we made it and we did it
You ain't nothin' but a notepad to me, who you kiddin'?
I'm just runnin' out of space, I'll be back in a minute
Turn the page, homie
[Interlude]
You know what’s crazy is
This just started as somethin' that was an escape for us, you know?
And now I look around and there’s a lot of people out there goin' through the same things, you know, we've been through
Now this music we write is actually makin' an impact, it’s crazy

(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)

This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

[Verse 1]
Check, check, ayy, listen!
Yo, love is like a drug that everybody uses
You wanna know the outcome—depends on how you use it
Love could be your best friend, love could be your enemy
Love could be the thing you wish you had, but you don't ever see
And love can be the reason why you're afraid to have it
Some say it like it means something, others it's a habit
And some would say it's tragic, and some would say it's beautiful
Some would say it's black and it's dark like a funeral
And some would die for it, some don't think it's even real
Some say they understand, but really don't know how it feels
Some say that it's alive, some say that it can kill
But most of us that been in it know that sometimes it will
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it, yet sometimes it might surround you
One minute it's savin' you, next it's tryin' to drown you
Some people want to show it, but were never taught how to
And some of us is searchin', feelin' like it never found you
[Chorus]
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

[Verse 2]
Yo, love is like a privilege, a lot of us abuse it
Do with it what we want and then start drama when we lose it
Pretend like it ain't nothing to us, pretend that it's useless
And we don't know why we do this, but yet we still pursue it
And love, it can consume you, turn you into something else
Bury the real you so deep that you can't even find yourself
Love, it can change you, love, it can tear you down
Be the best thing you ever had and kick you on the ground
Yo, you get on that high level, yet you scared to fall
'Cause you know if that person hurts you, you gon' lose it all
They told you they would be there for you, they don't even call
So that openness you used to have has now become a wall
And some say that it's patient, some say that it's kind
I don't think it's invisible, but I know that it's blind
To some it's only physical, or all up in their mind
See, it probably isn't there if you're strugglin' to find it

[Chorus]
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love
[Verse 3]
This love has got me down low, now I guess I'm up high
One minute I'm on the ground, next minute I'm in the sky
I feel invincible, and so unrejected
Forget it, I'm invisible, and I feel unprotected
Yo, I don't need nobody else, trust me, I'm fine
I can't do this by myself, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, I can see clearly, forget it, I'm blind
My heart says, ""danger,"" can't you read the signs?
Yo, but through all the pain, I swear I love it
No matter what you do, it don't disappear, does it?
Yo, I'd rather spend a minute with love in my life
Than go a million years without knowing what it's like
You better grab it, you don't wanna lose it
And yeah, it brings pain, it's insane, but the bruises
My God can take that all away, you'll find that right person
And everything you thought that wasn't becomes worth it

[Chorus]
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy

Baby, I guess I don't understand
How did we let this slip through our hands?
We were so in love, and then we lost it all
And now it's over, now it's over
I know we said that we could just be friends
But I can no longer play pretend
Because the memories of us cloud my head
And I'm sorry, so sorry

And baby, I guess I can't comprehend
The fact that this could really be the end
I wish we could talk this out instead
But we've tried that
Haven't we tried that?
I'm doing my best to let this go
'Cause it's obvious that we're on different roads
You consume my mind when I'm alone
And I miss you
Oh, how I miss you

I'm boss with it, authentic, all y'all frauds better
Quit with the trash talk before you get tossed in it
Y'all tripping, bar ripping, y'all sipping too much, write 'till the palms dripping
Lost in it, thoughts different, you don't want no drama? Then don't get involved in it
I'm in a whole different head space, you making money? Well that's great
I got no interest in talking to people that I know are two-faced, too fake, get outta my face, woo!
What are you doing in my lane? There's already too many rappers
I'm sick of the traffic and I ain't got no brakes
I already passed you, you don’t like what I’m doing, who asked you?
You got into music 'cause you think it’s fun, man I’m doing this 'cause I have to
It’s real music, chills to it, feel through it, real stupid
Skills truest, quit moving, woo!
If I say something, I will do it, yeah
I used to dream of these moments
I'm living 'em now
Look up to heaven like, ""Mom, are you proud?""
I'm on the way to New Zealand, I'm up in the clouds, dang
I mean who woulda known this, who woulda known this
This industry never told me I was welcome
I went to the house with a bat and I broke in
Then told 'em that I would be back
I flatline, all of your whack rhymes, that's mine
Might get away from it, boy, MM LP—I'm the bad guy, last time
I have been taking it easy, the game's mine, fame why?
I don't care about none of that, I'm just sick of the trash lines
I grew up on Eminem, now look where the game's at
Lame raps, Hollywood fame acts, I'm sick of the same trash
I got no blunt in my mouth but give me a beat, I'ma blaze that, woo!
Give me a beat, I'ma blaze that, you and me ain't in the same class
You and me ain't on the same row, music has always been my home
I used to call up some people that won't call me back, now they blowing up my phone, woo!
Ain't it funny how that works? Mad perks, killing the record
Got blood on my black shirt, I'm jealous in love with the music, don't ever come near her!
I ain't from around here, how you let me run it down here?
If that isn't bothering none of you rappers then what are y'all doing out here?
That was like music to my ears, might never make it, I don't care
Drake, I love what you doing, but call up the game and tell 'em that I'm here, yeah!
I like that, might snap, I laugh, y'all better surrender and get out your white flags
And cancel your flight plans, your career isn't taking off
You sound like a hype man hit you with the mic stand
And they ask what the hype's about, come and find out, I mean, where are you clowns at?
I been training, pen game is insane, I'm done playing
This music is ground breaking, lung shaking, done waiting
Y'all taking my patience, quit faking, y'all hating, it's crazy!

Feels like I work my hardest when I'm at my lowest
Even unhappy people can have happy moments
Even small circles fall when the people you chose are
Lookin' at you like you owe 'em that money you're grossin'
Brief seconds that impacted my life on a huge scale
Weigh 'em like what's wrong and what's right
Predictions I predicted often arrive
Like they own the place and suffocate thе areas that I thrive
Had some disagreemеnts
Business model got some cracks, that's your biggest weakness
Way before I got involved, you knew that ship was sinkin'
So tellin' me to dive in water you won't dip your feet in
Tends to make me question you for lots of reasons
Keep twistin' my words, you got some courage, I applaud you
Tables, they turned, but was it worth what it cost you?
Watch and observe, lotta concerns in my heart, still
Angry and hurt, got what you earned bein' prideful

Takin' what you need, then blame it on me, man, that's so

Guess that's what I get for bein' faithful

Yeah, oh, you think I'm heartless 'cause I made dough?
Yeah, that's so painful
Didn't know what you was doin' on the down-low
Yeah, still you out here actin' like it's my fault
Yeah, I ain't never said I was an angel, I know
I know myself enough to know what I need
Showed you true colors, I don't like what I see
Story keeps changin', I know what that means
Know what that means, I know what that means
How'd you go from bein' that somebody I believed
Into bein' someone doubtin' me behind the scenes?
Can't forgive a sorry that I ain't ever received
I mean least you could've done was gave me an apology, but you're so

We gotta talk about things
We gotta do something different
'Cause this isn't working, this isn't working
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
Riding 'round the city, baby
I know you wish you could change me
Why you mad? Girl, why you angry?
Yeah, why you angry?
Back and forth, you love you hate me
Arguing about the same things
I don't, I don't know if I can do this
I don't, I don't know anymore, baby I don't know anymore

I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I mean she wants somebody that's working a 9-to-5
I apologize, but those ain't my hours, yeah you never been with a man
Who's working this kinda job, who works with this kind of drive, I wouldn't be with me either
Hold up, yeah I think that's work on the other line, I gotta go, we can argue some another time
Hang up the phone, I regret it right after
This is the chance that I just  couldn't pass up
See I signed a deal, you said I should've asked ya
I guess I was scared to see how you reacted
Or maybe I knew I'd be selfish
These are the things I ain't proud of
I's always the type to get jealous, there's always two sides of the story
And you're not the one that I blame when I tell it, that's real, yeah
You ain't the one, you ain't the one
I mean I should've manned up and that's hard to say as a man
The older I get the more I understand a relationship's more than just holding her hand
I'm sorry, you can blame me, yeah, you can blame me
[Chorus]
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean
I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things
That you don't mean, that you don't mean

[Verse 3]
What's going on?
I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel something
There's too many things I'm tryna deal with
And I understand that you don't feel this
I said there's too many things I'm tryna deal with (No)
And I understand I'm hurting your feelings
I know you don't feel this, yeah (Baby)
I'm just expressing the way that I'm feeling
The things that I'm trying to deal with
I guess I've been trying to hold it all inside
But it's obvious that that ain't working
Yeah it's obvious that that ain't working
The only thing we got in common
Is that we got nothing in common (Woo!), baby9Embed"

I've been-I've been doin' this a long time. I mean, over half my life. So, it's-it's awesome for me to be able to put out music that people will actually hear, especially when you put this much time into somethin' that you love, somethin' that you have a passion for. That's just, that's motivation

[Chorus]
I, I'm motivated, motivated
Motivated, motivated

[Verse 1]
When I first started, never knew if they will listen (Ah)
But when I write, I produce passion, that's Mel Gibson (Hey)
If music is a disease, I promise I'm infected (Ah)
I dream on different levels of dreams—Inception (No)
And these beats are my playground, let the words play (Ah)
You ain't catch it? That's wordplay, now you're stuck on the word ""play""
I'm all business, no suit on, but that's okay (Ah)
I will K.O. you (K.O.), if you come in my work space (Here yet?)
And don't you ever try to tell me I lack passion (Ah)
I'm a stand up guy, I promise you ain't laughin'
These rappers are slowin' the game down—bad traffic (Ah)
And how you gon' put me in a category of wack rapper?
Yeah, listen, I'm Hulk, I transform and I smash rappers
You sippin' on syrup, that doesn't mean you're a sick rapper
See, what it means is you gon' prolly get sick after
You don't like that I'm blunt or is it the fact that I smoke past ya?

Take your best shot (Shot, shot)
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)

[Verse 2]
I put work in this music, you think I'm makin' this up? (Nope)
If the songs ain't sharp, trust me they ain't makin' the cut (Get it)
You don't like it? I'm no teacher, but you'll learn to adjust
I'm my own worst critic, so, critics, step your hate game up
I'm a different breed of artist, I know how to survive (Ah)
You come into my lane, you better know how to drive
And I suggest you buckle up if you gon' come on this ride
No Johnny Cash, but some of y'all are walkin' the line
But you wrong though (Wrong though), y'all look curious (Ah)
Heath Ledger type of questions like, ""Why so serious?""
And you want watered down lyrics? Well, I don't carry 'em (Ah)
I dig holes for these tracks, and then I slaughter and bury 'em
The motivation I got is on a whole different level
I treat these lines like court case, I don't wanna settle
And my lyrics are bullets, and they're aimin' at you
And I ain't talkin' Switchfoot when I dare you to move
[Pre-Chorus]
Take your best shot (Shot, shot)

Yo, when it comes to punches, you know I'ma land mine (Land mine) (Ah)
No, I said I'm a land mine
Don't step on me or you'll get blown sky high
And I don't mean secrets when I say to keep it in mind
That I'm ill with the words—too sick
They say I rap hungry (Ah), well, that's 'cause I'm starvin'—Diesel
That's why they callin' me Riddick-ulous (Ah)
'Cause the look in my eyes is different, woo (Ha ha ha)

Overheats in the day, so I drive at night

Yeah, I know it sounds funny but it’s real life
I pulled over 'cause It died at a red light
I thank God for the hard times
'Cause I guarantee without him I wouldn't be here
Let's be clear
I was given two cars, I ain't really outta money
Tryna rap, makin' $9,000 a year
I don't say it so you feel for me
I say it 'cause it's real to me
I go to my grandma's, hoping she can make a meal for me
Now I got some labels on the tables
Saying that they got a deal for me, ah!

In Michigan, them winters cold
We wouldn't wanna turn on the heat, keep the bills low
We sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Yeah, we sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Me and my room-mate, we like ""they don't know!""
Driving around town in the Grand Prix
People telling me that I should get a Plan B
Snow on the windshield, can't see
Tryna work 6:00 in the morning, that's me!
Sometimes I miss all those memories
They pop up back in my mind like, ""remember me""
Records stop selling, these people won't care for me
The older you get, the more family is everything!

I just don't know what I'm chasing, don't know what I'm chasing
Yes, somebody told me
Life is something you don't wanna play with
But I just keep on playing like life is just a playground
I go through these mood swings
Watch everything slide down
I look at myself and I ask what the goal is (Goal is)
Yeah tell me what your goal is
I'm just so lost in emotions, I don't even notice
I just slip into a place and I don't think straight
Devil in my ear tryna tell me everything's great

Sin is bittersweet I taste it, bittersweet I taste it
Get that sickness out my mouth

Words until they actions strive on empty satisfactions
Yeah the fact is I don't know (Know), fact is I don't know (Know)
Yeah I get on these stages say that I put on a show
But yeah that show it don't mean nothing
If I don't live my lyrics, if they don't feel the spirit in my songs

Hard to see the real her when she got that fake mask
Daddy left it, he ain't never came back
Tears her apart but, she would never say that
She wants love, but don't know where to get it from
It's hard to learn respect from a man that never gave her none
So she cries and she yelling in the mirror
""Is anybody out there? Does anybody care?""
And people think they know her, but they don't really have a clue
Working three jobs, yeah she's doing what she have to do
Getting stressed out, and boys say she's beautiful
But that don't really mean a thing if she don't believe it though
Insecurity starting to take over
She looking for warmness but keeps getting colder
Yeah, I know ya tripping on your looks and such
But quit looking to world, and start looking up
God made you beautiful

Have you ever been so broke, or frozen, it's so cold
Emotions are so blown, hoping you won't go
Back to that war zone, the place that you don't know
It's hard to go the right way when you're on the wrong road
Feel like you're so low, you're 'bout to explode
And you'd do anything to get back what you let go
Stuck in upset mode, 'cuz you can't seem to figure this out
Living without a reason to live, thinking about
What you should have done, things that you could have changed
And maybe if you had then things wouldn't be this way
And you wouldn't feel this pain, but that's too easy now isn't it
Wishing that you could go back and things would be different
Got a time machine up in your mind
Wishing you could push a button and your life would unwind
But that's not how it happens, you can hope and imagine
Instead of looking forwards, lot of us looking backwards

Have you ever been so lost, you feel like your hope's gone
And know you need to let go of some things but you hold on
Hoping and wishing that some things would be different
So you scream in your room, it feels like nobody's listening
You're mad so you scream louder, things that you're not proud of
Wishing you knew a way to escape but you don't know how the
Heck are you supposed to cope with something you can't let go
You get emotional, wonder if you'll ever know
Came to get lost in it, wishing back lost minutes
Your anger's involved in it, so you get engulfed in this
Pain that you come to hate, wishing you could escape
But you don't know where to run, it's written all on your face
Look at me losing control, I just don't know where to go
I'm getting lost in the mo-ment, look at me woah (Yeah)
I think it's time for me to escape
Time to relate, follow me as I put this pen to this page

Go to my own world where no one can find me

Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash

I'm so sick of feeling
Like I don't have a clue what I'm doing

Yeah
And I'm so sick of feeling
Like I don't have a clue where I'm going
Like I don't have a clue where I'm going
Yeah

[Verse 3]
See all of us need a place, where we can go escape
Get away from the pain, be ourselves and just run away
But where are we running to, this lane we've been running through
Starting to get harder and it's starting to bother you
Some of us get depressed, some of us go to music
Some of us get stressed, others just push through it
So I'm gonna push through this, now and get lost in this
Escape and get lost in it, get ready we've all said it
[Chorus]
I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash

So I literally had everything that I had always dreamed of happening (Yeah)
And I felt... I didn't feel happy at all

Yo, to be honest, I feel completely alone
Like nobody knows me
Nobody understands me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, it's kinda like this
Check it out

[Verse 1: NF]
I'm a little bit numb, little bit frozen
A walking emotion, but nobody knows it
Nobody knows me
I'm lost and I'm caught in a cold dream
But they don’t see that I'm walkin' around so boldly
'Cause nobody out there knows these
Thoughts in my mind, am I wastin' my time?
I know, I won’t survive; hold me
'Cause I'm bleedin' to death
I got these holes in my chest
I feel like no one respects the fact that I'm up to my neck
I've done my best, but, still yet it seems like I'm out in the cold
Look at me froze; here on my own
Please, don’t let me die here alone

[Chorus: Tommee Profitt & Brooke Griffith]
I cannot face this alone
I can't get by on my own
[Verse 2: NF]
Lost in the moment
Life in a coma
Lyin' around, see my life getting colder
I'm alone, but I go nowhere
Living in a prison in my mind; so scared
I don't wanna be this way, nah
I don't wanna feel this way, nah
I don't wanna die this way
Why am I this way?
Wish I had wings so I'd fly away
Nothin' around me, up where the clouds be
I'm the real definition of drowning
My pain and my head keeps pounding
How's he even living in the state he's at?
Left the pain, swear I’d never go back
But it's right here, and it's quite clear that it's not leaving
Does anybody hear me?

[Chorus: Tommee Profitt & Brooke Griffith]
I cannot face this alone (I need You) (I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You) (I need You)
I cannot face this alone (I need You) (I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You) (I need You)

[Verse 3: NF]
I was a little bit numb, little bit frozen
Kinda hard to see when your eyes ain't open
How you gonna breathe when your sin keeps chokin'
You to the point that you feel hopeless?
Hopin' things will turn around
Kinda hard to fly when you layin' on the ground
Jesus is the only reason any of us breathin'
Yeah, so don't get down
You ain't gotta live your life in the cold
Thinkin' nobody out there knows
What you been through, where you been to
Yeah, you ain't gotta live alone
He's Messiah, He's Creator
There ain't no one out there greater
Forget about them haters, accept Christ and make a change-up
Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta die this way
Let Him wipe them tears right from your face
Life's a dream
So you better get back on track; in other the words, I'm saying:
Give Him your pain, give Him your hurt
Faith is way more than just going to church
Making your money and going to work
You don't give it to God? You'll watch everything burn, yeahh
And this ain't no game
Living without Him is just so insane
People, they livin' for money and fame
Things never change 'cause we living the same
I don't wanna be alone; hate the cold
I'm so broken, I'm so froze
But no longer
'Cause I got my Jesus, and He makes me stronger

Maybe you and me could take a trip to the sky
Feels like I'm already there when I look in your eyes
Ay, listen, baby, I was thinkin' maybe
We could take a trip and go around the world
Wouldn't really matter where we at as long as you're my girl
Some say I'm crazy, but that don't faze me
You remind me of the sunshine when it's rainin'
Even if it's for a minute, I forget where my pain is
And that's for real, that's the way I feel
Got me feelin' so good every time you laugh
I wonder how we got here, how did this happen
I don't care, and baby girl I swear

[Chorus]
Baby, you and me are like the stars in the sky
Sometimes we look dim, sometimes we look bright
And that's okay, yeah
And that's okay, yeah
And baby, you and me are like the rain in the clouds
Sometimes we stay up, sometimes we fall down
And that's alright, yeah
And that's alright, yeah

But baby, hold up, I just gotta notice
You look kinda mad, was it something that I said?
'Cause you know I didn't mean it
Yeah, you know I didn't mean it
You look kinda upset, was it something I did?
If I had the chance then I would take it all back
But I don't
But I don't
I don't wanna sound like I think I'm perfect
'Cause that's not me
Yeah, that's not me
I don't wanna act like I'm that kinda person
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see, yeah?

And that's alright, yeah

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna sound like I'm jokin', yo
'Cause the point I'm at is emotional
Look at me go, talkin' about the pain I feel and the way, I don't
Wanna see you walk out that door
Can imagine not seeing you no more
But I guess I'm just gonna have to get used to it and just learn to cope
I don't know which way we're supposed to go
Lookin' for the pieces of our hearts, it's obvious we're broke
I'm so sick of the overload that's holdin' on them roll and go
Maybe we should turn around if we forget we ever--No
That would defeat the purpose, now wouldn't it?
And this relationship isn't how I envisioned it
This ain't how I pictured it, but I don't care
'Cause even when you're gone, it's like you're still here
So, I don't wanna hear about how this ain't workin'
And this relationship don't have no purpose
And maybe tomorrow we ain't gon' be feelin' the same
That's okay, as long as you know how I'm feelin' today

Yeah, I don't know
I guess I feel like—when I'm around you—that I'm invisible
It's like you don't even see me
And I'm standing right in front of you, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I feel invisible, I knew this wasn't easy
I'm standing right in front of you, but you don't even see me
I pass you in the hallway, but you don't even glance, so
I just kinda walk by like I ain't never passed you
I do my best to pretend that I don't notice you
'Cause you don't ever notice me, so what am I supposed to do?
What, I gotta yell it in order for you to see it?
Got it written on my face, it's pretty easy to read it
But you choose not to, so that's what I'ma have to do
My heart is getting tired; I'm tired of running after you
I try to talk, but you just keep ignoring me
Pretending that you listen—you don't listen; you're destroying me
See, I look up to you, but you keep looking down on me
You never say you love me or you care or that you're proud of me
In other words, you're drowning me
I get on my knees and I pray
Pretty pathetic, but you make it pretty easy to say

[Chorus]
I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore
[Verse 2]
You like a nightmare, every time I'm dreaming
The longest conversation that we had was when we're screaming
""And what you say?"" ""What you say?"" There's nothing else to talk about
Before I even say a word, it's like you're already walking out
You keep making promises, but you don't ever keep 'em
And then look at me stupid when I say I don't believe 'em
Yeah, that's right I don't believe you, and how do you expect me to?
You don't show respect to me, but I should show respect to you?
Gosh, you're such a hypocrite, I doubt you're even listening
Things have got so bad, you don't even pretend you're interested
And every time we hug, which isn't very often
The thing I used to love has now become something that's awkward
You put that smile up on your face, but I can tell you're faking
You look me in the eyes and you tell me I'm amazing
But all your words are wasted, 'cause I swear that you make it up
And I'm so sick of chasing love; I guess my pace ain't quick enough
I hate it, 'cause

[Chorus]
I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore

[Verse 3]
I'm full grown now, moved out, I thought it was best
The sad thing is, I doubt you even noticed I left
I quit calling 'cause you ain't ever answer the phone
So the last time we talked, I told you, “Leave me alone”
I'm supposed to open my arms and hold you now?
Hold you? Wow. You ain't never held me; how—
Do you expect a kid that you never raised to do right—
To break the walls down and make you a part of my life?
But hold up, here comes a call from the hospital
They told me I should come and see you if it's possible
I got my shoes to go, I threw my pride on the floor
Saw a real smile on you when I walked in the door
The doc told me you ain't got more than a day
I just got you and this cancer gon' take you away
You say you love me, you can see me, everything's okay
For some reason, I no longer feel the urge to say
[Chorus]
I swear, I must be invisible
'Cause you never see me anymore
And I swear, I must look miserable
'Cause you never hold me anymore

Flying over clouds or somethin'
I don't smoke weed, but you could say I'm high on somethin'
Its like this music is my addiction, I call it my nicotine
What you're witnessing is an addicted fiend and it sickens me (AH)
Just a lame as how you picture me
Give me that microphone and I'm gonna rip it so viciously
Ain't you hearing the chemistry?
Ain't it ironic I brought up chemistry?
Cuz I was never good at math but I'm ill with the melodies

[Verse 2]
Since I was a kid, I had a dream that I would make it
I spent thousands of hours writing music in that basement
Even though I'm broke, you know why I still chase it?
Cuz once you get a taste of it there is no replacement
Yo, I don't rap, so millions of people will like me
I rap, cuz there's millions of people just like me
If you think I'm out of my mind, I ain't gonna argue, I might be
But I'm not on the stage just for people to sightsee

I'd rather die than let this dream go to waste

I'm just being me, yea

And this defines me
Look into my music and you'll find me

When I step into that studio, feels like I'm in my house
If you listen to my music than you know what I'm about
No I ain't never been the type to just sit around on the couch
I get lost in these beats till my body passes out
Let's rewind
What ever happened to music that meant something
Cuz nowadays I look around and music don't mean nothin'
And to be honest what's really making me sick to my stomach
Is everybody's runnin' around screaming they love it

[Verse 4]
A lotta people think they understand the music biz
I am not a genius but at least I know what music is
Put a CD on the shelf, and you thinkin' you'll be filthy rich
But you just become the definition of what filthy is
The music, me and her, we've been through a lot together
And I can tell somethin' ain't right if we are not together
And yo God gave me the story so we plot together
I get shot, whatever, this is who I am remember?

Which caused me to have make a call I thought was ballsy
Resulting in what you see today, proceed indulging
As always, the one-trick pony sing it, so quit your sulking

[Verse 2]
Born efficient, got ambition, sorta vicious, yep, that's me
Not artistic, unrealistic, chauvinistic, not those things
Go the distance, so prolific, post too cryptic, move swiftly
Unsubmissive, the king of mischief
The golden ticket, rare sight to see
I stay committed, embrace the rigid
I'm playful with it, yeah, basically
Too great to mimic, you hate, you bitter
No favoritism, that's fine with me
Creatе the riddles, portrayed uncivil
Unsafе a little, oh, yes, indeed
It's plain and simple, I'm far from brittle
Unbreakable, you following?
I'm Bruce Willis in a train wreck
I'm like trading in your car for a new jet
I'm like having a boss getting upset
'Cause you asked him for less on your paycheck
I'm like doing headstands with a broke neck

I'm like saying Bill Gates couldn't pay rent

Unbelievable, yes, yes, inconceivable
See myself as fairly reasonable
But at times I can be stubborn
So, if I have to I will rock the boat

That's just not the way I like to roll
What you think's probably unfeasible
I've done already a hundredfold, a hundredfold
It's probable, that I might press the envelope

Now they come around like, ""Homie""
Man, y'all better back up slowly, back up slowly, woo

Who are you kidding?
How could you doubt me? I've always delivered
Ripping the teeth out of the back of my mouth
The closest you get to my wisdom
See my initial thought was to wait, but what can I say? I had come to visit
Check on you guys, you doin' alright?
Your year really sucked? Yeah, that's what I figured
They cover they heads up whenever I drop
Shake the whole industry, put 'em in shock
Come out the clouds like a meteor rock
Then land on the earth like ""Ready or not?""
Ain't no one like me, the cream of the crop
Don't even front better, give me some props
I pick up your body and throw it a block
Okay, I admit it, that's over the top, not
Deer in the headlights looks every time I step my foot
On the ground I get mistook for a lame with no weight to his name
Ground just shook, let's not beat around the bush
Even my B-sides throw 'em off like how's he do it?
Some say I'm a great influence
I don't know about that, but I did do the best I could
[Bridge]
Hollywood, Hollywood, hope Nate doesn't go Hollywood
You think that y'all know me good
You think that y'all know me good
Hollywood, Hollywood, hope Nate doesn't go Hollywood
You think that y'all know me good
You think that y'all know me

[Outro]
I, I, I, I, I always advance
Say how I feel, you know where I stand
Raising the bar, I gotta expand
Top of the charts, I'm setting up camp
Pound in my stakes, I put up my tent
Shoot for the stars, they fall in my hand
Stick to my guns, I don't even flinch
Can push all you want, ain't movin' an inch
I rarely miss, you know I'm relentless
Ain't got a choice, no way to prevent it
Just who I am and I don't regret it
See what I want and then I go get it
Followed my gut, I'm happy I did it
Beat all the odds, I ain't got no limits
Cannot be stopped, you paying attention?
I ain't gotta say it, they know where my head is
They know where my head is (Head is)5Embed"

Oh, I miss you
Whoa, I miss you
Now you're gone, yeah
Now you're gone
Oh, I miss you, yeah
Oh, I miss you
Oh, now you're gone, yeah, yeah
Now you're gone, no

[Verse 1]
I should have been there, told you that I loved ya
Held a little tighter as I kiss, and when I hug ya
I should have called ya, told you that I missed ya
Tears on my face as I'm lookin' at your pictures
Yeah, I'm with ya, but only in this mindset
Since you've been gone you ain't never left my mind yet
And I'm upset, not because of you
I wish all I remember was the good, I never do
I guess when you lose somethin', that's when you appreciate it
If you were here, then I'd show you my appreciation
But you're not, so I'mma have to learn to cope with it
Got a box of memories, but I'm scared to open it
I see you smilin', but only when I'm dreamin'
I know you're gone forever, but somehow I don't believe it
Somebody wake me up, my eyes closin'
I'm hopin' some day you'll be there when they open, but
[Chorus]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (And now you're gone)
And now you're gone (And now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh, I miss you (Oh, I miss you)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wish you can hear me, I know you don't
And I wish you would call me, I know that you won't
But why I gotta cry? Sick o' dwellin' on the negative
Use what you love, it'll will take you where you never been
Yo, depression, naw, far from it
Have I cried? Oh, yeah, I've done it
If I could I'd change, and I'd go back
Problem is if we could, yeah, we'd all do that
I can see you laughin' in my memories
Sad part is that's the only thing I'll ever see
Used to wear a tough face and play pretend
Now the fact is I'm never going to see you again
See, my life just doesn't seem right without ya
I can feel the tears comin' when I think about ya
Matter fact, I think I feel some now
I'm sick of holdin' them back, that's why I'm lettin' them out
[Chorus]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (And now you're gone)
And now you're gone (And now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh, I miss you (Oh, I miss you)

[Verse 3]
I look in the mirror, I can see you in my face
I could care less now about your mistakes
Not 'cause they don't bother me, not 'cause they ain't bruise me
I just kinda feel like you ain't never knew me
I'm all mixed up, lost in the emotion
Loved you so much, too bad I never showed it
Yeah, but on the upside there's one thing
You put a smile on my face most times I sing, so
Mom, if you were here today, I would put my arms around you
And tell you I love you, yeah
I'd tell you I love you, I'd tell you I love you
Yeah, I would put your hand in mine, and tell you everything's okay
Oh, I miss you
Oh, I miss you, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (And now you're gone)
And now you're gone (And now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do

You say that you love me
Let's talk about it
And you swear that you'll always be there
I doubt it
When I look in those eyes
I can tell you're lying
All those tears that you cry
Why do you keep denying

[Chorus]
You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

[Verse 2]
We lay in my bed, so irritated
All the things that we said
Yeah, it's so frustrating
Who am I to tell you that you're not perfect
It's just that I thought that you were a different person
We smile and pretend like nothing matters
When in fact, in the end, it just makes us madder
[Chorus]
You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

[Verse 3]
I look at you now
Yeah what I used to see
Is breaking me down
Why ain't you like you used to be?
Still beautiful as ever, yet I feel no unity
Usually, I just feel like you're using me
You're telling me you love me, yeah, from the lips of your mouth
But honestly, honesty isn't what I think's coming out
Seems the people you love the most, push you down, let you go
That's why I'm here to let you know, we lie to people just for show
You pretend you care, but really it don't bother you
Wonder if it will when I decide to say goodbye to you
I'm trying to fix it, what you think I'm trying to do?
You don't like my attitude, then wonder why I'm mad at you
I've had enough of it
My heart, you ain't touching it
You say you're in love with it
But really, you're crushing it
I don't hate you, I'm just trying to understand how you feel
There ain't no point of continuing this if it ain't even real
[Chorus]
You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing

For the way I'm livin'
(I'm a sinner man, all of us are)
Lord forgive me
For the way I'm livin' (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive me, I know I've made a lot of mistakes
When you look at my face you can tell I'm ready to break
Ready to snap, lost, where am I at?
I keep looking for light but why am I in the black
It's invisible I've been mixing and twisting the principles
There I go talking 'bout my life, how it's miserable
It's pitiful I live in this prison I been in through
Tryin' to minister when I'm the one that needs to be ministered to
Lord forgive me
I don't know why I do this
I betray You stab You in the back like Judas
Like Peter I deny You, like I don't know
Tears running down my face as the rooster crows
I'm a liar living in a world of 'em
I'm dyin' sins starting to fill my lungs
Oh no, I can hear the devil of my head
Great, Nate it looks like you're doin' circles again
[Chorus]
It's like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell
It's like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell

[Verse 2]
I wake up in the mornin'
My minds on me
Never said a prayer, Lord, never even noticed
Why am I so open to blaming when I'm broke
The moment I feel fine, I let the door close
Dealing with insecurity but not about myself
I'm having a hard time trusting anyone else
I treat you like a toy
So I put you on the shelf
Like I'll come play later if I need any help
And yeah I think you're calling but I don't really hear you
Seems I should be concerned with what I see in the mirror
What I see in the mirror's more than my apearance
I see anger eating away at my spirit
And maybe I should change, but I don't really want to
Unless I feel pain it's like I don't really want you
I know, by now it seems like I'd be smarter
The worst part is, now I'm right back where I started
[Chorus]
It's like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell
Its like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell

[Verse 3]
Father please, I know I don't deserve your grace
None of us do, yet, your mercy remains
You were perfect, there I go running away with nothing to say
Lord, I'm ready to change
Take me, and mold me into something that's right
Sick of living my life
Like I'm out of your light, I'm out of your sight
I need you to charge in
Take me out the darkness
And wrap me in your arms cause
Without you I'm just another phony
And without you it's like I don't even know me, show me
Pull me in the right direction
Need your life protection
Need the mic directed
I'm sick of living life like I ain't gotta have you
When in the end we both know that I have to
It's sad too
'Cause every time I'm falling away
I can hear the little voice inside my head say
[Chorus]
It's my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell

Overpower you, and demolish you
Have you wrapped up, runnin' like a coward do
And yo, it's crazy, look around

But is he under me now?

He around us around in the world today

Why should I have to repent for things?
Why would a god that loves me so
Leave me in a world so broke, so cold?""
People askin' the wrong questions
Someone gave you the wrong message (come on)
Why would a god that's fake come down to this earth to get socked in the face? (socked in the face)

Why would I lie to you?

Imagine where your life could go in His hands
You don't understand, picture this:
Thorns in His head, nails in His wrist
Streched like this
Dying for us, yeah, extraordinary
In God, I trust

When you wake up and you wish you could just forget about everything
Throw the pain away for just one minute?
Look at the sunshine instead of the rain

I was driving down the road today
And saw the sun shine through my window
It made me smile
Yeah, I ain't done that in a while (that in a while)
Yeah, I saw a rainbow up in the sky
It made me wanna grow wings and spread them and fly
I could if I tried to
Listen, heck, the birds in the sky do (the birds in the sky do)
Sometimes I see the rain coming up in the clouds
I could care less, let the rain come down on my face
Wash the pain away (wash the pain away)
See, I don't like the feeling of losing control
But at least for one moment, Imma let things go and just be myself
Spread my wings and yell (wings and yell)

I'm gonna fly
I don't care what nobody says
And I don't care what nobody thinks

I was driving down the road today and saw the rain fall on my windshield
It made me sad
But then I laughed (then I laughed)
Cause everybody knows it's gotta rain
Sun wouldn't feel so good if it never felt pain
I like that sound
But when I look around (I look around)
I see people just like me
Sick of dealing with the pain, trying to follow their dreams
And I get lost in the moment
In case you haven't noticed (yeah)
Everybody wants love, but I don't know where to find it
So I wrote a song as a little of a reminder
Just be myself
And nobody else (nobody else)

And I don't care what nobody thinks

Yeah, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly, yeah)

This is my moment
So I'm gonna do my best to control it
I feel like I'm walking through a door that has never been opened
What's on the other side
I don't have a clue where I'm going
To be honest, I could care less if anyone knows it
I put on a smile
And both of my feet through the door
All of a sudden, I don't feel the pain anymore
For some reason, I feel like I'm apart from the ground
Like every pain that I'd ever felt is off of me now
Must be flying or something
What am I, up in a cloud?
Look at me, wow, well this is kinda freaking me out
Must be a dream
Either way, I don't wanna come down
Like the feeling of feeling like I've no longer been bound
Turn around for a second
I look back and the door shut
Maybe I should go back, but I don't know for what
Come on Nate, you must be losing your mind
Maybe so, but here I go
Follow me up to the skies (singing)

And I don't care what nobody thinks

I'm lookin' for that overflow, somethin' I can love
You think the show's over? Oh no, it's just begun (c'mon)
You can call me special feature, yeah it's nice to meet ya
But my name is not what I came to teach ya
Yo, I know a God who can save ya, won't leave ya
He don't show His face, well He don't really need to
I give Him the glory for everything I have
He's more than just a story or something of the past
I ain't afraid to talk about it, ain't afraid to act
See, I'm just being me, man, and I don't need a mask
You all about the fast life, livin' for the money
A lot of people act like rap, tight gunnin'
Runnin' from the cops, see, to me that's nothing
But according to you, yeah, that might mean somethin'
That's why I give it to you in a form you understand
Cause sometimes in life things never go as planned
And sometimes you might feel like there's no chance

If God's so real, why the world so crazy?
The rape rate climbin' and girl's havin' babies
Murders in the streets, murders in the schools
If God really cared He wouldn't let the pain pursue
But a lot o' y'all are lookin' from the wrong angle
And overdose in sin, and hey, your whole life tangles
You look in the Bible, even Satan was an angel
That just goes to show what lust for power will create you
Into something crazy, into something pitiful
You don't want the truth now, you'll get it at your funeral
Some think it's a joke, overdose, keep laughing
Ain't gon' be so funny when you layin' in your casket
God, He can save you; I ain't tryna play you
I'm just tryna represent the one and only Savior
Lies of the world will leave you like a broken heart
Hey, you lookin' for the same thing that tore you apart
[Chorus]
He could be your comfort when you're broken
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow
He could be your Savior, be your friend
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow

[Verse 3]
God could be your overdose, so let me explain it
Ye ain't got the picture yet, you got the wrong paint
Now I know I'm hittin' you with a lot of information
But what I'm tryna do is introduce you to a Savior (Jesus)
I worship a God that made the world in six days
I worship a God that will never turn away (turn away)
I worship for truth, yeah, I worship for faith
And even if you kill me, you couldn't take that away
I'm livin' for that overdose, someone get me high
I'mma represent Him with my flow until I die
Devil say you're hopeless, it's just all up in your mind
I'd rather die for truth than live forever for a lie

I took a chance
But how am I supposed to see
When I'm blinded
And when I'm broken
Lookin' for a way to escape
I can't find it
But then I'm reminded of Your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Of Your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I thought I was fine
I guess not
If I was I wouldn't feel this way
If I was okay
And I was so perfect
Then why do I feel so ashamed
I'm no liar in my head
Screaming I don't need any help
I say I'm tryin', yet in the end
I'm only tellin' lies to myself
I say I want answers
Complaining
Yeah, I'm just looking for truth
Unless I got problems
Which I got 'em
I seem I only blame 'em on You, whoa
It's like I don't know what to do, whoa, yeah
[Chorus]
And now I don't know who I am
This was never my plan
This ain't how it's supposed to be
I took it out of Your hands
I took a chance
But how am I supposed to see
When I'm blinded
And when I'm broken
Lookin' for a way to escape
I can't find it
But then I'm reminded of Your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah)
Of Your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Lord, forgive me
I feel so cold
Livin' in the wrong
Yeah, here I go
I don't want to cry
I don't want to show all the emotion
I got froze
I don't know how say this easy
Look in the mirror but I don't see me
I don't see the things I used to know
Swore to myself
Never let You go
Here I go
Pain again
Here I go
Playin' pretend
Actin' like I'm fine
When in my mind I'm just breakin'
Lookin' for a reason
Wonder why I'm breathin'
Wonder why my momma had to die
Lord Jesus
I don't understand this
I ain't never planned it
My plan did never evolve
We feelin' trashed in
I feel like I keep falling down
Lord, please help me up
I've had enough
[Chorus]
And now I don't know who I am
This was never my plan
This ain't how it's supposed to be
I took it out of Your hands
I took a chance
But how am I supposed to see
When I'm blinded
And when I'm broken
Lookin' for a way to escape
I can't find it
But then I'm reminded of Your grace

Of Your grace

[Verse 1]
When I was 12, I created a dream and told myself that rap was all that I need
You put a knife in my heart, I swear to God, music is all that I bleed

[Verse 2]
I don't hide behind beats, I am raw, listen
These beats hide behind me, y'all are all trippin'
I cut 'em open, I let 'em leak, I'm what you call vicious
A boss with it, I write a song with my arms missin'
That's off-of-the-top music, I am bar rippin'
Y'all lookin' for lukewarm rhymes, you're in the wrong kitchen
I'm known as a lot of things, but calm isn't one of them
I'm close to the music, never been long distance
The industry had the doors locked, but I barged in it
I don't belong here? Ah, who are y'all kiddin'?
You against me, you're all victims, all thinkin' the10Embed"

[Verse]
Yo, I ain't what you assume, so think twice
I guarantee that they don't have a clue what I think like
I might come across like a rebel, I see life
Out of the box, don't put into there, that I might
Start a revolution, break out of it, rewrite
The history that you made and take it to new heights
Every loss is a lesson, that's why I never lose fights
And I learn from my mistakes and I use 'em, that's my right
To tell you how I feel, whether you 'gon listen or not
You don't agree with it? Then you can listen and watch
You ain't in peace with it? How do you envision the plot?
I've taken everything I love and makin' it rock
You see, my mind doesn't work like your's does
When I fall down, I just stand up more tough
And I'm not afraid to die, I don't care if the war comes
To my front door, see I just open the door up
[Chorus]
I'm ready

They won't break me—I might fall, but that won't change me

And you might pull me and take your shots, but you won't move me

Record four
Let's go
Yeah, it's record number fo'!
'Errybody knows
Yeah!
I'ma let it, I'ma let it, I'ma let it go
I'ma let it go
Yeah
Listen!
Oh, no! Yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't the type to take a gat and put a hole in your head (nah!)
I'm the type that take the mic and clean your soul up instead (yeah!)
What I say and what I write is motivation, forget it
You want a Shady number two, man that's not what this is (not what!)
It's like we all take sin and adapt it
Used to seem ugly, now it's lookin' attractive (real pity)
Used to let it bug me, now we like it when it happens (crazy)
It's like when it happens (nah!), your life is inactive (yeah!)
World's satisfaction will play with your mind
Got you think you're gettin' 'head, but your fallin' behind
Yo, DMX said, ""Lord, send me a sign""
Read a little Revelation, and that's what you gon' find
See, in every line, I present you with facts
And yo, in every rhyme I desire to impact you (thank you)
Go inside of your mind
I rewind and go back to a place or a time
You traveled off of the map
Do the math, yeah
Money put a smile on your face
Same thing that make you smile will make your smile go away (yeah!)
See, the riches of the world might get you the chains and Nike's
But in the end, neither one of those'll save your life
[Chorus]
Until I die
I'ma take my hopes and dreams
And use 'em to glorify His Name
Until I die
I'ma rep the one true God
And I don't care 'bout what nobody say
Until I die
I'ma spread the truth to this nation
And show 'em there's a God that can save 'em
Until I die
And here I take my last breath out of my chest
I'm gon' praise Him

[Verse 2]
MTV knows how to get the alley-oop (yeah)
All they gotta do is mix a little lie with some truth
Come out here, girl! Let me fix that face up
Need a little less clothes and a lot more makeup (haha!)
Get all caked up
Oh no, here we go
Another episode, skippin' down the Hollywood road (haha!)
Where you goin'? Nobody knows, nobody cares
Then you wonder why the girls around the world insecure (yeah)
It's so stupid
You want the truth, kids?
The media's just one big lie of losin' (come on!)
It's like I'm watchin' a movie, world's so full of actors (actors!)
Take a moment listen to me, I'm not actin'
I'm just askin'
Tell me if you're ready to die (nah)
If it happened today, where would your soul reside?
Devil laugh 'cause he know how to play with your face
So I just laugh back and pick up the mic and I say

Until I die
I'ma take my hopes and dreams
And use 'em to glorify His Name
Until I die

And I don't care 'bout what nobody say

And show 'em there's a God that can save 'em
Until I die
And here I take my last breath out of my chest
I'm gon' praise Him

[Verse 3]
I'd rather die today for what I believe in (come on)
Than die a hundred years from now for no reason (well, why?)
Atheists are like, ""I don't know why I'm breathin'
Yeah, there's gotta be a reason, but there's no Jesus"" (haha)
Standin' up screamin', ""He's not real!"" (he's fake!)
Honestly, I'm sorry that's the way y'all feel (fake!)
World's kinda like, to me, just a roller coaster
You in it for the ride? Well, what's up when it's over? (yeah, yeah)
You keep doin' wrong when you know it ain't right (yeah)
How you live today, it turns eternal life (eternal life)
You let it slip away, and it's gon' blast you
Keep the sin up in your face, then the truth gon' pass you
My momma used to tell me I should follow my dreams (come on!)
But most of my life I just been followin' me (yeah!)
So I'ma take this moment to release my shine
And yo, forget about me
Let His will be done, man, not mine
[Chorus]
Until I die
I'ma take my hopes and dreams
And use 'em to glorify His Name
Until I die
I'ma rep the one true God
And I don't care 'bout what nobody say

Yo, to be honest, I feel completely alone
Like nobody knows me, nobody understands me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, it's kinda like this, check it out

[Verse 1: NF]
I'm a little bit numb, little bit frozen
A walking emotion, but nobody knows it
Nobody knows me
I'm lost and I'm caught in a cold dream
But they don't see that I'm walkin' around so boldly
'Cause nobody out there knows these
Thoughts in my mind, am I wastin' my time?
I know, I won't survive; hold me
'Cause I'm bleedin' to death
I got these holes in my chest
I feel like no one respects the fact that I'm up to my neck
I've done my best, but still, yet it seems like I'm out in the cold
Look at me froze; here on my own
Please, don't let me die here alone

[Chorus: Sean Simmonds]
I cannot face this alone
I can't get by on my own
[Verse 2: NF]
Lost in the moment, life in a coma
Lyin' around, see my life getting colder
I'm alone, but I go nowhere
Living in a prison in my mind; so scared
I don't wanna be this way, nah
I don't wanna feel this way, nah
I don't wanna die this way, why am I this way?
Wish I had wings so I'd fly away
Nothin' around me, up where the clouds be
I'm the real definition of drowning
My pain and my head keeps pounding
How's he even living in the state he's at?
Left the pain, swear I'd never go back
But it's right here and it's quite clear that it's not leaving
Does anybody hear me?

[Chorus: Sean Simmonds]
I cannot face this alone (I need You, I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You, I need You)
I cannot face this alone (I need You, I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You, I need You)

[Verse 3: NF]
I was a little bit numb, little bit frozen
Kinda hard to see when your eyes ain't open
How you gonna breathe when your sin keeps chokin'
You to the point that you feel hopeless?
Hopin' things will turn around
Kinda hard to fly when you layin' on the ground
Jesus is the only reason any of us breathin'
Yeah, so don't get down
You ain't gotta live your life in the cold
Thinkin' nobody out there knows
What you been through, where you been to
Yeah, you ain't gotta live alone
He's Messiah, He's Creator
There ain't no one out there greater
Forget about them haters, accept Christ and make a change-up
Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta die this way
Let Him wipe them tears right from your face
Life's a dream
So you better get back on track; in other the words, I'm saying:
Give Him your pain, give Him your hurt
Faith is way more than just going to church
Making your money and going to work
You don't give it to God? You'll watch everything burn, yeah
And this ain't no game
Living without Him is just so insane
People, they livin' for money and fame
Things never change 'cause we living the same
I don't wanna be alone; hate the cold
I'm so broken, I'm so froze
But no longer
'Cause I got my Jesus, and he makes me stronger
[Outro: Sean Simmonds]
Yeah, woo!
I can not face this alone (I need You, Lord, I need You, Lord)
I can't get by on my own (Like the fly what meets the rain, I need You)
I can not face this alone (Alone, I need You)
I can't get by on my own (Lord, I'm here, Lord, I'm here)
Beggin' You, beggin' You, please
I'm down on my knees
I need You, I need You
Ayy, oh, I need You, I need You
Lord, I can't make it without You, make it without You, no
No, Lord, I can't make it without You, make it without You alone2Embed"

Hey, welcome to reality
Yeah
Sometimes, we all get away from that real life
You know sit back and think about, ""What if my life was like this?""
It's crazy
And when you think about it
Kinda like a dream
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine a life where you ain't got no reason to cry
It ain't hard to tell the truth when there's no reason to lie
Picture everything bad that ever happened to you
Snap it in two then laugh at those that laughin' at you
Imagine your pain disappears like magic
Everything that ever hurt you never happened
Your dad never left, your mom never cried
Your relationships' perfect, and nobody dies
You feel far from reality yet
I do, so I'mma bring reality back
You never met your dad, gone since you was a kid
Matter fact, he left before you even cried in the crib
And you momma always cryin'
Startin' to mess with your head
To the world, you alive
But to yourself, you're dead
Look in the mirror, heart's so full of rejection
So you cock your fist back, then crack your reflection like
[Hook]
Yeah
I don't like the way that I feel
Lookin' for reality, but this ain't real
What am I supposed to say, yeah

Imagine everyone you knew respected you
Put your name up high when they mentioned you
Never talked about you bad behind your back
And what they say is what they do
And what they are is how they act
Imagine every girl you had never hurt you
And every guy you fell in love with didn't desert you
Every lie on the earth was real
And didn't mind really lettin' out the way they feel
But hold up
Let's slow it down for a minute
Oh no! Lies in your face
I don't get it
What happened? I must have been dreamin' again
Another fake friend in your face playin' pretend
Another liar
Yellin' it ain't nothin' but truth
All cryin', screamin', ""I would never hurt you""
Yeah, like we ain't heard that befo'
You want the truth? What you think I'm rappin' fo' like

[Verse 3]
Picture a man that never did nothin' wrong
Got beaten 'til most of His flesh was gone
Put thorns in His head while they laughed and mocked Him
Devil laughin' down in Hell like, ""Yeah, I got Him""
Imagine nails goin' into your palms
Strapped to a cross
Soldiers strechin' your arms
Like a joke, people all gather around
""If you so powerful, then why don't you just come down?""
Your mother cryin' at your feet
Breathe your last breath
You want reality, man that's as real as it gets
The one true God came down to earth to die
Never committed a sin, yet He died for mine
And seems we all so caught up in the crazy life
Die for the world, then we'll know what crazy like
Gotta be blind homie if you can't see it
So think about it next time yeah before you scream it like
