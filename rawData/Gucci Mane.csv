Straight out the lot, three hundred cash (Cash)
And the car came with a blunt in it (Yeah)
Lil' mama a thot, and she got ass (Thot)
And she gon' fuck up a bag (Yeah)
Pull up to the spot, livin' too fast (Yeah)
Droppin' the dope in the stash (Yeah)
In Italy, got two foreign hoes, they DM me (Ooh, brr, ayy)
Drop the top when it's cold (Drop-top)
But you feel the heat (Skrrt, yeah, ayy)

Percocet pill on me (Percocet)
Ice on my neck, baby, chill with me (Ice)
Them niggas that post in the back don't say nothin'
Them niggas will kill for me
Back ends I count in my sleep, on fleek
Hundred K spent on a Patek Phillippe (Phillippe)
Bitch, I'm a dog, eat my treat (Hrr)
Hop out the frog and leap (Leap)
I put them bricks in the fender
My bitch, she walk around like she Kris Jenner (Kris Jenner)
I used to break in and enter
Then Takeoff runnin' like the game of temple (Whew)
It's simple, I play with her mental
Mama said she saw me on Jimmy Kimmel (Mama)

Walkin' with the racks, I'm lookin' crippled (Money)
Fuck on that bitch then I tip her (Tip her)
A nickel for me to take pictures (Nickel)
Not from L.A. but I clip her (Brr)
Double my cup, pour a triple (Actavis)
Fox on my body, no Vivica (Fox on my…)

I don't even like to freestyle for free
I put in the key and I ride the beat
I won't even come out the house for free
I pay a nigga to drive for me (Huh?)
JAY-Z couldn't even co-sign for me
I do what I want 'cause I'm signed to me (Damn)
I get the, I get the, I get the bag
They get the bag, have to cut it in half (Wop)
Stop the comparin', y'all makin' me laugh
Need the rehab, I'm addicted to cash
Convertible Wop, convertible top
My dope got a vertical, look at it hop
Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, and it jump out the pot (Pot)
Came out of jail and went straight to the top
Take it easy, baby, middle of summer, I'm freezin', baby (Burr)
Don't leave me, baby
Just drop to your knees and please me, baby (Go)
I'm fascinated, two bitches so fine that I masturbated (Ha)
Congratulations, she brain me so good that I graduated (Wow)
They had to hate it
I don't fuck with them niggas, they plastic, baby (Heh)
A trapper, baby, I rap but I own all my masters, baby
It's tragic, baby, I pull up and fuck up the traffic, baby (Ha)
A savage, baby

Southside
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them one what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, ho, pull your panties up
'Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philippe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty but this ain't a lil' boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get left-overs out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this 'less I'm drunk or I'm high

The kid back on the whiskey
Virginia Black got me tipsy
I'm in L.A. like I'm Nipsey
Spanish girls wanna kiss me
A nigga wanna come and diss me
And put a hex like a gypsy
They kill themselves, no wrist bleed
Got suicides on my SV
She do it all for the Fendi
She do it all for the Gucci (Gucci!)
Baby girl wanna choose me
She wanna use and abuse me (Uh)
I know she wanna text me (Wow)
I know she wanna sex me
Fifty thou' make her neck freeze
Fuck her once like, ""Next, please""
My nigga, who would've thought? (Huh?)
My nigga, who would've thought now?
I'll be right back at the top now
I'll be right back at the top now
I got your girl on my finger
Blowin' my phone like she's single

Say I, a star was born last night
Way you showed out on that dick, girl, you performed last night
That's why you deserve that first-class flight
Buh-bye, 'cause I just quenched your thirst last night
I'm in Dubai
Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived
If I lived over here, I'd probably have one hundred wives (Damn!)
Walkin' in the club and they like, ""Gucci just arrived"" (Gucci!)
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky
I told her I'm a'ight, now she look like she surprised (I'm a'ight)
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise
Bum, bum-bum-bum, I feel like Rocky in his prime (Bum, bum-bum-bum, bum)
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time?
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime
I know you got expensive taste and I don't even mind

I fuck with shawty cause she very loyal
We can tie the knot like Memph and Toya
I won’t ignore you and I won’t divorce you
Let's have two girls and call them Rolls and Porsche
I respect that girl, I accept that girl
I’ll do anything I can to protect that girl
If I could do it all again, would have kept that girl
But I’m unhealthy for you baby I fuck up your world
You your Daddy's lil girl, but you’s a grown lady
And I don’t see you like he see you cause we not related
We got faded at my spot, I swear we're so wasted
After the third shot of patron, I swear can’t even taste it

They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you
They ain’t got nothing on you

Middle of the winter I pull up in a vert
It's the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt
Santa Claus of the hood
I pull up with the work
They call me East Atlanta Santa
Run up on me get murked
I'm just trappin' through the snow
Sellin' nine half a bricks in four ways
Over the hills we go
Got an extendo and an AK (gra, gra, gra)
I'm a neighborhood philanthropist
I'm sellin' bales of cannabis
Preachin' like an evangelist
But I don't fuck with amateurs
I drive spiders, yeah, tarantulas
My diamonds are immaculate
I'm not on no romantic shit
But I'm cookin' cocaine, candle lit
I'm so trill, your ho can't handle it
But damn, that bitch can suck a dick
Skeeted on her face and lip
Guwop can't fuck no basic bitch
The teacher teachin' arithmetic
Show you how to whip a brick
Learn you how you run your clique
And told you how to kill a snitch
My young girl she a freaky chick
But damn she on that sneaky shit
Ran off with a half a zip
And now I got to slap a trick
All these record labels broke as shit
Ricky Dinky record shit
I sell more meth than a Mexican
My dog food yea its excellent
I done started sellin' Christmas tree
I'm tryna jingle bells ho
Its Christmas time its Hollis, Queens
I'm stompin' in my shell toes
Christmas time in '96
I asked Santa for twelve golds
But now Guwop got gifts to give
But I don't fuck with twelve though

Since a jit, I've been slangin' dick, Gucci Mane the shit (Burr)
I met a girl name Susie, I let her join my group
I know she not a groupie, so I let her in my coupe
I stashed her in my fender wall and stashed her in my tire
Susie is a money maker but that bitch a liar

Pull us over Candler Road, said she had some priors
Ten bricks in my car, shawty singing like Mariah
Singing like the choir, better yet singing like Mya (Bitch)

They call me crazy so much, I think I'm starting to believe 'em

Still can cook a deuce up with both eyes closed (Skrrt)
A lot of people still got a lot of shit to say
About the clothes and the pics I post (Huh?)
But it's a beautiful day outside today (Yeah)
Don't know what car I'ma drive today
Promoter just brought me two hundred grand
And I'ma count it by hand, all hundreds, with both eyes closed

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I've got a chick so fine, make a blind man see her (Woo)
She runnin' through my mind, that's a fine idea (Yeah)
And I ain't Blake Griffin, I don't drive no Kia (Huh?)
If it ain't ten mil', I can't sign no deal (No)
I'm all about a check, fresh Nikes, let's do it (Checks)
And I spy a bitch that wanna straight get to it (I spy)
Trap tutorial, ridin' down Memorial (Yoom)
From the bando to the Waldorf Astoria (Woah)
If you don't like to see niggas shine, then close your eyes then (Huh)
We on a private island, vibin' to violins
Autobiography, Gucci Mane the author
And I'm the trap sponsor, Gucci Mane's the father (Yeah)
An eight-figure nigga just walked into Walter's (What?)
If you ain't gettin' money, then move out of Georgia (Go)
Hundred tapes and goin', go check my discography (Woah)

Made a hundred thousand on the one-eyed stove (That's right)
Two-tone Wraith and a two-tone PP
Walked out of Gucci with the two-tone GG (Tell 'em)
Bulletproof Rhino, coke color albino
Yeah, my sauce A1, no Fogo de Chão
Makin' money in piles, sellin' people the pyro
Click the link in the bio, I'm the illest that I know
I'm the illest to rivals, all my cars got a title
Had to rock just like Tidal, sell a preacher the Bible
I'm a hustler for real, sell a hospital vitals
Sell my cousin some Adderall 'cause he takin' his finals
Tity Boi your highness, make it through any crisis
All I do is look straight, all the bullshit behind us
Got the 'Ye on the bracelet, got the 'Ye on the frame
Got the 'Ye on the watch, wore the 'Ye to the game

Ran through my first million playin' on the West Coast (Trap)
Keep some pretty girls 'round me everywhere that I go
We made it out the streets, pop a bottle, let's make a toast
I run circles 'round square niggas with a blindfold
She said, ""Let's make love"", want me to fuck with my eyes closed (What?)
But lil' mama so fine, when she took her clothes off
I went straight in it, both eyes closed
(You crazy, bruh)

Hands down, iced up, white and rose gold (Yeah)
She walkin' 'round my penthouse in my Versace robe (Hah)
Since a juvenile, I stuck to the G code (Uh-huh)

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I don't usually do this, but the drink has got me moody
Got me thinking 'bout decisions, man, I shoulda left with Juve
Got me busting with my cutie, I can't trust her nor her booty
Every night, she acting new-school, I am not gon' be a student
I got class, I got trash, I got bills, I got pills
Heard them boys gon' write me off, I hope they also writing they wills
I got beam, I got flash, I got dreams and nightmares past
I'm allergic to the *brrrr*, I'm using wings to wipe my ass
Right now, I'm high as shit, I'm on the Bumbu, straight
I just got out my bitch, felt like the Sunken Place
She give me drunken face, she give me highest praise
And when I'm in LA, I'm smoking Kobe Bryant eighths
I watched my father whip the yay up like some mayonnaise
Moms would come home, they would argue, he didn't put away the plates
Taught me how to do my dirt and clean up at the same time
Right now, I'm on a couple percs and leaning at the same time
Remix, baby! Tunechi

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got so many felonies, I might can't never go to Canada
But Drake said he gon' pull some strings, so let me check my calendar
I just popped me one of them what-you-call-its and it boosted my stamina
Now I'm fucking her on the banister, guess I just East Atlanta'd her
I'm in an all-red drop tarantula, fuck a Challenger
Damn, these hoes ain't got no manners, bruh, where's the manager?
I keep throwing rubber bandies up, hoe, pull your panties up
Cause you fuck like a granny fuck, you're just an amateur
This Patek Philipe gon' make this crooked judge try throw the book at me
I look like half a million worth of heroin when she look at me
But you ain't gotta fuck with me, my nig, but you're stuck with me
But how you called the cops on me, my nig? You grew up with me

[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now

[Verse 3: Drake]
Yeah, I'm both
Yeah, I had a drink, yeah, I smoked
Yeah, you think I need you, but I don't
Just left out Dubai with all my folk
Open water, my location is remote
Shout-out Yachty, but this ain't a Lil Boat
This some shit I wrote about when I was broke
See, the power of the mind is not a joke
Man, I said that I would do it and I did
Used to get leftovers out the fridge
Nobody was famous where I lived
'Til I got it jumping at the crib
Took a lot to be able to give, I mean
[Chorus: Drake]
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now, got me talking about my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high
But I'm both right now and I need ya in my life
I don't usually do this unless I'm drunk or I'm high

Dancing all night ten grand make you dance, dance
Hundreds in my pants turn your chick to my girlfriend
Gucci in the batter's box I just walked out the bullpen
Pitching dog food, make a junkie out your husband
Hundred stacks'll make 'em shoot you clean in your dad hat
Catch you at the trap and shoot you clean out your Hellcat
Everybody wanna be the kingpin, man
The feds snatched 'em up, now we ain't seen this man
2017, everybody get high
Taking street drugs like they ass can't die
And I ain't tryna preach 'cause I got high too
I'm an ex-drug dealer, nigga how 'bout you
I'm an ex-con, ex-hood, long with a dope bomb
Niggas don't make twenty-one where I come from (Wow)

In every neighborhood there's a Gucci
The neighborhood dealer with an Uzi
Baby started off right as a good girl
Now she's tryna act hard like a hood girl
Tryna catch a nigga playing for the Falcons
But steady sucking up the nigga with the dragons
Diamonds on my neck and wrist lit, it's a combo
Yellow bitch, her dark skin friend, call it gumbo
Pull up in a lot and the car cost a condo
Leave with your chick but send her back with a grand though
Yeah, yeah, it's Gucci Mane and Metro
If Metro don't trust you I'ma foot you in your asshole
Yeah, I started from the bando

Gotta have bricks, yeah, that makes sense
Yeah, I make hits, but I still take bricks

So Icy CEO, I'm a fool with the snow
They think I'm putting VVS jewels in the coke
My watch a cool hundred, paint-job a cold twenty
And after this flip, I'm quitting the trap cold-turkey
Psych, the pack in and I'm working
Drought season in, charged your ass a whole thirty
But right now you can get it for a low number
The fish scale white, same color my Hummer
Zone 6 polar bears never see summer
It's winter all year cause the birds fly under
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
I'm ballin' like an athlete but got no jumper

So many bricks I can build my own apartment
You better have a check when you come in my department
Yes, I break 'em down and I sell 'em whole
Try me, watch your whole crew fall like some dominoes

A hundred thousand off a cap, that's a trap star

Riding with them bricks got me feeling real cautious

I took something, I'm gutter, bitch
Don't trust me dawg, this that North Memphis shit

Bad bitch from Fort Lauderdale, said she love them solitaires

Four mil for the crib, one point five just to keep me chill (One point five)
Who my neighbors is? Jack and Jill, still trap up the hill (Through the hill)
Fiji water, talkin' Aquafina, glass, crystal clear (Clear)
Ice there, ice here (Ice), I just iced the atmosphere

You ain't spent a million yet, you probably won't agree with this
Make jewelers compete for us, we keep on coppin' pieces (It's Gucci)

R.I.P. To Pimp
And O.D.B

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Getting head from a smart bitch
I’m pourin' up dark shit
And I might just have a change of heart
Better play your part, bitch
Tryna get too smart, bitch
I might just have a change of heart
Got a six-car garage, bitch
But I don’t need you to drive shit
‘Cause I done had a change of heart
Woke up in a mansion, grew up in apartments
And I’m the nigga that broke her heart
Got a car don’t need no keys, baby
Automatic starter, my finger, baby
Point a finger, start fightin' like Springer
‘Cause Gucci Mane ain’t no average
Got a girl, don’t need no weed, baby
You my dope, I'm your fiend, baby
Like Billy Dee, get in my ride
And girl, get out my dreams, baby
Work on your footwork like Hakeem, baby
All this green between me and you, lady
Put half on a baby with my homeboy
‘Cause every time I ain’t tryna have no baby
Smoking on kush got my eyes real lazy
You can ride me, baby, then drive me crazy
Rolling up half a pound, no shirt ‘cause girls around
All this money on me, girl, I’ll treat you special
Let me be the manager, girl, I can help you
Let me be the treasurer, get you a bezel
And you can be my trafficker, send you wherever, baby
[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Like Pun and Joe, I don’t wanna be a player no more
Zone 6, I can’t be your mayor no more
Took all my jewelry, all my money, threw it out the door
Brick Squad goin’ broke? Nigga that’s a “hell no”
Am I fresh nigga? Yes, yes
And my bitch dressed nigga, yes, yes
Dress so fresh I impress myself
And I’m smoking on a pound of the realest
Yes or no, am I over dressed?
Asked for a pick up, said “hell yes”
Asked for the dick I said “hell yes”
“Do you wanna fuck me?”
She said “hell yes”

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Baby, I’mma go out my way just to please you
Please don’t leave me now, girl, ‘cause I need you
I’ll cut these hoes off right now, I really need to
And I don’t even know why, girl, but I believe in you
You’ve been stuck on my mind since you laid eyes on me
And I don’t like your hatin’-ass friend because she lied on me
And I just touched down, I made my girl so proud
I know her inside out, I know her upside down
And plus that girl stay down through all my ups and downs
Even the thought of losing her…
Some niggas might say no to drugs
All my crew say “hell yeah”
We don’t go get one pair, we go get twelve pair
All my niggas got brick fair, all my niggas got brick fair
At the Falcons game, and your bitch there
I was worth ten mill’ when Vick was here
And the same ‘hood you can’t come to
That’s the one, my mama pay rent there
Spin the globe, every point i’ve been there
I went platinum in Australia

And I'm the meth man, you better call Redman up
I'm by myself man, and yes I ran my bread back up
You'll have better luck tryna rob a Brinks bank truck
Eight ounces and a Crush soda
Last month I damn near smoked a Range Rover
I buy a pint, crack the seal, and put a straw in it
I'm drinking raw out the jar, caviar sipping
I might need a new prescription
These young hoes fucking senior citizens
Dad, your little sister is granddaddy mistress, sad
Secretary sucking politicians, you mad
You know that Mr. cheating on his Mrs
Remember when I could just take a bitch to Wendy's
But now these hoes say they wanna go to Sicily
But bitch you must be silly, wanna go to Piccadilly
Cause I really feel you fake as hell, like Milli Vanilli

[Hook]
These hoes, must of these niggas go broke for these hoes
Big bad bully but he beat for these hoes
Married thirty years but he sleep with these hoes
Spending all this money, going out to eat
M.O.B. means money over bitches
These niggas say they real, but they just a bunch of bitches
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
[Verse 2]
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
So many chickens in my kitchen got my palms itching
You sucking a rich nigga dick, you in a good position
You say your baby daddy broke? Bitch you really tripping
What's wrong with you, what kind of life you living?
You wanna ball, hit the mall, or just eat Church's Chicken
Gucci be really pimping, I need just thirty minutes
And if you cool baby we could fuck every Wednesday
But you must pay attention, baby you got to listen
The first rule, that you cannot have hoes in my business
You know I ball relentless, pull up in Benz and Bentley's
And I don't wanna meet your daddy, I ain't fucking friendly
I had three-hundred-fifty-thousand, I was only twenty
Your baby daddy broke, I bury his ass in fucking twenties
Yeah I'm a fat nigga, but all I ride is fucking skinny's
And I don't wanna fuck that bitch cause she too fucking skinny

Sittin’ court-side at All-Star
And this? Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And y’all wasn’t wearing gold watches
‘Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh! lawnmower, just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces, man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh! Encore, they want more, they’re fans now
Got your girl ass clapping, hands down
Don’t approach me with your hands out
Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
It’s me, and I’m cool with it
You don’t know what to do with yourself
When I do it, I’m doing it fresh
Born to do it, so I do it to death
Calm in the steps, walking my dawgs
We don’t get along, I’m tellin’ ‘em fetch
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Shoot up the spot and I’m leavin’ like “Ah!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex
[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If you keep whining, baby, you gon’ lose me
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
So fine that I let the girl use me
But I don’t ever get used up, usually (turn up, turn up)
Baby use, me – baby, use me
Baby use, me – baby, you can use me
Baby use, me – you can use me

If you’re an ugly ho, I can’t leave with ya
If you’re a broke nigga, can’t smoke weed with ya
If you ain’t a boss then I can’t sip lean with ya
I’m not a rapper, bitch, I’m a mob figure
4-58, it’s a centrepiece
These ho niggas ain’t seen half a million
Got a pimp cup, I’m in the strip club
And the difference is these hoes ask for me
LaFlare, nigga, I’m rare, nigga
Caveman Shit Drag Her By Her Hair Nigga
You a bear nigga? Well I’m a bear killer
You a fuck nigga, I don’t fuck with ya
2 Chainz, nigga, my cuh-cuh
All my cousins sell drugs
My brother sent a pack, I fell in love
And told everyone I know I sell bud
[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
All I rock is designer clothes
All I take is designer drugs
So geeked up couldn’t find the club
Woke up on the beach with a bag of bud (damn)
2 Chainz, two times, got major money
More money than a label tryna sign a thug
And ya CEO say he wanna sign with me
‘Cause the artists you’ve got ain’t hot enough…

Walk up from my spot, sit down, have a seat
I just been in 5 shoot outs last week
He bought the run division, plus he moving in the kitchen
Nobody make a move, nigga, when Scooter handling business
Reaching in his pocket, Gucci slap him with the pistol-

[Bridge: Gucci Mane]
Get your bitch ass down nigga, motherfucking move nigga
Hood rich!

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Brick strapped to your sister I'm a send her in a rental
I don't give a damn about her, but I'll make millions with the tender
I got money in the fender, tryna buy my kids Christmas
Me and Scooter ain't twins, but we got twin choppers
Got Waka Flocka Flame, a nigga hit em with the yapa
I'm a street nigga, never be a partner to a copper (No)

[Verse 3: Young Scooter & Gucci Mane]
What the fuck going on nigga?
Who the fuck let these police ass nigga in here?

I can see with one eye open like Slick Rick
Fuck the police that's why I rap about them bricks (Me too)
[Verse 4: Gucci Mane]
I ain't Diddy nigga, but these bricks get remixed
When the chopper start spitting, nigga head 'gon get split
Nigga robbed me at the carwash, that was 1996
Ever since the day, them niggas ain't tried me since

God damn, bruh
Talkin' 'bout a nigga robbed you in '96
No, you geeked up, boy

You still gotta pay though

Shooter on the Scooter, bring them bows
He want them right now, he just came from way up the road
Ten millimeter with thirty shots, make your fuckin' head explode

[Verse 7: Gucci Mane]
I got a trap house mansion with some hard wood floors
Can't come in, I got burglar bar doors
Trap going crazy, but I got it under control
I just bust 'em open, fix 'em up, and move 'em out the door
Who this nigga in this Buick, man get Scooter on the phone
I'm like a NBA coach 'cause I keep shooters at my home

[Verse 8: Young Scooter]
All I know I never seen his face in my life
Street smart so I know this nigga ain't right
Pull up at my spot, cut your car off hit your lights
Before you hit the door, you get robbed on sight

Mi casa su casa partna, mi casa so full of rastas
More ganja than reefer farmers, you couldn't see me with binoculars
White girl with me, Cindy Lauper, multi deep like Frank Sinatra
Gave ten birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop 'em, Moreland Plaza
Flow sick like the morning after, try me then your skull get fractured
Ransom your little handsome son, so sad that your first daughter captured
Gucci hot as boiling water, my pack just came cross the border
Your girlfriend's a major snorter but that bitch ain't worth a quarter
Don't give that another thought-a, if you serve me then get shot up
Ounce, a half, a eighth, a quarter, send my goons to do the slaughter
Hustle hard, got from my father, take no shit, got from my mother
Never snitched and never will, I put that on my baby brother

Only one dude and I'ma smoke my reefer
Cruise through the city in my new two-seater
Stay lowkey, get dough with my people
Maybe try to find me a blow a little cheaper
Only one dude and I'ma ride around town
Work got low, bitch dropped a few pounds
Count a few checks, deal 'em out
Shoot a little dice, blow a little loud
Sell a little powder, make a few thou'
Turn them into millions standing tall as Yao
Mean mug every nigga on my team
Nigga say anything, folk will hit him in his mouth
Back in the day, they said I wouldn't be shit
Tell them fuck niggas, ""Nigga, look at me now!""
Money on my dick, they worse than they bitch
It don’t make no sense, we just laugh at them clowns
Pull up to the club, everybody like, ""Wow!""
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
Catch me in the club, I'm stunting on the couch
Balling like a baller, me and Gucci ballin' out

Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper

So I'm like a baby, shittin' like a damn Pamper
Ooh, they hate my swag cause these bars is Alaska

Bricksquad Records like the damn Gambinos
The shit that I done did has only been done by Latinos
Dope so good you think it came from El Chapo
[Chorus]
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo
3 Billion dollars in pesos
All I wanna be is El Chapo
And when I meet him, I'ma tell him bravo

[Verse 2]
Plane just touch down thanks to Amado
Best coke in the world going through your nostrils
Plugs steady send the dope in by the boat load
Severing niggas heads off like El Loco
A hundred bricks is nothin' if you Jesus Elizando
My big toy Emilio got it in the choke hold
Spent a half a million last year on Forgiatos
And no I am not a catholic confessin' is a no no
So many bricks of brown and white you know we got a snow roll
Coke so clean every one brick is a combo
A little handgun in every pocket in my cargo
And it's a stack for a kilo if you get it in the jungle

[Chorus]
All we wanna be is El Chapo
At least all the street niggas I know
All I wanna be is El Chapo
Fully automatic slice your auto
All I wanna be is El Chapo

Hoping the law don't catch me grittin' out here pushing that white
Serving fiends, smoking out of homemade pipes
I'm a thug from the mud, I've got the block in my blood

A bitch that Gucci Mane can't get, man that bitch don't exist
This dick so good, I take it from her, she might slit her wrist
Bling blaww burr, I put diamonds on her clit
Fucked her in the air, yeah she ride me on the jet
His and her fur, yeah I bought my chick a fit
Like Edward Scissorhands, yeah she cut up on that dick
G-g-g-good God, so why she standing back like a pic?
Spaghetti straps in my Maybach, she showing off her tits
She ran off on the plug, so I'ma smash her at the Ritz
S-skeeted in her mouth so now she talkin' with a lisp

Three girls and one Gucci Mane goddamn I'm goin' in
All these Franklins on me man I said my name was Ben
Magic City Monday night, I just threw up a ten
Nigga with a attitude I feel like Cube and Ren
These two ice cubes in my ear they cost a quarter M
That pussy hairy scarin' me, goddamn she need to trim
The way that bitch took care of me she might get her a Benz
She suck me 'til it tickle me, slow down the neighbors listenin'
I got on like ten necklaces, you know my diamonds glistenin'
She fucked me then she shot me with her friends, I think she trickin' me
Her nigga know about me but goddamn he can't get rid of me
She st-t-t-stutter step, around the suite in lingerie
I beat it up like MMA she drank it up like Alizé
Eight Latinos in my room I feel like it's the fifth of May
Pull up on the kid, you dig?
But bitch I ain't got time to play

You waiting on me to fall you need to wait on your income tax check
I got so much money I left the mall with every damn bitch
And for the Panthers raise your arm up then you make a balled fist
They moved my nigga so far away cause they say he was high risk
His folks can't even come down to see him, barely can pay they damn rent
And now he frustrated, incarcerated and it got us all tense
And if them folks try to give me forty ima jump the damn fence

Walk around with these thigh pads

You feel bad but im not sad
You can talk trash but I moved on
Three homes, ten phones
Tell me where did it go wrong

Aka that’s my stash
Nigga try to take my cash
Bet the nigga gon' die fast
50 bands in the brand new pants
Take $5000 and I wipe my ass

Baby freeze, I know a nigga look like 900 keys
Baby say my ring look like a hundred Ps
I got college bitches fallin' out calm down breathe
If yall keep runnin' on the stage then I'mma have to leave
I'm bout to drop the top so I can feel the summer breeze
Its a cold blooded motherfuckin rollie on my sleeve
It feels like I'm the freshest nigga out or is it me
He getting a lil' money but that nigga isn’t me
G-U-C-C-Icy I'm the one girls wanna see

Can we pretend that I'm your man and that makes you my girlfriend
And we have a one night stand in my brand new Benz
And we ain't gotta worry bout nobody peeping in
The windows tinted black so it ain't no lookin in
Bitches talking bout my house, I think they tryna climb the fence
They say that when my dick come out that it's a big event
Pool in my backyard, do you like to swim?
Cause imma work you out and I'm not talking bout the gym
Gucci just got out but God damn he goin in
These lil' boys don't ball like Guwop, he play above the rim
Women on my page like damn he gettin slim
Caucasian women see me and be like is it really him?

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Money owed, dope sold bitch you already know
White birds black birds serving pigeons and crows
I whip the dope so good, a benz jumped out the bowl
Motherfuck the ATF and the border patrol
Me and my amigos at the table shots of Don Julio
I fucked your bitch a week ago, but I ain't gonna fuck her no more (Psych!)
I got the stacks under the mattress so I sleep with the dough
I got them bricks stuffed in the wall so yea I live with the coke
It's Bricksquad and I know you niggas mad cause you broke
He seen my video on the TV and he broke the remote
I'm like Pablo in his prime, shoulder deep with the snow
I read yo paper work nigga man yall niggas some hoes

[Hook: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm a fly nigga to be exact
And I been on some the fuck the world shit lately
Cause I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I fuck fly bitches to be exact
And I been on some fuck the world shit
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I got all eyes on me like Pac did
But I ain't trying to go broke like Joc did
I ain't trying to fuck my dealer did like Block did
I'm trying to stack them free bands like Rock did
Tell the truth I never thought that I get this big
I think I'm about to buy some choppers like Tip did
I came in, flexing jewelry like Flip did
Got every penny out the 6 I swear I milked it
That Bricksquad shit I built it
I put Flocka in the game and he killed it
I did a song with Lil Wayne and I killed it
My only wish my nigga Dunk was here to rip shit (It's Gucci)

[Hook: Future]
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks

And I been on some fuck the world shit

[Verse 3: Future]
My uncle Ronnie died from smoking cane
My cousin suicidal, he blowed out his brain
They gave my nigga 30 years, he in a chain gang
I just had to drop a 40 racks up on my ring
I'm in Giuseppe's walking in the rain
I can't even help it I been through some things
I put my heart in every verse and when I'm on that plane
I'm thanking God for all my watches, and all my chains
I'm in Chanel and I'm in Ferragamos
These bitches know I'm worth these commas
They know I got that llama
And my lil sister just got out that coma
That sickle cell hurtin' her bones
Free my nigga Bomma

Niggas baller-blockin', hatin' on a killa movement
Out the bed to grits and eggs, head and sum booty
I'm young doing numbers and all the women love me
Just because I'm gutter, Black, got a bank and I'm thuggin'
I never love a broad 'cause I'm a motherfuckin' dog
You can ask a couple about me, bet they tell you I'm off the wall
I got doctors, lawyers, dealers, even strippers on my team
And I never show favoritism, everyone's treated the same
I'm a boss of all bitches, so they never complainin'
They respect this gangsta shit, 'cause I got so much game

Me, I got my own back
I'm the CEO, CFO, account manager, and security

Who the only one you trust? (me)

When I got beef, man, who I run to? (me)
She live with you, but why she riding with (me)?
Bags of kush, who my weed man? (me)
PTs, BTs, man, who my lean man? (me)
So much jewelry, I got a million on (me)
Versace down, these hoes keep kissing on (me)
Yellow diamonds, dripping, pissing, say I rap explicit
In the kitchen whipping, doing the dishes, I'm my own assistance
I hit a lick so low cuffed on myself, then I took me to Lenox
If you ain't getting no money with me then what you doing with me?

[Hook]
Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a ""we""
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me

Fucking and sucking me, but I know the bitch running game on me
And she put the thang on me, why you put the blame on me?
That's a shame on me, and her credit card on E, car on E
So, yeah, she put her mouth on me
Put it on freeze is a mini disease
Powerful me, can you do it for me?
Shopping for you like I'm shopping for me
Like I'm trapping for you but I'm trapping for me
Boss of a nigga but working for me
Struggle for you but she cuddle for me
Boss of my label, I'm rapping for me
And where would I be if it wasn't for me?
Tony Montana Six wasn't for me
Wasn't for you and she wasn't for me
Don't leave it to beaver, man, leave it to me
Looking at me and I'm jam of the week
Riding through the through with the top in the teeth

Gucci bilingual, I'm talking to ti

With a touchdown, I'm a front this shit to me
Give it to me, leave it to me
You screaming, ""Why did it happen to me?""
Your girlfriend squirting and spitting on me
I guess baby girl happy to see me
Got a trapping disease, smoking disease
Them hustlers ain't welcome? I'm happy to leave
Your uncle and brother be coping for me
10 bales of the weed in they family trees
Snitch of the force, say you got it from me
Average go broke it won't happen to me
Don't got jumper but putting up the numbers
So much cash I need another machine

Don't need a road manager, managing me
Manage the dope and the weed and the lean

Diamond chains, tennis chains, assault rifles, gambling
Sellin' dope and trickin' folks that run in my family
My daddy was an alcoholic, momma she's a junkie daughter
Cousin smokin' crack, I guess she forgot all my aunt done taught her
Plus I got two brothers that I don't know from a addicted father
And all the pain I caused my mother, bet she wish she had a daughter
Sellin' sets out my momma window, tryna' get a new starter
Treat Sun Valley like Decatur, mountain park like port Arthur
I know my family dysfunctional
So God please help these country folks
Tired and broke, in need of hope
Sheetrock, heroin, crack, and coke

And people won't be happy til I'm confined to Georgia Regional
The third week out of rehab, man, he forget the shit they teachin' him
Like why you smokin' blunts and sippin' lean and you a millionaire
Wrecked my yellow lamb, high on drugs I didn't give a care
Smashed my black Ferrari two weeks later, now it need repair
Demons in my ear, got me seein' things wasn't even there
People in my circle say they care, but they don't really care
But I can't blame nobody but myself, it starts with myself
Cause rap can bring you wealth, but that wealth can destroy your health
Lookin' in the mirror at myself, had to catch my breath
And tell myself that ""Gucci, you an addict!"" That's the first step

Huh
Aye, Lil Metro on that beat
Helpless, please help me
I'm helpless
When she put that pussy on me I feel helpless
Huh, Metro, Guwop

[Chorus]
The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me)

[Verse 1]
Say she got that Sunshine pussy from Harlem Nights
Make you come home, say ""I ain't comin' home for life""
You're like, ""Damn, you don't care if you're wrong or right?""
Goin' hard on that Patrón, girl it's on tonight
I'm addicted, somebody please help me
Is there a pussy rehab? Please tell me
A thousand dollars, for cologne, she smell me
Dick harder than a rock, she felt me
I put it on her so good, she helpless
See me with her girlfriend, she jealous
I woke up with a rich bitch, we wealthy
Talkin' good cardio, we healthy
Expensive lingerie on, she sexy
She asked me when I'm comin' home, she text me
I want head in the morning, fuck breakfast
I'm the best that ever did it, fuck Elvis (Wop)
[Chorus]
The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy
Try to stay away from her but I can't help it
I'm so helpless
(Please help me, huh, somebody please help me)
I feel helpless (please help me)

[Verse 2]
She got a church girl smile but a bedroom body
But this ain't no church girl, this a grown ass woman
Get to diggin' in her stomach, got her grown ass runnin'
Tell me ""hurry up"" 'cause her home girl comin'
Told me beat it up, I say ""You ain't said nothin'""
If you ain't seen her naked, nigga, you ain't seen nothin'
Laughin' but that camel in her jeans mean muggin'
Actin' like we family, but bitch we ain't cousins
Knockin' out the stuffings man, I'm trampoline jumpin'
Tryna set this bed on fire like it's kerosene burning
Dressed up like a naughty nurse like Halloween comin'
I'm addicted like a fiend so I give her green money

[Chorus]
The way she put that pussy on me, I feel helpless
And I want that pussy to myself, I'm selfish (true)
Say she want a nigga like me that's wealthy

The drip shit, I pour it, that Hellcat, I floor it (Skrrt)
They was hatin' on me, hit the dealership and crushed 'em
Bankroll too big, got me held up in customs
Money is the answer every time she ask questions
I got superpowers 'cross the globe, I can touch 'em
That's your girlfriend? I am sorry, we've been fucking

I keep that FN, I go for nothing
If he out of line, get him dropped, end discussion (Go)

It's low down Gucci, steal ya bomb Gucci
Remember when I used to drive an old ass hooptie (fuck it)
Gas packed shawty, dirty cup shawty
And why they call it Mountain Park
It ain't no God damn mountain
I was raised in sun valley wasn't a damn thing sunny
And I can't lie I try to serve every God damn junkie
Smoking gas and drinking mud but you can keep your Budweiser
She's a blunt begging bitch so I don't wanna stand by her
If you pour your ounces up then I don't wanna drink with ya
If you ain't gettin' money I don't wanna link with ya
I bring the pot to the water I could kitchen sink with ya
I had to kick you out the squad, you was the weakest link nigga

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
Gas, gas, you know I got the gas
93 octane, 4 thousand for a bag

I hope you looking for me nigga I'm the one that shot your truck nigga
And if you really wanna go to war then I don't give a fuck nigga
Got em Bentley with the paper tag, book bag full of gas
Pockets can't hold on all the cash, I can loan your ass some swag
And I pull that pistol fast PRPs hang off my ass
You save your money, buy the Jag' but bitch I could go buy a jet
Remember 1996, the year that I robbed my connect

I done did all kind of shit, ya'll niggas just full of shit
I just drunk two pints today tryna drink the pain away

Love drankin' dirty, woke up really late
I used to drank up early, I like the way it taste
Drinkin' on this Actavis, I love to drank the grace
They catch you with these pints my nigga you might catch a case
Flossin' tossin' up, proceed with caution
I'm the boss and I ain't takin no losses
Smoking gas, and I'm sippin' on poison
Pull the arm and I'm a hit my target
Caught a body but I beat my charges
Two Ferraris I got twin horses
New charger and I sat it on forges
G5 touchdown on Moreland
Poppin' pills like I hear voices
Me and Scooter just brought twin Porsches
Louboutins, but I wear em like forces

When I came back to the city bussin jugs
Tell the jack boys I wish a nigga would
On the real my nigga we been gambling good
.44 full, dog, up in the club
I’m obsessed with sipping lean and smoking bud
My mama say the neighbors think I’m selling drugs
I told my mama chill and then gave her a dub
I turnt the stove on then gave mama a hug
Now when these niggas re-up, they re-up with us

Jug, you’re just another damn jug
Bitch don’t even know it, she done met the damn plug
Jug, and I jug so good
Bitch don’t even know it, she can leave the damn hood

Man a nigga set tripping in the wrong damn hood
Call a nigga cuz when he shoulda said blood
Hood nigga know that he gotta show love
Pull up to the club spend a whole damn dub
Hey, it’s your god damn move
You arguing about a bitch and she’s a god damn slut
What? And now you car shot up
Beefing bout a bitch with a glued on butt
Hey, you tryna act all tough

Stamped in god we trust
Stupid waves no brush, she screaming
How he cookin' dope and he ain't using no fork

Wouldn’t make a profit till I first start cooking
I’m standing on the crest like the boulder crest bully
Call your plug and tell that nigga that that Gucci Mane took it
If you lock me up I’m gonna get out and start back juuging
Sun valley apartments and the Neighbors keep looking
Gave a nick to my uncle and I told him how was it
Glass house, straight drop, yeah he loved it
Got a stash house, a scrap house, my trap house bunkin
Flashback, I damn near had to bust my cousin
Playing fucking games with the Gucci man money

Hah

[Verse]
I was piss poor, sleeping on the dirt floor
And we couldn't pay the rent so it's a notice on the door
The neighbors been noticed so what I'ma front for?
Using pennies for the bus like what I'ma stunt for?
Mama workin' like a dog but we still broke
We lighting candles in the house 'cause the lights off
The best thing that ever happened, I got kicked out
Bought me a Chevy, got a grill, now I'm gold-mouthed
I lost my daddy last year, I couldn't even cry
'Cause it's so hard to shed a tear, he didn't even try
The only person in the world I could fully trust
Was my older brother Vic, that's just how it was
Top in the trunk, this for Bankroll and Slim Dunk
I miss that girl Beasley, she was a real one
I had an artist that I treated like my own son
Gave him the shirt off my back and my own gun
R.I.P. to Shawty Lo, Mister Don Don
It's been rainin' so long, when the sun comin'?
I'm drop top but put the top up when the storm comin'
Sometimes I think about my past, it make me start tripping
I was gifted with a talent that was God-given
But I was so hard-headed I would not listen
Sometimes I sit and I reflect about that cold prison
And doin' pull-ups with a nigga got a life sentence
They gave my nigga Grant life, he only gained on me
Five years later, how we in the same room?
You go to jail, that's when you see who really love you
I don't think nobody love me like my auntie Jean do
R.I.P my auntie Jean and uncle Goat too
How you gon' judge me? You don't know what I been through
I think these killers need a hug, I need a hug too
You send a slug, I'll send a slug, you know how thugs do
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through
But I forgive, I been forgiven, I hold grudges too
I'm just a work in progress, I'm not even through

(DJ Meech, lil' bitch)

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Them niggas get on y'all ass, y'all play with me like I ain't worse
Tryna gossip up the blogs like y'all ain't said my name first
He a junkie, he ain't shot his gun yet, he blame Percs
Shot a video and had a shootout in the same shirt
What you know about popping out and trying to hit they face first?
They like Smurk, ""Your ass be tripping, better put your case first""
Choking who? I heard them rumors, niggas better play slow
I don't want no niggas who you catch, I want the one I paid for
We on his ass, he in the A, you see how long they stay for
Ain't no hotel room, we pop outside the Hyatt with dracos
Hellcats, they get off any scene, the police chase those
Trolling ass, we shot your homie, we ain't know he can take those
If I say your name, don't post it, opps be on all kind of shit
Ain't got time to watch your page to see if niggas died or shit
I know bitches set you up, literally, niggas dying to hit
In this industry, ain't what it seem, this shit be counterfeit
Ain't no lacking, she say I'm a nigga from the trenches with a accent
Why you asking me who shot your homie, why you asking?
You got my number, you post shit on the 'Gram, you moving backwards
You lucky I don't be doing shit for the 'Gram, you niggas cowards
[Chorus: Lil Durk & Gucci Mane]
Better not believe no rumors, rest in peace to Koopa
I jumped on the school bus and I had brung a Ruger
Always drank an 8th of Act', I never drunk a cooler
They get your location, they might pop outside in Ubers
When his goofy ass jumped in the streets? His ass a hooper
I know this shit don't matter, I took a shower with a cougar
Bring him out retirement, he gon' kill you for that mula
Catch him in the morning, wake him up, that boy a rooster (Go)

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
He took it to trial, I tried to tell him it was stupid (I knew it)
They gave him so much time, his knees got weak and he was woozy (Damn)
Watch the shit you say, the feds be listening to the music (Woah)
And they gon' take your lyrics and build a case and try to use it
D.A. dropped my murder, didn't have evidence to prove it (Nah)
I think my house is haunted, yeah, by who? The ghost of Pookie (Woah)
He ain't killed nobody but keep rapping about the shootings (Pussy)
Still ain't got revenge yet but keep making up excuses (Wow)
Cuz done drank so much lean that his gut got big as Gucci's (Lean)
Told him quit while he ahead and don't go out like Whitney Houston (Huh?)
He got caught without it, now they robbing him for his rubies (Woah)
He wouldn't give it up so he got buried in his Cuban (It's Gucci)

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
Better not believe no rumors, rest in peace to Koopa
I jumped on the school bus, and I had brung a Ruger

Feel like I’m on a shroom, All this money in this room

I’m a rock star, and I’m gang banging
Skulls everywhere, Spikes everywhere
Bloodhound for that money, Catch me anywhere
I went to space and left some niggas

Death before dishonor, I’ll never tell

From ATL to Philly, nigga
Real recognize real
Yeah, we hood rich bitch
Trap God, turn us up

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I'm a money getting nigga
At least, that's just what I'm known for
You better call on my connect
And ask him what he put me on for
I heard y'all niggas ballin'
Then why the fuck you take a loan for?
Better get the fuck out East Atlanta
You niggas know you don't belong there
All my niggas smoking strong here
We don't talk reckless on the phone here
A lot of cliques don't get along here
Bricksquad my nig, we rock our own gear (Squad)
I'm on the grass, sitting on the lawn chair
I hope that you don't read me wrong
But if I go pull out that tone there
I bet that you don't make it home
I'm in the trap house with my long johns
And I been trapping all day long (Skrt!)
They call me Baking Soda Armstrong
Before it dry, that shit be gone
[Hook: Gucci Mane and Meek Mill]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Rose gold on my bottom six
Half a mill on foreign whips
I'm in the wheel with a foreign bitch
I'm on the bra strap, and she on this dick
Just bow down, you lame
Your diamonds look strange
I'm grinding like Wayne
When he on that skateboard, I'm saying
Nigga your new girl's my old bitch
My old bitch your new girl
Young lil rich Philly nigga
Them hoes tell me I'm too thorough
I don't even fuck one on one
Cause when I come, I need two girls
That's down to fuck like all night
Give them bitches that hard pipe
Riding with with a ho named Keisha
And we smoking on Keisha
Young nigga fresh like Easter
Blood dripping on my sneakers
Straight drop, I stick that
I sell a brick, I get back
That Molly look like a Tic Tac
And I tell that ho that I get it back like 'Whoa'

My nigga Waka got his own car
You on my dick like you a bitch, nigga
Why don't you go and quote your own bars?
And I don't want to go back to jail, nigga
But you gon' make me catch one more charge
I could look and tell you're frail nigga

Wop, money!
Honorable C-Note

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Fluorescent lamps in my crib, providing light for my seeds
I'm a get money marine, I sent coke in submarines
Irrigation machines, hydraulic water machines
My money counting machine sound like a sewing machine
Cash machine on the dresser, machine gun with the compressor
Dope presser machine, I'm re-rocking everything (presser)
Claim I'm laundering money but where the washing machine?
They know my trap house pump out quarters like a slot machine
In a futuristic whip look like a time machine
Old school dropped a lil' one fine machine
Making chips off coke and soda like a vending machine
Dog food with the quinoa in my blending machine
Sip so much Codeine and Sprite I need a soda machine
So I can sit it next to my joint rolling machine
And it's placed parallel to the Carbon 15
With the scope, monkey nuts, and the infrared beam
The machine don't make the man, the man make the machine
So many try to sabotage, can't stop the regime
Call me Wop the puppet master, I'm just pulling the strings
Screaming please don't look me puppet like American Me
Take a tour with me, a down south American G
Tryna flood the dirty south, East Atlantian streets
With this high grade uncut Colombian tea
Yeah I got it for cheap but you ain't get it from me
Got the high grade uncut Colombian tea
Yeah I got it for cheap but you can't get it for free

My money machine, my money machine

8 figure niggas man
When I say boss I mean that, ya heard me?
I'm so fuck what I sold, my toilet seats solid gold
You should see my new palace cause that bitch bigger than Lowe's
I'm a 8 figure nigga, I run the check to the ceiling
Since Gucci came home bitches back in they feelings
I'm in Dubai on parole, I Abu Dhabi my hoes
If she fuck all the rappers, she say hip hop in her soul
100 grand in all twenties, they said that I couldn't
50 grand to my bitch just cause her ex was looking
Red bottom boss, I call the yayo caucasian
Choppers sleep on the couch ready for home invasions
These pussies watching my Snap, they know that I'm strapped
On the road to the riches bitches, I'm running my laps

Yeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at
Man y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back
Now let's bring the trap back nigga, Gucci Mane back nigga

I'm the bestest, I'm the freshest ever stepped on the scene
I mean what I say, I say what I mean
Keep a rocket in my pocket like my name was Hakeem
Somebody had the picture, she thought it was a dream
A college chick dream big man on campus
All these folks impersonate me like Elvis
Too much sauce and I'm not selfish
I rule with a iron fist wrapped in Velvet
The seat way back and the top laid back
Her waist real small but that ass real fat
She get turnt up and you can't turn back
She make my dick stand up, I push them legs way back

I'm the slickest, I'm the richest ever rapped on the track
In the S600 with the seat way back
1017 mob boss, I don't play that
I'll get your whole head knocked off if you say that
I had a long-nosed .38 way way back
I sent a nigga to the pearly gates way-way back
They thought that Gucci Mane was soft now they don't think that
Please get that devilish juice away from me, I don't drink that
My own clothing line Delantic man, yeah I run that
You heard Atlantic dropped Gucci? Why would they do that?
I lost 200k in Vegas, yeah man I blew racks
Man get these broke ass niggas away from me, they ain't worth two stacks

I'm back at em, it's back on
I'm back strong, I'm back home
Me and Flockavelli, and Wooh da Kid
He got a nine, I got a Sig
I do it huge, we do it big
Got hundred bricks, stuffed 'em in the fridge (Burr!)
Two hundred piece, stuffed it in the attic
I'm a drug addict, bitch I gotta have it
I got a gift, I can water whip
I can flip a brick, I can triple up
Need a hundred mill', fuck a record deal
Because a couple millions just not enough
Sell your momma a zip of dust
Serve your daddy a ounce of hard
Got your little sister on the molly
She done went through the whole squad

I ain't mean to be rude boo, but you know I'm that dude, true
More birds than Atlanta Zoo, going in like a curfew
I lost my mind, and my train of thought, and my top all at the same time

I'm an OG like my daddy, I'm a hustler like my momma
I'mma stack my bread all winter so I can ball out all summer
Got foreign choppas, Osama, smoke presidential, Obama

Ain't no quarters, ain't no halves, just some wholes in 'dis house

It's a drought, and my price will make yo eyes pop out
I can't neva count my stash 'cause I always loose count
I can't neva keep no bitch 'cause I put them hoes out
I was corner store and in the motel in it, selling it
You can check my rap sheet, its numerous felonies
I took twenty-three stacks, and bought some jet skis
Have pity for the cop who gotta arrest me
A front street, jump street, then jump out, itss a track meet
Use to have a ten-speed, now I got a Bentley

In the Trap house, in the Trap House, in the Trap House
Gucci Mane Check It

[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account
Junkies going in junkies going out
Made a hundred thou, In my Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
Bricks going in, bricks going out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of selling bricks I wanna go legit
I wonder can I sell 11 mill like 50 Cent
Cause platinum ain't enough I got too many vices
I love to smoke weed love to shoot dices
Say my lifestyle extravagant
I talk cash shit, bitches say I'm arrogant
Well goddamn Gucci cocky then
But at the same time young hoes be jocking slim
""Gucci ain't shit."", Bitch, I beg your pardon
I'm independent but I'm balling like a major artist
I stay high like giraffe pussy
In My Trap House smokin' bubba kushie
[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account

Made a hundred thou, In my Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
Bricks going in, bricks going out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House

[Verse 2]
Jumped out the whip everybody looking
Big clouds of smoke but ain't nobody cooking
(female talking) ""Girl, there go Gucci Mane
I want his autograph cause I'm his biggest fan""
Yellow Humm-V with the yellow feet
Yellow diamonds the same color cheddar cheese
And I'm smoking on that purple shit
They call me temp service cause I'll work a bitch
Money long like Shaq feet
Running dough like a sprinter at a track meet
I heard he got that soft white
Extended clips make them busters get they mind right

[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account
Junkies going in junkies going out
Made a hundred thou, In my Trap House
Money kinda short but we can work it out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
Bricks going in, bricks going out
Made a hundred thou, in my Trap House
[Verse 3]
In my trap house watchin SportsCenter
In the kitchen cooking but I ain't cooking dinner
Splash it with the water whip it make it harder
17 for 'em the same number as Qunice Carter
Say I'm working with wit a mill or better
Married to the game me and money live together
Street smart niggah never listen to the teacher
You can catch me in the bathroom smoking reefer
Prices low like Walmart
Bricks on aisle 9 get ya shopping cart
Knee deep in the dope game
I'm not a farmer but I'm known to push them collard greens

[Chorus]
Choppa on the floor pistol on the couch
Hood rich so I never had a bank account

[Verse]
Start selling weed for my brother, the age was eleven
Thirty off a hundred dollars he working the shipments
Seventh grade Christmas time, momma gave me a fifty
I spent that fifty with the dope man, he gave me two fifties
I owed a fifty but I trapped and I paid him so quickly
I had them dimes so big junkies callin' me biggie
I moved out, paying rent was such a good feeling
I hit a lick, thirty grand fell out of the ceiling
I’m in Savannah and my nigga like king of the city
In Alabama with them hammers they plotting to get me
These suckers tried to take my life on a couple occasions
Been grinding hard, thirty years, never took a vacation
And ever since seventeen, been stuck on probation
I chased a nigga, stabbed his ass now they calling me Jason
I fell out with my homeboy, I swear it was crazy
And we don't really know each other, but having a baby
I travelled all around the world been plenty of places
I'm Gucci, trashbag cash got plenty of faces
In Sun Valley, trapping hard like back in the Eighties
I leave with eighty, spend at least thirty grand in the station
I lost my nigga Dunk and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest
I lost my nigga Dunkin and no one will ever replace him
In Gucci's eyes he will always be one of the greatest

Me and mines were like Bonnie and Clyde and we ain't try pretend
Niggas hurt 'cause they seen that 'Vert drop top, half a M
Steppin' out like a Fiji water, sparklin' with gems
These are Gucci boots they cost two stacks man, these are not no Timbs
I'm so hood, no matter how much I'm still gon' get some rims
Baby lucky if she leave with me 'cause I don't even care
Bitch, Atlantic just mailed me 10 mills and I'm not even there
If you listenin' to just what I said you might be more aware
More concerned 'bout the cash you earn and not the clothes you wear
Wop!

[Chorus]
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings
Coupe a half million, hurt a nigga feelings
Watch a quarter million, hurt a nigga feelings
House ten million, hurt a nigga feelings
I'm up thirty million, hurt a nigga feelings

Fresh outta jail, made bail for the tenth time
Shoulda been said something cause it's been time
You see me smiling but I'm crying on the inside
Thinking bout my homies locked down on the inside
I've been spared so many times, could've been died
Coulda lost my sanity, my brain been fried
It's so hard to understand when it's God's plan
And it's not in my hands but in God's hands
Free my nigga Putang and free Papa Joe
And every soldier ten toes who ain't never told
And free my nigga Slick Ralph and my Uncle Grant
Lord knows I'm asking for a lot but bring my niggas back

And every call, every show, and every video

We tryna move on but it still hurt though
We try to come together but it won't work though
'Cause you's the most important piece to the puzzle

[Verse 1]
I'm Gucci Mane the legend, I don't fuck with you peasants
I'm too heavy to be petty, boy is you balling or begging?
Please stop calling me, nigga, 'cause I can't spare not a second
I gives a fuck 'bout a record, I got a criminal record
These boys so scared of big Gucci, they make subliminal records
Most of these rappers is pussy, they making feminine records
It ain't a nigga in the industry that I wanna meet
Your favorite rapper a sucker that's not surprising to me
You can't be talking to the police then try signing with me
I ain't cosigning these niggas, I'm only vouching for me
I ain't letting these soft ass niggas stand on no couches with me
You niggas wasn't in no trap house sacking up ounces with me, pussy

I'm a business, a building, the man with the millions
Use collateral damage cause boy you just a civilian
You'se a sheep in a wolf outfit boy you just a chameleon
And you blend in good, but I'll hurt more than your feelings
I'm a monster, a mobster, a contract killer
I'm a convict, a conman, an ex-drug dealer
I'm the bricks man, hitman, jack boy, kick man
Knock your door off the hinges, I hit big licks and
All my people like heaters, we don't like features
We love each other, but we don't like people
We crazy and violent and they can't teach us
Preachers couldn't reach us but the hoes gon' greet us
Cause we balling on you suckers, bitch want more on the bleachers
You niggas real dick riders, male cheerleaders
And you can't compete with Gucci so just follow the leader
Cause I'm still that boy from Zone 6 that might follow your Regal, pussy

It's Drop top

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Verse 1]
I'm a ex con, used to sell crack at the Texaco
Known for toting guns and it's what I'm on probation for
Had a murder charge, but they ain't found me guilty though
Keep my head on a swivel, 'cause I robbed a couple folks
And you can call me anything, but you can't call me broke, though
Was damn near 300 pounds, but I lost the weight, though
300 pounds of mid-grade, I took it 'cross the state, though
Got a bunch of tattoos, don't ask my why I got them, though
Got a lot of loved ones, but they ain't here today, though
Really miss my homeboy, he in a early grave, though
Gucci Mane a troublemaker, I'm trying to behave, though
Niggas keep on trying me, I think they feelin' brave, though
People say they cloned me because I changed my ways, though
I fly the dope in on a drone for the pesos
All about the bucks bro, but this ain't Tampa Bay, though
I'm a livin' legend, I do magic with the Draco
In the Peach State, but I'm sellin' Cali grapes, though
And Arizona mid-grade, I swear my life is great, bro
Gucci Mane and Metro, exclusive Jordan retro
I was sellin' half a O trappin' at the Zesto
[Skit]
Aye wassup bruh, ride with me somewhere (Yo)
[?] (Huh?)
Yeah, I told the nigga ""Meet me at the Zesto"" (Dope)
He want a half of one (Go)

[Verse 2]
Gucci super cutthroat, but I was born broke though
Didn't have a pot to piss, so I wanted to throw it out, so
Niggas talk sideways, I hit him in his mouth though
Who you think you talking to? I had to stomp your mouth, bro
Baby got a pretty face but I just want the mouth though
You ain't come to suck me up, then what you in the house for?
Brand new Air Max and they ain't even out though
Drippin' sauce excessively and it ain't even called for
If the jewelry ain't blindin' me, then what it even about for?
Niggas want to sign to me, but I can't even vouch for
Back to back with Ralo, and we ain't even deep though
How yo clique compare to mines and y'all ain't even street though?

Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home
In the place that I said, everything that I meant
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread
If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head

[Chorus]
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night
And you so broke, you looking at us with all this ice

[Verse 2]
Bitch I bigger pay her or get bigger paid, everyday is a bigger day
Bigger nigga get a bigger gun, hit his ass in his bigger face
Bigga Rankin and I fuck with him, half the niggas he with I don't like
That young nigga 'bout trigger play, and my section looks just like nigga day
Reiterate I'm 'bout pistol play, FN what my pistol say
Shoulder deep in this cocaine, but nigga I can hold the weight
Appraise me, I'm a mill' today
A mill, and a mill, made a mill today
Say you wanna do a show, what's the rate?
Told a nigga fifty with a stiff face
Smoking on kush and I'm drinking on grape's, I feel just like I'm Pimp C
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer, so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi
Say Pepsi, fuck you, cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day
[Chorus]
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
She so high, but bitch with me so she good night

[Verse 1: PeeWee Longway]
I ain't neva seen a nigga like me
Where he at, where he from? I'd like to meet him
I'm a rolling stone, cookin' with the Rollie on 32 shots in my Nina
I'm a rolling stone, get my rollie pollie on, fuck it, Aquafina and Katrina
Traffic gas bags in the beemer. (or bimmer)
Pussy bald, head like leukemia
Watch me set it off, like Khadijah
Stuffing my cigar with the diesel
Pull up, jump off for the Keisha
C.O.D., I need my mo-ney-fa
Puerto Rico, and I don't need a visa
Dope white, name: Mona Lisa
Frank White head shot Tito
Longway not Carlito
Boot up off the molly, I don't fuck with the hijo
Porsche 9-1-1 got it out the repo
Trap house, naw bitch, I'm trappin' rollin stizzo
Gas bags, I got them bitches going for the lizzo
Fake chopped glass'll have them J's at the dizzo
I'm runnin' them, I'm a mob boss calling me Sunny
I'm connected with the pharm-ist, got them pints by the hunnids
Whole lot of C notes rubberbandin' my hunnids
Still makin' drug deals out the trunk of my Honda
Leanin' off a double seal, like I'm dumber than dumber
Rollin' off a molly pill, tryna fuck on yo mama

My bitch she servin' up P's and buy different bags then go by Saline
She speak different languages but she Portuguese
She drop in the fishes then whip it up in grease
My trap house but her name on the lease
We might get married like Nas and Kelis
My bad I'm trippin' I'm back on my G
Matte black the Forgi's and SRT8 the jeep
Just got an endorsement from servin' the lean
Thanks to extortion I'm cleaning the streets
Double R Royces I roll them in fleets
My trap house stay rollin' I'm never off beat
I'm baggin' up pounds to a new C Note beat
Trapper and rapper still strapped with them hammer
(I make the dope dance like I'm MC Hammer x2)
Chopin' up pharmacists I'm servin' you the grammar
And lean I get it from over the counter
Chopin' up pharmacists with cameras like Tony Montana

There's a trap in every hood and all the j's want that good dope
Gucci got that clean cause all the snorters want that real coke
Multimillionaire the real La Flare but I feel broke
10 Million dollar mane but I can't hang with these rich folks
My little boy was only 2 he asked me, ""papa, what a roo-poo?""
5 years old closet full of jays; fruit loops
They say Gucci Mane the god of making music people trap to
Drumma Boy the god of making music Gucci snap to
Section 8 apartment and them babies need some fruit loops
Pampers and a bath cause they mamma smoking crack too
How you gone critique me, you industry
I'm in the streets, you out the streets
I murk the streets and murk the beat
I'm Hercules, no murkin' me
Gucci back home making music niggas clap to
He don't never come to the hood unless he have to
Rappin' ass niggas I'mma make my niggas rap you
Its big Gucci, not Bobby V, so ain't no way you jackin' me

Red cars with tint on them so niggas looking but can't see
Paved the way for making trap music so street niggas should thank me
Ain't no way you'll out think me
Ain't no way that you could jank me
And all I sending is head shots cause I don't shoot at niggas feet
Niggas better retreat when they see me
On G.P. shoot up the BP
Nigga died with his gun, couldn'a been me
One deep on the street with a street sweep?
Gucci Man, I'mma shoot you in your pee pee
Get you fucked in jail like a fefe
Niggas know about Flocka & Gucci
Naw we ain't beef he sissy
I'm the type to shoot out Peachtree
You the type that wanna' be me
Bullets just fly right by me
These fuck niggas tried to hit me
You scouts don't get no brownies
One shot just hit my Bentley
Another hit my Charger, but it didn't hurt my hemi

She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Your girlfriend keep callin' me, I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me, so mornin' it's an argument
Gucci Mane be doggin' it, beatin' her down straight poundin' it
Drillin' on your sheets, got your blanket at the laundromat
Way baby girl throw it back, old man might catch heart attack
Gucci Mane now hardly there, smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate, oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet, never been a minute man
Always been a business man, got her catchin' feelings, man
Got a man? Oh really, ma'am? Actin' like I give a damn
Used to like her, now I don't, got a real short attention span

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci, Trey Songz, put it on, my shirt off when I perform
She say this her favorite song, she got on my favorite thong
She so hot, too hot to touch, to feel it, too much for lames
Gucci Mane, I'm extra clean, so extra rubbers on my brain
Got your main thing screamin' Gucci, every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often, but I'm often somewhere flossin'
Lay it down like carpet, Barbie, Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem, pop her 'til she call me papa
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
[Chorus: Trey Songz]
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up

It's Metro
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
I finessed
Huh, whoo
Ahh
I got extra drugs

[Chorus]
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs

I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?

I suggest that you niggas don't fuck with us

I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, in Glocks we trust
[Verse 1]
A conniver, a miser, a plug despiser
A Financial advisor, I make you wiser
I do stunts like MacGyver for my survival
If you a rival, I trick you, watch your tag and title
I'm a slimer, a grimer, a real big-timer
Tellin' lies to the judge with my hand on the Bible
I'm a shyster, I'm spiteful and I love rifles
And I love white folks, I walk on a tightrope
Trick you out your cargo, I feel like Pablo
My hood is a jungle, get burnt like charcoal
Take dope from the narcos and bring it to Flat Shoals
And we take chances, 'cause life is a gamble

[Chorus]
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?

I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?

I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, the more heads we bust
I suggest you niggas don't fuck with us
The more niggas you bring, in Glocks we trust
[Verse 2]
Gucci two pistols, get robbed at the Crystals
I'm a trickster, she love how I'm rockin' my crystals
I can never be a victim 'cause my bruh name Victor
Three brothers, no sister, we so rough with ya
Shy with ya last week, today I gots to get ya
Kick you dead in your ass, tell you ""Take that with you""
It's a lowdown dirty game, no ref, no whistle
No harm, no foul, but the team just blitzed ya
Slap you clean 'cross your head, tell the docs to stitch ya
All that flexin' with that pack, boy, you gots potential
Gon' bust you with the Draco, now you need dentures
Shitbag no tissue, we so rough with ya

[Chorus]
I finessed the plug, I got extra drugs
I thought you fucked with me, Gucci, where's the love?

Put me in the game, I might score a triple-double

Baby, whip that dope like I told you
Never let a nigga fuck you over
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You better never tell nobody what I showed you
You a soldier, you a soldier
Beauty in the eye of the beholder
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
She a down bitch, a motherfucking soldier

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
15K today, 30K tomorrow, nigga
I live life on boats, like I'm sponsored by nautica, nigga
Everything I say's a quote, I just took of them folks
Got a dope bag in my throat, I'm trying my best not to choke
We gonna chase that fucking paper to the ceiling
Zero tolerance for these bitches, they just want chillen
I made a pledge to Migo to take care all my nephews and nieces
Then ran into my Migo then turned to a fucking receiver
I'm receiving, you know I'm cricket like '
I'm a freak, I get the pack, and take all the clothes off they body
I know bitches, that gone come and fuck you and take all your riches
I know math well, me and Gucci spending nothing but digits, get it

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
Now she been riding for a nigga for some years
Cried a river with all them tears, even aborted a couple kids
After I did that other bid, I thought you would've left me, I was down on my dick
But you were still there to help you, you the chef that kept me fed
You see, I ain't scared to say it, it was nothing, just to play it
So I was shooting for the head and I was moving from them feds
Watching every move and knowing whereabouts
Money I make more, fake hoes don't care about
It's like four niggas try to share a house, it ain't gone work, I make 'em tear it down
Get that eviction notice, grip the 40, might let them niggas have it
Scooter and Gucci, you know we causing havoc

Stand and salute like I taught you to
Pistol in the purse like a soldier do
She got the brains and the body and the muscle too
I give a shout out to these bitches cause they hustlers, too
Soldier, soldier, baby girl a soldier
Pulled over, Corolla, she did what I told her
Don't give a damn if they send her ass to Angola
My girlfriend thick, lips look like Crayola
Severing ties, paying bribes, call this shit payola
Cocaina, Coca Cola, concealed with that Folgers
On Boulder-crest with OJ in yeah we got them boulders
I call that bitch lieutenant (....unintelligible...) because that bitch a soldier
