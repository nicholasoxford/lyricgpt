Hello? What the deal? Bet

[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 1]
Button start the foreign, oh my God, I'm gorgeous
I just put the key inside my pocket
Park it, might not get to see it, this a new Ferrari
Man in the mirror, how you choose to bother
Someone said they callin', I don't feel like talkin'
Everything I get returned the way I bought it
Phone be interrupting me while I'm recordin'
Phone be making women feel they unimportant
Call my dog, he say it's all the way retarded
Keep the oil 'cause I am not using the Foreman
Kitchen, I just finished up a new performance
Hater, wish you well
I got clientele
I just got it off the scale
[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’

Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 2]
There they go again, one of my lil friends
They don't give a damn how a nigga been
All they wanna know is what I got to give
How much did I spend? What I got to lend?
What I did and what I didn't do for them
Bricks comin' in somewhere on the rim
Section doin' numbers, nowhere by a gym
Droppin' bottles, spend, I'm supplyin' ten
Jumpin' out a Honda, I just got it in
Askin' what I cop, none of your concern
One day you gone learn what you tryna get
Everything on sale, goin' out of biz
Partners up in jail, gotta feed the kids
Juggin' round the city, you know what it is
Bread winner business, put that on the wrist
[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’

Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’
Trap jumpin' I’m ring, ring, ringin’

[Verse 3]
Ring, ring, ringin' man
Find me balling hard
Come from grinding hard
Getting calling cards from your Barbie doll
When she 'round me, she know I'm her bodyguard
Money callin' for me, baby girl, I'm sorry
You just high yella, you not that important
Weight, shape her, I could pin you to the carpet
Smell like tartar, I'ma put you in the water
Conversation cost a lot of chips
She don't really get a lot of this
Engagin' where I'm gazin' at her hips
And ain't nobody makin' no attempts
Amazing clip, hanging, slanging dick
Maybe we can make it takin' trips
Maybe I was thinkin' too impatient
Phone ringing, hold up, what it is?
[Chorus]
I got two phones, one for the plug and one for the load
I got two phones, one for the bitches and one for the dough
Think I need two more, line bumpin’ I’m ring, ring, ringin’
Countin’ money while they ring, ring, ringin’

Diamonds really diamonds
And I'm shining bright ‘cause I'm really grindin'
They ask me if I'm real, I say, ""Is you serious?""
My daughter gon' love this bitch here

All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""
I look like I been ballin' ‘cause I'm really ballin'
I won't apologize, I'm not really sorry

I'm really out my mind, I say, ""Really really""
Really really

[Verse 1]
Make 'em believe, I made 'em believe
A lyrical song writer and he can sing
Bringing in money like raking in leaves
I was just trying to get paper to sneeze
Achoo, that was a blessing
She special to you, I don't look at her special
Actually, I treat her regular
Not being seen, we not making no spectacle
Gates had her first then he gave her to Kevin
All the above, we do all the et cetera
Scared of the feds, had to switch up my cellular
He talking reckless, don't call me back ever
Passing through Gardere to holler at Glover
Shout out to Black, shout out to Cedric
Grey Monte Carlo, cocaine 911
Just hollered at Trav, I'm like the Reverend
My section ridiculous, watch where you steppin'
Pockets on indigent, can't be too careful
Steve like 'em tall and when they yellow
Broke and in college, fresh with low mileage
I like 'em black, pretty white teeth
Body unique, booty on fleek
Jhené Aiko, chewing her cheeks
Groceries, please, you know that was me
[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""

[Verse 2]
Diving be treacherous (Swim)
Pray to God that don't nobody mess with us (Him)
Keep it strong in case anyone testing us
Right or wrong, if it's this, you don't mess with it
When yo' bitch over here I don't mess with her
No detective work, I don't be questioning
Where she been, trying to read all of her messages
I don't speak on no man, that's irregular
Take her phone, disconnectin' her cellular
What you need that for undressin' her?
What you need that for caressin' her?
Spreading her legs 'bout to pleasure her
Pulling her hair from the back, go to pressin' her
Trying to see who tap first, made a bet with her
Relationship flaking, no eczema
She catching feelings, she say we inseparable
Oyster Perpetual, it's not a replica
Mustang GT in the streets, smoking vegetables
Trunk in the front, do it make me a elephant?
I really really put syrup in my beverages
Shopping in Beverly, check out my etiquette
Loving my swag, women tailor keep checking it
Carats, they glisten in all of my necklaces
Feeling myself, really thought it was evident
[Hook]
All my diamonds shine ‘cause they really diamonds
Bad bitches in line, they be really trying
They ask me if I'm high, I say, ""Really really""
Got money on my mind, I say, ""Really really""

I wear my emotions on my sleeve you know what I'm saying
I've always been like that, my whole life, man
If I fuck with you, I'm all the way out there
If I don't fuck with you
I don't mind you knowing I don't fuck with you

[Verse  1]
Breaking down a key of coke, I ain't never seen a boat
Khaza got circumcised thinkin I'mma need a load
Boobie he a shooter hit the top of your medulla
From a scooter with a ruger I don't think he even need a scope
Attending college been a goal that I'm after
Evaded doin' life without parole wearin' shackles
I'm only fucking with what matters
A washed up rapper talking trash doesn't matter
Front windshield of the car went in shatters
My nigga brains blown out layin' in my lap
Told God take me, everybody blamed me
Praying till I'm prayed out won't bring him back

[Bridge]
They say my life is amazing
Funny been a question kinda wonder how I made it
Forest Gump and I got something in common
The world treat you different when brilliant
[Verse 2]
We ain't booted off a molly, we don't do shrooms
All we do is pass gas loud, excuse who?
Twin-turbo 911 make it vroom vroom
We in all black, my mechanic, make the tool move
Say you sip lean, yeah, I do too
I ain't tryna hit your cup, nigga, do you
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm reincarnated
I channel this spirit like Ali the greatest
Medicinal marijuana, am I medicated?
Aerosmith jaded
She looked like Nala when she got on top me
I gazed in her eyes and responded
Can we go half on a baby?
Broke another fingernail scratching up my back
Navel was to the ceiling when I'm pushing on her pelvis
See my tattoo of Elvis when I'm tearing up her cat
She tapped

[Hook]
I'm a perfect imperfection
My craft has been perfected
I just need affection
Emotionally, Imma introvert but it comes off as aggression
No one understand me and everybody can't be slow
It's refreshing to find someone who think like me so I can't be wrong
I'm a perfect imperfection and I don't find interest in the radio
So everytime I get high I watch the time pass by like away we go
Is it okay to cry when you're dying inside?
Seem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies
[Verse 3]
Point the flame at my brain with the full clip
Drake said Gates do his thing he don't bullshit
All you other niggas rap about is bullshit
Studio on drugs and you get all in your feelings
Look into your eyes nigga you ain't ever lived it
But always talking cooking dope nigga ever had heart ache
Ever lost money learning how to cook oil based
Ever grind hard tryna pay for your lawyer?
Get him paid off and you still go to jail
And that bitch that you love don't pick up when you call her
Fuckin' with your nigga when you get out and you dog her
Going with your mood with a nigga you don't argue
Came here to die in the game I'm retarded
Know its got a name I ain't knowing what to call it
Mama 3 way the call chopping game, me and 40
Freeman I look to you nigga and I love you
Know you lost your parents but with me you got a brother
Malaki and Chris Sprite all same trap
Cousin Lil Quick telling me he wanna rap
Uptown Beezy the white house administration
Get the paper had to see Tyrese in a scrap
When his seatbelt strap make it hard to lean back
Sittin' up straight in the car with the shades on
Young Seven with the jensen and my main man gone
I was doing time up in rivers when he came home
Now I'm waiting on a nigga for the get out of line
No drive by we jump out and dump where you grind
Excuse me I meant to say where you spend time
You too scared to hustle you just wasting time
I used to spend nights with Khalil and Jaquincy
And his brother fucked with the ones who against me
Stop making threats cause I swear I hate livin'
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me
Well shut up or kill me
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me
Bitch shut up or kill me

Yeah

[Hook]
Do you think I’ll ever need you, love, more than you need me?
Show me your true colors girl, I just want to see
'Cause I done had too many come around and change on me
She screamin' please don't waste my time
I say I totally agree
See girl I'm fine with that
I done gave my watches away, ain't got no time for that
Askin' where's my heart, good luck findin' that
How long could I see her round still think I'm timin' that
Think I'm still timin' that

[Verse 1]
Pretty teeth with a nice demeanor
I'm in a rush, it was nice to meet ya
Collared shirt, no elongated T's, cheaper to be yourself
Ain't no wrong way to be, accomplished a lot
I came from the block, ambitious in the trenches
I got a long way to reach
Sorry if I was offensive, but not at all
You got to pardon me at times, okay problem solved
When I hear the word can't take it like a challenge
I don't understand why the hell I can't have it
Help me understand why the hell I can't have it
I was blessed with a swag and I ain't braggin'
Insecurities get covered with designer fashion
If I'm not intimidatin' tell me why you're bashful
If you not feelin' what I'm sayin', sorry for the hassle
But if you leavin' here with me it'll be fantastic

[Verse 2]
Ain't no relaxin', they pillow fightin' on the sofa
Not at all my main focus though I was hopin'
Pull your hair, kiss it soft while you bendin' over
After that we could shower and I could hold ya
Havin' deep conversation and now you open
Pretendin' that I was asleep while you on the phone
Listen to you tell your girlfriend how I stroke it
Only that it was a foot I already know it, mind blowin'
Phone rang bout to go, is you rollin'
Playin' poker no cards, throwin' hands exposin'
Rest in peace Soulja Slim, slow motion
Kicked out of everywhere, expulsion

Full time father, full time artist
Asked God, he said ""Grind harder""
Learn from every time you ever fail
If it never fail just grind smarter
Iron sharpens, you the dagger
On they hindquarters and they all acting
Rap game, I'm a pallbearer
Kill me and get a call after
First look, it was all laughter
Kevin Gates, no small matter
Made men believe what they didn't believe
Dive in the crowd, no safety harness
Got in the booth, no safety on it
Aim and I shoot for the stars
At the awards I ain't win no awards
Only meaning one thing, don't get tired, I go hard

Me and the woman I love on an air mattress
We share a car, my hair nappy
Couldn't afford flights, no air travel
Stale Rice Krispies like sand and gravel
Our testament to what can happen
The moment you follow your heart
Keeping the faith even when it get dark
They say give up as I tell them ""Get lost""
Six weeks ago I just purchased a foreign
Most likely the one that you cannot afford
Right foot on the gas
Balenciaga be accelerating, I'm doing the dash
Chick that I'm with
Shorty be doing her shit and it's okay to say that she bad
Look to the right and I give her a glance
Pray to God we don't, pray to God we don't crash

To lose somebody you really love and they not dead
Suck it up and roll

Yeah, yeah
Love you with all my heart, I swear to God I do
So I forgive you, I'll never forget what you did

I'm not a human being
And I came up from nothin' just imagine that
Now I got my own, just imagine that
Tried to take it from me, I went and got it back
I lost day ones, just imagine that

Soon as they fall, they gon' call on me
I remember when they used to talk 'bout me
These days now I got it all, just imagine that

Like I remember when it wasn't nothin' with us
Now it's retarded
These days now I got it all
Choppin' game with the President, we on a call
Now we flyin' over Bogota
I swear that I'm flyer, it ain't no denial
I'm drownin', yeah, we goin' up
Got another female say she want it right now

Lot of bred Japanese red stitch denim jeans
I ain't scared of death, say you want it, yeah, we can squeeze
You ain't ready, yeah
When I'm alone in my trap, I would stare at the wall
Listenin' to Biggie Smalls, I can't wait 'til I ball
It's just me and my dawg, had a couple of flaws
I was bad at savin' money 'til a dick got a broad
I fell off, I got it
In Brooks town in the bed with her lookin' at the roof
I'm not opinionated, but I used to keep a tool
Never had too many problems 'til I had too many partners
Richard ever call a nigga back, he know I got him
I put that on my body

Open up to tell me why you frownin' up, time flies fast
Thumbin' through the bands, countin' up
I no longer post on Carolina, had to switch the route
Turn the beat up, I ain't all beat in the drought

Let me at them
Say you love me (Say you love me)
I know I'm not the only one
Go Grizz (Know I'm not the only one)
Struggles that I'm overcoming
I killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
W-W-W-W-Winners Circle

[Chorus]
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one
Struggles I done overcome
I killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one

[Verse 1]
Lay me for a brick layer slangin' weight
Fell in love, made a new mistake
Baby momma arguin', askin' where was I
Instead I ask her ""How we do today?""
Breakin' through the safety pin with solid ye
I most likely blew through 28
Women shady, how come I ain't choose to hate?
Loyal to 'em how come I ain't see the play?
Couldn't see no wrong in people tryna help 'em
Wanna see my youngin's really eatin'
Goaltending, blocking blessings for no reason
One bedroom apartment watchin' killer season
Had my share, funny tell you while it's secret
People that you love and they not sharin' nothin'
See you pockets ugly, won't reach out for nothin'
I can't wait to catch you bitches out in public
Buyin' out the mall, fuck your bitch in front you
Okay too aggressive, other women love it
I don't kiss and tell, lot of artists wonder
Cut the bra, and punch it longer in her stomach
Rough and rugged, took some losses, money doubled
Toilet bowl, thinking shittin' on 'em, fuck it
Playin' chess and the bishop on the muscle
You would never love me like my daughter love me
[Chorus]
I can't be the one you love
And I can't be the one you love
Struggles I overcome
Killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 2]
Actors got stripes they ain't never earned
Not a freak for fame, rather wait my turn
Say he taddle-tailing put him in the dirt
Fuck his family members, they can wear his shirt
Every rapper talkin' cookin' dope
Flippity flip, break-break your wrist
I desire now to be alone, no attention if it's ignorance
To say it frankly, I don't give a shit
Breathin' hard, come on say what's in your thoughts
Somethin' on your mind, I could take it off
Money mean nothin', I want my respect
Death before dishonor tatted on my flesh
Holes in my clothes, underarms smellin'
Million man march this ain't Malcolm X
Welfare, receivin' government assistance
Get up out the bed, spend up all they check
How you don't know that, you ain't never yeah
What you mean by ye, talkin' sellin' crack
Embalming fluid runs through Montana
Thinking going back and peddle weight
Pills that Reedy stuck stopping up the Brig
Renegade hoes settin' up the trench
Junkies usin' H, it's a better feel
[Chorus]
I can't be the one you love
And I can't be the one you love
Struggles I overcome
Killed that nigga for my dog and now he owe me one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
Say you love me, yeah
I know that I'm not the only one

[Verse 3]
Ain't been havin' no dreams
Don't be gettin' no sleep
How can someone call me those things
They don't even know me
I lost everything I love a week ago
Loyalty which probably mean the most
Heart played on every time I gave
Makin' me afraid of being close
Big dog, mouth full of gold
Big loud, ounce getting rolled
We dive out 20 shows
Radio stop playin' songs
I ain't really feel like I was wrong
Southside finest get it on
Right back grindin', teeth grittin'
Ship sinkin', cry about it? No
Catch 'em with the lyrics on a whim
The one who spoke the laws I am him
Started out, we wanted us some ends
Late night discussion of a Benz
Late night we fussin' bout the rent
Eviction notice posted, I ain't notice
Focused tryna get another flip
Wasn't makin' half of what I spent
Tee Newman passenger, we lit
I just got with Mocha that's a lick
Conversation with the boss man, look
We was talkin' signin' him again
Women wanna clown in front they friends
Like you was not respectin' what it is
Listen when I tell you what it is
To be around you signin' a consent
You know I just got married to your friend
I done threw a ring around the dick
Diamonds dancin' every time I spit
Had to throw some bling up on a bitch
Self made stand up guy
God first, hands to the sky
All I do is ride nigga, yeah
I don't even argue about the bread
That lil' money that you owe me, you can have
I can't even see me gettin' mad
I can't even see me goin' backwards
Know you wanna see me on my ass
Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass
Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?
I just rolled a stick of Mad Hatter
Please me let me enjoy the ride back
Please me let me enjoy the ride back
Could you please me let me enjoy the ride back?
I just rolled a stick with mad air
Cuttin' up with Dreka fine ass
Swagger matchin', where'd you find that?
[Outro]
See I live my life like you know I'm gonna enjoy this bitch 'cause you never know when this gon' be over. I can't be the one you love12Embed"

Kevin Gates, I'm everybody sworn favorite
People tend to feel I'm Michael Jackson reincarnated
Satellites, never really made love
Alright

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, but she gon' get it right
Emotions probably telling her she could stay the night
But her friends all call us crazy, they don't give her good advice
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, Gates
Never really made love
Say she never really made love

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I've been shot through the heart
Just on the d-low, Luca Brasi selling kilos
Gotta shop outta town and got a spot just around the way
Let's be specific, if I'm the nigga you feeling
Am I wrong for showing interest in these women surrounding
I'ma straight dick her down and go
No time to lounge with hoes
On the grind, all the time
I done been down this road
Strictly need my C-notes, can you keep up with my lingo?
Some'll say life is a gamble, which means love is a casino
Everybody just playin' to win, think I made it again
Though many ladies pretend, hoping this ain't what it is
This business I'm in, may make me taking a bid
Would you still be my friend, when I'm lonely, love?
Get 'em gone, cause ain't no one on the phone, but us
Someone who strong when it's rough, someone who won't give up
Ain't no wasting time, hustle every night
Promise everything is alright
[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love but she gone get it right
Emotions probably telling her, she could stay the night
But her friends all call us crazy, they don't give her good advice
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, Gates
Never really made love, oh
Say she never really made love, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
People changing on me, I am so sick of the masquerades
Grew up poor, had no dishes, ate off paper plates
I'm taking aim, brought up in this life I know
Baby, you a rider and I love when you ride it slow
Motion for me, girl
Arch up to the ceiling, now bend over for me, girl
Pulling on your hair, while I'm gripping on your ass
When I kill it from the back, know you feel it in your back
Late night screaming, all of the right reasons
Touching, teasing, blowing it might please
Make it bite back, I love when it bite me
Saying take some out, I know what it might be
When your body go to shaking, you're raising your right knee
Bit the pillow with your teeth, I know what it might mean
I'ma keep going, I know that the light green
Can't stay still, I'm stroking the right thing
Climb in the bed, with a dime in the bed
Don't tell me the spot, I'ma find it instead
Big, fine muthafucka, she a dime with the head
Just got a text, never mind what it said
​iPhone ringing, I decline with a fret
Which color should I press, lime or the red
Decline or accept, next line never read
Minus the time and the time been the best
Told her what it was first time that we met
But she cry and get upset every time that I left
[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love but she gone get it right

But her friends all call us crazy, they don't give her good advice

Go in there and give 'em the business, flush him out
And we gon' turn up in this bitch tonight, hard for
Luca Brasi nigga

[Hook]
It's a few wrong ways and they don't make a right
You can do both ways, ignorin' wrong and the right
New boyfriend whom she don't seem to like
Stay right here, it's him your won't see tonight
Argumentative but say she want compromise
Women say they love but never more than the ice
Mistakin' it for trust, starin' right in the eyes
Women say they love but never more than the ice
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I'm confused, what the fuck you want my heart for?
You the only one that my dick could get hard for
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

Can you even hear me?
I've been misused, what the fuck you want my heart for?

[Interlude]
Girl, but Kevin it's like you here but you ain't here though
Gates, what the fuck you mean I'm not here? I'm right here
Girl, you lookin' at me like you want another bitch to jump at my face
Gates, well maybe I do
[Verse 1]
Talkin' work on my phone nigga say he got them bricks
Scored a few by the two, or the ten, that's a lick
And my momma know I'm gutter and she also know I'm strapped
And she know I killed the key and Keith, ain't try to murder back
She know you take a shot at me, I'ma send like 30 back
Christina and Alicia, they both keep my dirty gat
Comprehend you talkin' reckless while we on my cellular
Life is too depressin' to be stressin' on the regular

I wanna stop hustlin', I wanna change over
Right now a nigga aim on that Range Rover
God forgive for the brains I done blowed away
Put that on my unborn child and my throwaway
Commitment shy, I'm afraid of bein' involved
Shawty tell me she love me, I don't tell her I love her back
Niggas in the hood, I go see 'em when I can
I got niggas in jail, I go and see 'em in the can

Yeah
It ain't nothin' to fuck yo bitch dog

Starin' at me like the damsel in distress
Acapulco diamonds and they dancin' on my neck
Flawless no inclusions we don't fuck with VVS
Fall off in the club and its cardiac arrest
Her cardiac arrest
Maliyah dancin' to my song
I'm a plug who make music I'm like Tego Calderon
Still I'm bout that gangsta' shit so please don't rub me wrong
I need to see you naked with no clothes when I get home
Slighty narcissistic bae so please don't read me wrong
Dickmatized her, dick amazing, and she blowing up my phone (won't leave me alone)
Bitch I'mma killer
Up in her cervix she screaming its murder, her face in the pillow
Pulling her hair, while I nibble her ear, and I’m fucking her slow and we all in the mirror
Hold up, Oh well
Left the ho at the hotel
Bungee jumping, my line chirping, bout' to go and catch me a sale
(Bae don't leave) You trippin', you can stay here or come with me
Whipped up at the gas station bought a box of Goodies and a digit
Need sixty dollars on pump four cause the gas tank like empty
Won't play the game like 2 Chainz, ain’t riding around but I'm gettin' it
Pull up at the trap, I'mma text ya phone like ""I'm over here come get it""
Buggati, fucking with Brittany
Told her ""I'm sorry"" she say she forgive me
Entangled in my conversation as if I'm a Judas she look at me different
Would we get in trouble for fucking each other cause I use to fuck with your sister
I heard that your pussy get wet as a river and possibly need some assistance

Oooooooohhh it ain't nothin' to fuck yo' bitch dog

[Verse 2]
Retawdid', reading my aura, I'm too intelligent that why you bothered
Know it’s a name but don't know what to call it
My name is Kevin but she call me awesome
South by Southwest was performing in Austin
Ignored the BS and I ain't bout no talkin'
Can’t see you niggas, my clip in the carbine
Don't make me spray this bitch like Madd Marvin
(Bitch what you ain’t hear me?) Bitch don’t make me spray this bitch like Mad Marvin
Hold up, I say I don't get tired!
Blessing in disguise, this for those no longer with us while we out here on the grind
May God be with your families while you rest up in the skies
Shout out Roy and Ryan nigga’ dipping through that nine
I'm loving on Lil NaNa I met her at a Second Line
Bread Winners Association, still I'm out my mind
Drika booty bigger than a bitch I grip her from behind
And can we have a threesome I know that she don't mind
Know it's warmer than a sauna stroke her for a long time
Bae told the bitch to get here
Then she got off in the bitch ear
Got to feelin’ on her, never been molested came out her clothes then we rip
We a power couple don't trip
We a power couple that trick
Bread Winner escort service we'll buy bitch a new whip
Broke hoes car break down can't afford to get the bitch fixed
Fake bags in a air mattress can't afford to get the shit fixed

Thought I was sleep when you went in my pocket

Pull your hairs, smack your ass, knock your break shoes loose
Other lames take you out shoppin', dinner, and a movie
Suck your titty in the mirror with a finger in your booty

Say it make your pussy moist every time the engine revvin'

Think about you all the time, start to feel it backfire

Tryna figure out why, dyin' on the inside
One day I'll get over my pride

[Verse 1]
I knew I loved you when I met you, some say this don't exist
Emotions captured, had to have you, ain't care who you was with
At your apartment off of Siegen, had a brief disagreement
You move back to Houston, we went like three years without speakin'
I got back on drugs bad while I was stillin' chasin' cheddar
My heart was broke, soft and stressin' battlin' with my depression
On top of that my team was shittin' on me harder than ever
Not a worry in the world whenever we was together
I flew you out to Miami, we laid up in the suites
Bathtub full of fruits while I was rubbin' your feet
We went to Bloomingdales, I bought us matchin' grey theory sweats
Said I ain't want you to leave before you boarded the jet

He cool with you because of you I now treat him like a stranger

Best of what life has to offer love, you still my little sister
Pull up in vets, hear the engines, eight speed tiptronic transmission
Four door Porsche reminicisin'
Wishin' that you was here with me
I used to to tease you bout your feet
We would laugh and we'd giggle
And havin' breakfast on the beach
You don't know how much that meant to me
Holdin hands in Aventura Mall ,public affection

Over there seeking a handout I'm not finna hand it, godamnit

Too much respect for to call you a bitch
All praise go to heaven your god don't exist
Love everything and everybody
Black sheeps scum of the earth
With popular people I don't fit
They was stupid they focus on bullshit
Now the whips they be driving is bullshit
Yo pastor lie to you right from the pulpit
Go hard or starve
No wait on God
Give him your money? That's bullshit
Full clips and a firearm
Put it in a ho name so I buy it for em
Pockets was slim as a diet form
Good dope sell itself wanna try it for em?
Smoke out hotel rooms and set off the fire alarm
BWA start a riot for em

Seem like everybody ungrateful
When they ever brought food to my table?
Unappreciative it don't phase me
See envy all in they faces
You ain't help or write a rap or do a day in jail
I ain't see yo name on no paper
Hard on hoes I been scarred
Betrayal left a hole in my heart
Blood sweat and tears went into this
How you think you deserve part?
Child support court or get fought
All the best lawyers get bought
Let that other nigga take care of that
You be on his dick like his shit raw
Lied to you in his friend car
Sold you a dream and you got caught
These hoes want rap niggas or a athlete that play ball
Sip coffee peep it don't talk
Handle shit horribly we fall off
I was just tryna be a real friend to you now I'm wishing that we get lost
We was only fifteen at ya momma house

Glock in my back pocket, already cocked okay I'm clockin' cheese
Strap jump off the hinges in the trenches, all in alleyways
Had to say, each and every day we grabbin' paper
Live the hustle, probably die, gangster and etcetera
Sometime I can't take no break, they keep callin' my cellular
This the game and we know this life we gon' be alright
Ain't no sleep tonight, bitch we out here chasing paper

At the Paul Inn with the Tech 9, no bandana, no gloves on
Long kiss, goodnight my nigga, but we ain't makin' no love song
This bullshit you sold me got Inisotol no soda on it
I straight dropped and lost 20 grams like what the fuck is you smokin' homie
Red Camaro, white rally stripes, gon' probably be on TV
Move wrong while the tool on, I'll put your ass on Street Beat
Repeat, you see me, I'm a repeat offender
Park the whip, lay under houses, hear you moving round with the stethoscope
Arrested for a little vestiges to teach these pussy niggas 'bout stretchin' coke
Bend the bend with the machine gun, like, ""Say hello to my little friend""

Say it's about to get interesting, bitch say she from Michigan

Imagine how the fuck we feel, in the winter time no heat here
I sleep here, all my smokers beg, bum, and borrow for free beer
And we feel, you need a nigga like me in your life
Grind time it's goin' vrroommm
I listen to the radio, we all fly, shawty say she all mine
Color all in the wrong lines, to the dope game I got strong ties
I've sold cocaine, this all the time
Favorite old song, entitled ""White Lines""
Watch rich people snort white lines, with white wine at dinner parties

24 hours, nigga, seven days a week (A week)
Gee, I don't get tired
I let you other niggas sleep (Sleep)
Turn up for that check
And yeah I get it out the streets (Streets)
Hustle like I'm starving
Going hard, I gotta eat (Woo)

[Chorus]
I get it out the mud (Yeah, yeah)
I get it out the mud (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Watch how I break my wrist (Ice)
Make that water whip
Stretch it out, then flip (Ooh)

Watch how I break my wrist
Make that water whip
Stretch it out, then flip

[Verse 1]
Turn up in two seconds (Countdown)
Get it with music and coke, what I'm stretching (Wow)
Across the street under a bando
And here with your ho, could get her to go fetch it (Here boy)
On the scale, but I call it the ruler
And that's what I'm using my method of measure (Streets)
Got it jumping up out of the pot and
My clique-ity clucking surrounding my property (Boom)
I meant to say my clientickity (For real?)
Numbers official retickity
Out the mud, nobody did shit for me
Arrogant often I'm bigity (Shit)
All about money, like what done got into me
Breaking down bricks and we blowing good grigity
Say you ain't feeling me, oughta try killing me
Neighborhood love me, it's hard to get rid of me (Brr)
My baby mothers are sick of me
I put that dick on 'em
Now they ridiculously saying, that when I don't come in I'm with a freak bitch
I've been chasing my paper religiously (Ooh)
I'm really in the street, others pretend to be
Let me get off of my grind then it's silly me
No one'll pity me, coming and getting me out the mud
Nigga, I'm the epitome

Money coming, money gotta flip it
I ain't waiting on nobody, I'ma go get it (Go get git)
I ain't tripping on a nigga, I'm a gorilla (Ooh)
Somebody take something from me, I'm gonna go kill 'em (Rrr)
Trap booming hard and I'm serving out the window
Burglar barred up, with a curtain on the window
Face card worth a lot of bands in the hood
Had to leave the dice game, gotta bond-out [?] (Turn up)
Sunday coming up, pull the cars out, look
Another 20 grand, told my girl call Nook (What)
Post bail, what the hell got all y'all shook (Hello)
Poo hit the line in the drop
Plug went dry, had to take another route (C'mon)
Pulling up, getting it
I done went sickening
Drop no whip, and a nigga gon' vouch (Gon' vouch)
Another 4K just stuffed in the couch
Promise I ain't tryna swag, I just got a lot of that
Anybody try me, I'ma put 'em in a body bag (Zip)
Follow that, copy that
Pounds in the garbage bag
Backed in the bank, y'all leaving after dropping that (Yeah)
Call 'em back, call 'em back
Juug, no falling back (Peep)
Quicker than I got it (Peep), then I done ran out of that (Peep)
My Denim Springs people (Peep), little partner outta Walker (Peep)
Shitting harder than a bitch, they gon' probably want all of that

She let her heart get the best of her
Butter, she spread, dope what I do to her legs
Like the cocaine, I be stretchin' 'em
I've been hurtin', you wouldn't know the half
I'm a snake and she ain't mow the grass
Guard's down, now I'm on her ass
Credit card I'm maxin' out again
Drop top vert, do the dash

My lil' brother, yeah she let him smash
Ain't too many we ain't really had
Stack it to the ceilin', do what you 'posed to do
Watch everybody that you keepin' close to you
Fuck over you bad and won't nobody notice
My heart kept the razor, ain't nothin' disposable
Gave it my all, went to war, I've been scarred
Dealt with a broad and she played with my heart
Played on by friends, not protectin' my cards

Came from the bottom, we aim for the stars
Won't shoot in the air, that's like playin' with God

Close homies just as a reminder
You can smoke, just don't let it blind you
These scriptures what I'm tellin Khaza
Don't let nobody know that you a monster
Keep it on the tuck and then surprise 'em
Mouth shut, let 'em think you're quiet
Big steps, always movin' silent
Strong shit, a legend when you sign it
Wishy washy shit you don't acknowledge
Pillow talk, pussy shit in private
Them hoes only know what you allow
Stand on all ten like you're a tower
One deep, you are not a coward
Never rat, if you do, you sour
Respect level, keep it at a dollar
Not involved in other people's problems

Diamond teeth when I bless the game, I was bein' quiet but got a lot to say
Unique chains on a freeway, don't need reigns, cocaine Wraith
Made a statement, I was grindin' on 'em, got an order off, want a replay?

Making Salat, I ain't miss a beat
Praise to Allah, made it out the clink
Alhamdulillah, praise be to God
Big booty freak, givin' a massage
Lookin' in the mirror, lookin' at a star
She get on her knees and look up at a star
Remember being broke, wishin' on a star
Out the mud, no one givin' us a start
White gold, iced out, Audemars
Foreign car, push button, autostart
Rest and relaxation not involved, goin' hard Rolls Royce, R&R
Wonder why these niggas hate me?
Probably 'cause they know they ain't me
I ain't never been a gang member, Illinois labeled me a gang chief
Political spear, Judge Linehan racist, I’m bein' sentenced
Wrongful conviction, broke bread and lied to me
Gave him a quarter ticket, he did not appeal it
Layin' in my cell, lookin' at the ceiling
I'm on a division, me and all the killers
Throwin' shit and piss on all the staff members
Even got the warden, that’s why they had to ship us

I'm rockin' Bread Winners' fitness apparel
Sexy receptionist look like a dancer
Pardon me ma'am, I'm demandin' some answers
Not makin' plans that was made to be cancelled
Coulda said, ""Hi,"" you know I'm kinda bashful
Unwillin' to fuck with me, why is you starin'?
Got some real niggas and we into sharin'
Conservative aura, I glow in the dark
I speak in no English, I'm talkin' numerics
Islamic fashion out in Paris, overseas when I travel, McLaren
Come to think this was me in the alley
Mickie D's we was purchasin' salads
Chi-raq, buyin' chicken from Harold's
Jerk Villa curry chicken and cabbage
Fresh yams, politic'n with family
I got status, gotta catch me in traffic
Makin' music, but I'm really a trapper
Booty club, 'bout to fuck up a sandwich
A hundred bands, if you ain't catch him, what's happenin'?

Amsterdam on the tram, we in transit
Word to God, I'ma fuck a Kardashian

How the fuck is you, why the fuck is you falling all in yo feelings?
No understanding I'm ignorant
You gonna probably say that I'm tripping
Throw the left hand, you duck that one
This right bitch won't miss you
Beat a bitch like Chris Brown, go back to jail, no question
No surrender, no retreat, park the whip, hop out on feet
Me and her brother juuged together
He bet not get in my business

How I'm rockin', you gon' pop me or it's back to penitentiary

Hop up out the shower, you got louder, I bow bow you
Ripped the gown you, had around you
Threw you down, and smelled yo flounder
If he jizz that, dick you down, I would've toilet water drowned

Pin you down so you can't run, in and out game
Hit you from the back, probably get you with the mouth game

Spit all in between both cheeks, now I spread 'em

No draws underneath with the slits in the side

If she squint back, hmm, bet I'm approachin'
Playin' my song, slow dancin' to ""Strokin'""
Track number seven, told me it was her (Jam)
Leave your keys with your friends, oh, you rolled with your friends?
Start the car and I get in, we rollin'
Lit the leaf, hit the green, we smokin'
Slow motion, coupe just floatin'
Kissin' on her finger with my hand on her breast

In Alexandria, it’s nothing for to get it gone
With music, I ain’t won awards, but I kept it gangster
Gon' be a god in New Orleans like that nigga Daymond
Landlord in the south like my nigga Lucci
Corvette in front of David Ways screeching free Lee Lucas
Fuck that nigga bitch, I got her saying free Lee Lucas

But me and Gunna in the Porsche truck and we screeching off like lightning
Fast, doing the dash, your bitch on my ass, she want me to smash
Flip out and flash, I’d rather get cash
Dreka she bad and she into bags
Up in the Louis, Emilio Pucci
I tell 'em it's Gucci when they want them bands
I got them racks and no longer wear jewelry
'Cause I'm bout my business, and back selling sand
I don’t get tired
I'm 'bout my business, and back selling sand
I'm 'bout my business, and back selling sand
(I'm 'bout my business, and back selling sand
I'm 'bout my business, and back selling sand)
[Chorus]
Bet a lot of pussy niggas wanna murder Brasi
Boulevard, Mar-a-Lago and a Maserati
Boobie Black, Gunna, and Menace still will catch a body
And if you fuck around with Rayzor, bitch I'm out my body
Sideways, skrrt, coupe be out my body
Whole clique pull up in 'Vettes, bitch we out our body
And you ever disrespect it, then it's kamikaze
I just be with me a shooter like I'm John Gotti
I feel like John Gotti, John Gotti
'Cause it ain’t shit to send a hit, I feel like John Gotti
It ain’t shit to send a hit, I feel like John Gotti41Embed"

I don't get tired...

[Verse 1]
Broke another ten for the Bread Winner Brick Gang
Popping up pregnant, silly bitch tryna trick Gates
Start selling pussy, maybe that'll get your rent paid
Come to think about it, don't you live with your mama?
I don't give a shit when I ride 'round the bottom
Cocaine vet, paddle shifting on Highland
Boosie had a black Monte Carlo and a 'Burban
I was in a grey Monte Carlo and a Tahoe
He was doing shows, bad hoes up in Tahoe
I was speaking Spanish with the plug havin' convos
Big hair ran lips, hit the line every morning cause they know I keep the lean by the carload
In the top, hit the boulevard solo
Big Right know I got soft for the low-low
In a drought, me and Nuk, only ones had dope
Nigga blew my leg off for a nine-piece
Tried to grab the gun, couldn't get it, middle of the night
Had to fight for my life when you try me
Connecting in Sherwood,Mark my nigga
I love my nigga, I owe you one nigga
Brookstown Richard, that's my little brother
Everytime I think about him, gotta tell him that I love him
Praying to the Lord that Car came from under that charge
Free my nigga Head when I bow my head
[Hook]
Late night, when alone, can't sleep
I got too many problems
The weight of the world on my shoulders
Pray that heaven do something about it
The chick that I'm lovin'
Wondering who is she fuckin'
The friends I got 'round me
Wonder which one of them sour
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, bitch I'm pourin' the
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup
Bitch I'm pourin' the syrup
Bitch I'm pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup
Bitch I'm pourin' the syrup

[Verse 2]
I was naive, thinking that I couldn't get hurt
Thought she was faithful, fuck her but my dick burnt
Everybody laughed when I kissed her
I can't even lie, to this day still I miss her
We was on Scottsdale Inn by Jags
Used to go to sleep in the pussy on an air mat
André Harris talked bad behind my back
Even though it hurted, I ain't tripping, never mind that
Me and Darrell Harris in a stolen car thugging
You get out of line, he goin' put you in a puddle
Me and Brittney Harris in the side room cuddlin'
Eat the pussy while she on the rag, like ""Yummy""
My daddy nephew, kinda make him my cousin
We was having lunch at Chimes when you told me that you love me
I ain't never back down from a fight in my life
Big guy slapped you, you went and got your cousin
Nigga shot and missed, and I came back dumping
I was 13 when I put one under
Ask my mama, go ask my brother
Go on South 12th, and go ask Big London (shoutout)
Jamison and Gary and Will know the truth
I was selling crack with the cameras on the roof
You was never that, at the plant working turnarounds (turnarounds?)
Little Steve hittin' your bitch from the back, matter fact
That's a fact, when I seen it, had to turn around
E-Dub, Dope Boy, Lil E, Big Mook
Me and Foots in my truck with the burners out
When you was on 3rd St., and ain't wanna squeeze
Pillow talking with your bitch, tryna play me like I'm weak
Now I'm coming at your girl, top nigga, no problem
You will never find out another thing about it
Come to think about it, got a coffee shop in Denver, Colorado
I'mma catch her when she visiting her mama
Ri-Ri, fine, your old man hate me?
Can't rap like Gates, fucking up lately?
Me, you, and Dreka oughta take a vacation
We can have a threesome after waking up in Vegas
Give you 50k, fail to mention what it came with
Eat, pray, making love, see the world baby
Breadwinners swim where I'm fucking with a gangsta
You can model for my line, I can make you famous
Running from my tongue when I lick all in your anus
Intelligent the way I talk, vagina I contained it
Ever been ate, two mouths at the same time?
Ever had lips on your booty and your pussy
Got your body feeling mushy
When your water go to gushing
Brazillian wax, I don't like playing in the bushes
Pull your hair, smack it, bend back, get a whoopin'
[Chorus]
The chick that I'm lovin'
Wondering who is she fuckin'
The friends I got 'round me
Wonder which one of them sour
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup
Pourin' the syrup, pourin' the syrup, bitch I'm pourin' the

Yo me llamo Luca Brasi
Ughh
Yo mato por nada
Yo tengo muchas pistolas, cabron
Yo tengo cocaina, marijuana, y lo que tu necessita
Numeros bueno
If you having trouble translating what the fuck I just said, go get Rosetta Stone
Puta, pendejo

[Verse 1]
Passionate about crack sales, people wonder if I have a cracked head
See OG and freelow, don't ever call em no crack head
Brap brap, cracked legs, broke ribs, cracked head
Meat cleaver to the white meat, cracked eggs
Pots, pans, still objects, non-stick, district court
Nonsense child support, tryna settle things outta court
Luca brasi a mobster, choke your throat in your collarbone
Broken nose and a collarbone, neck look like a xylophone
Sick of being bothered, pussy artist you can’t buy a sound
When I was broke I was a joke, I couldn't buy a phone
Wrong number, call a bitch, I get the dial tone
Now my dick been gaining weight from getting smiled on
Cheeks, cheeks, or should I say no teeth?
Been off the streets for 14 months and I ain't miss a beat
White girl wasted, a couple want me to cuddle
Need them bills to pay her bill, she love my lil' brother Chuckie
Booty club transaction in traffic saying they love it
OG car moving blocks boxing impuddle
Down set hut, out the huddle I suffer concussions
Wide receiver, pass protection, no fumble, touchdown, or nothing, go
[Chorus]
Bitch I run the streets, don't talk to police
Say what's my name? Perdoname, no habla ingles

[Verse 2: Percy Keith]
I know I'm the shit like my shit don't have a stench
And all my hoes are ratchet like I don't have a wrench
And all my hoes are in the game like I don't have a bench
And they gimme so much brain, them hoes don't make no sense
And my white girl in the kitchen work her wrist like Rachel Ray
I don't see no black and white, I see 50 shades of grey, yeah
Cocaine and jail, bars story of my life
I got 11 in the car, I hope amigo wrapped 'em right
I don't want these nigga's bitches so I'mma give 'em back to 'em
But they mouth game exclusive, I'm startin' to get attatched to 'em
Bitches on my dick, I got to ask 'em where my dick is
Shout out to my girlfriend too, sup girl? I’m good, don’t worry
Benz truck, I'm loving it, I love it so much I fuck in it
Am I tripping or is her pussy talkin', I swear it just told me to nut in it
Her pussy so tight I'm stuck in it, feel like she still sucking it
I beat it until it young bleed like her, nigga what in it

[Verse 3]
Bitch I'm fresh up off my grind like a skateboard in this prime
Don't skateboard why lie, couldn't skateboard if I tried
I like trap houses and kitchens and love to fuck with prescriptions
Got a bad bitch and she sickening, you'd prolly guess she a stripper
She kinda tall, got a long weave, her thighs thick and she slender
She play mean but she really sweet, got pretty teeth and she tender
My mother's Puerto Rican with pistols, illegal tender
I ain't pussy like the son of the one on illegal tender
Gason Donald bitch you play Willy Cooley I get you injured
Went to school, too busy focused on pigeons, we got suspended
Boyfriend ugly, girl I'm too cute to be going duffy
Keep that hifey shit from around me in public, could lead to scufflin'
Free zoah li jamalo while in the Roco republic
Still I thrive in the gutter, missing lives in the jungle
Pair of cleates dirty feet had to improvise when I'm probably
Boobly bumpy on a muscle, can't go aside from the hustle, no

Put the soda on it, see what it do
Yeah, all night, all night
A hunnid of 'em, just sold it all (Take it, cook it soft)
Drop all on it pouring all all and all ayy
Whatever tell nigga to bring me my pink phone, ya heard me?
A hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

[Chorus]
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all
Surrounded by the angels, diamonds on when I'm talkin' love
She wanna be my lil' baby, but I'm afraid to fall in love
She say, ""I only get excited when the pack touch down""
Pray that we don't don't get indicted in the trap uptown
Bitch, I'm a big gangsta, I turn her out with that foreign love
Cocaina slanga, a hunnid of 'em, just sold it all

[Verse 1]
Hold up
Gimme that money, lil' nigga, you knowin' that I'ma do right with it
Private charter, they snortin' that tartar, I got 'em surrounded by white women
I got 'em looking like Paris Hilton
Each one of my teeth got a carat in it (Bling)
Ayy, I think my plug racist (Why is that?)
All he send is white (Let's go)
They going dumb in the slum where I'm from
Got a drum on a gun like a pair titties
They say that I'm makin' a major mistake for deliverin' weight but I barely listen
I got a play that I'm 'bout to go make for like 200K in a matter of minutes
I can remember the day when the shit was a shame and I didn't even have a penny
Brand new apartment and we couldn't afford no new furniture, put us a mattress in it
Went broke in the mall, I was tryna keep up with a image and still had to stack and get it
My daughter turned one on a Sunday, next mornin' on Monday, I had to go back to prison
My woman was pregnant with Khaza, I put it in throttle and got a new pack delivered
My sister was cryin', she want a new body
I went and got her some ass delivered
Grind independently, showin' no sympathy
Don't let the industry gas a nigga
Went bought me some diamonds, I did it for Mazi
But I never really been flashy with it
Kickin' myself in the ass, I went and tatted the face of a snake on the back of my kidney
[Bridge]
Shit, I give any man a chance ya heard me
But once you show me a flaw, that fall back game in full effect
Look, you can leave your gun in the car, dick
Luca Brasi, I'ma speak for him

These nigga showing me anger, they takin' it out on me
Hit the booth after I hang up with Maceió Hazis
I really fuck with dude, for real
Disruptive behavior eluded me
Was truly been given a taste, considered this taste for knowin' what foolish is
O.C. on the road when the coca was slow
But I still was on go, I was movin' pills
Money discussion, ain't asking a nigga for nothin'
You look like a fool, for real
Thumbin' through hunnids, attemptin' to limit consumption of drinkin', I'm through with this
Caught me a head in a few attempts
Coppin' the gat with a coolin' kit
Depressin' as hell when you step on a scale
God damn, I got fat, I done grew some tits
Supposed to be a Muslim but they started judgin' me, laser removing the crucifix
I hit Rodeo I'm not on the payroll, I shot to Laredo to do it big
Shout out to players who movin' bricks
Breakin' the package down, boomin' knicks
I throw you a four-way, two for six
Stand on the jacket, I'm too legit
I stand in the kitchen and do the foo'
Weigh on the digi one, two to six, scrapin' the dish
She get her a push on a pipe and say Superman do exist
Movin' the wrist that's movie shit
Ain't moving like them, that's goofy shit
Caught me a blessin' 'cause I'm a perfectionist, shawty petite and her booty big
Tell 'em it's wonder this shit turnin' peoples into zombies and I don't approve of this
I got what you want, I deliver the fungus up under the trunk of the Honda Civic
My partner denied me, this bitch tried to bite me, he didn't want me to fuck her with 'em

As a wise man that think if I possess the game in my mind
The reason I wear shades you can't see the pain in my eyes

In the rain storm in the blizzard, expressing all of my feelings
Pause, never took me serious, naw, mama never wanna listen
Stomach hurting my pockets empty how dare a nigga wanna tempt me
In the dark room all prayed out, I ain't never sat in no Bentley
Hustle hard in the alley way by Ms. Cita house I'm getting it
Wrecked my car Chris laughed at me, like I ain't supposed to remember
Wish Wig was still living, wish Shrimp was still living
Wish Joe was still living
Look at Chris how he tripping
Young Troll just hit the phone
But he don't keep it a thousand
Ray Vicks just jacked him, and he ain't even see bout that
Now he telling me 'bout that
Seem to me he ain't 'bout that, nigga let me get a thrill juice
You don't have it now, but you gone have it later
My face card worth a hundred bands
Game recognize game baby, my lil brother lil Terrance Hines
I'd die for him and go to war behind him
Real niggas, all around me, bitch niggas ain't round me
Talkin Massachusetts exclusive, somebody bring it back
Cocaine made me smile but I cried
Ain't think my team a rat
Stroke know I love em
But nigga around could say fuck me
How that go when I fuck with nigga, ain't nobody gone fuck with em
In the neighborhood that I grew up in
They call it the southside, everybody house overcrowded
Forcing them to hang outside, my lil cousin Corey, hustle hard in fruits town
On the boulevard with the roof open like damn fed what I do now
Me and Bees and Rodney, ice cup and it's muddy
You don't like me then fuck you
Probably dap me off and say fuck me
God forgive me next nigga play with me
I'll probably kill they mother
Make the funeral you in trouble
A lot of guns out and they bustin'
Pussy rapper talking shit on Twitter
But out in public it's nothing
Discussion had and I bump em
If looks could kill, I would've been dead
Bitch I'm with give real head
But I don't trust her that much
Let me slip and go back to jail
Watch how many niggas she fuck
Let me slip and go back to jail
Watch how many niggas she fuck

Most likely I'm too intelligent
They say cuts heal, not much here
You forget about it or you get around it
Can't forget about it, then you kill about it
I'm a ordained street minister
Read the bible, but a finish ya
Still have trouble with letting go
That ain't my ho, I just thought it was
My friends laughed when I kissed on her
Shoulda pulled my dick out and pissed on em
My family on fire wouldn't piss on em
Cold world, don't quit on me
Grind hard, get rich on em
Whatever you do just stack paper
My lil cousin Chief just called my phone, and I'm like what's the problem
""Heard about Lil Mocha? Nigga tried him and Lil Mocha shot him""
Bitch I'm going hard
It ain't no stopping, do that for the bottom
Everybody watching, Gates a great and he just made it out
Everything I make from profit
God I promise, I'll invest in houses
Just give me another chance at life
Put me back in bounce
Went to jail, already had my stripes
Ain't no backing down

In 7th Grade, we promised that we'd never break each other's heart
Fought with the pressure of deep depression while naked making confessions
Underneath the covers, coloring in the dark
Gave LaToya my information and she ain't even call
Could it be women's intuition telling her I'm a dog?
Criminally involved, past-tense on my prior history dealing with the law
And this is no facade, refrigerator in my chest just like Omarion
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Excuse - that's just a broken heart
I'll think that I'll just hang out here for tonight
(Say Gates, what you doing?)
Playing songs on my invisible guitar

Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand
Alone, praying every day that I can stop thinking about you
But I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby
I would go to war with God for you, baby
I'd go to war with God for you, baby

[Verse 2]
Every time we talk, it's like you end up getting aroused
Standing, while I'm sitting down with my fingers under your blouse
Still looking you in the eye, you're looking back into mine
If I told you I was different, would you understand the difference?
Try to suppress the feeling of this different way of living
Creatures of the night - we gon be alright
In the twilight
Skin gleamin', labeled a demon cause I can't even die
The curse of eternity - God created me, but why?
If I turn you into I, your age would never age and forever be by my side
Spoke about the wisdom that entered into my thoughts
The will of the universe, including the Willendorf
This is art
I'm a God

Every night, I kiss your picture on the nightstand
Love's a battlefield, it's not a one-night stand

Wrap the phone up in plastic and stick it in the fridge

Sticking to the code, they'll listen to the song

People are basic, they thought I was crazy
Hard with the witchcraft, study every night
Philosopher's Stone, I perform another rite
Rite meaning ritual, created dry ice
Hid in plain sight with the suit and tie nice
Mason mean more than a brick layer

Find another way to eat, I'mma quit slanging

Thumbing through the law books (And he know the law?)
Sent a hit in Baton Rouge (And he getting off?)
Third-eye focused (Wonder what he saw?)
Power in the tongue (Bullets in your car)
You ain't want it, had it on you, tried to pull it but you lost
War never knew mercy
Our Lady of the Lake won't receive you with open arms
You in yellow tape
Maluchie goin' stupid, he'll do it every day
Talking 'bout leaving your grandmother, and will do it in your face
Shitting in the jack nigga, you got do-do in your face
What you doing? Don't you know it ain't no doing it with Gates?
Peculiar, oolier, noodle your grape
Lot of days spent in the cage, wasn't what you think
Washing clothes with the toilet water, drinking out the sink
Hard mat hurt your back when it's no option
Everybody boxed in, trying to release toxins
[Hook]
Fuck a meeting, we about to have a sit down
Not a part of this, pussy nigga can't sit 'round
Bread Winner business, model bitches getting dicked down
Get the phone back when they finish, get em' kicked out
All in favor of a favor for a favor
Any other matter we gon' bring it to the table
Organization gotta have communication
Full participation, Bread Winners in the making
Fuck a meeting, we about to have a sit down
Got the bread invested then we split it with the clique now
Bought a share together, people feel like we the shit now
Passing through your section I ain't showing no affection to a nigga or a bitch
Take a whiff, no you sick now
Syrup, drinking out the bottle how I sip now
Ride around the bottom with the tint down
I'm a shooter, got a pistol with the dick out
True story, what I rap about I lived out
That's why I got a pistol with the dick out

[Verse 2]
Fucked up feeling when you get it from the gutter
Be the people in your own hood steady saying fuck ya
Way a nigga living, when you see me in the picture
Difficult to tell the difference in the season when I'm thuggin'
Heart cold, long nose, thumpin' through the jungle
Automatic that I'm packing, wearing jackets in the summer
Body being healed, having trouble with my left foot
Learned how to fight different, caught him with the left hook
Really pushing D, with the clip, cooking Ki's
Many probably agree, on TV was the best look
Anticipated launch or a lift-off
Metaphor, going opposite of dick-soft
Mind on the ticket, out the mud
Seen Nicki album cover would make the dick spit, but it's still soft
Get out my cell when I shit, get lost
I'll punch a nigga down when I'm pissed off
Wanna wrestle, had to put him in a hip-toss
Lot of rap niggas backwards, Kris Kross
Guess I never had swag
Pants tight on your ass, matter fact while you at it, put on lip gloss
Mind rambling, I guess it kinda slipped off
When Drake and Rihanna's song ""Take Care"" playing tears running down my face I ain't playing, miss laying with my bitch having real-talks
Laying in her lap with her fingers in my scalp, get to rubbing on my back till I drift off (sleep)
Affection ain't cheap, coming with cost
Paying all the bills when the rent call
Fucking with a NFL player when his check long
Running back as if a running-back
Hard to stomach that you let him fuck for nothing when you find out that the check gone (check gone)
Found a ex-NBA player knowing that's wrong
Unloyal, it's law you get stepped on
Who your baby daddy? Picked me but you guessed wrong
Your mother mad cause she couldn't pawn me
Got it from the concrete
Will stand up in your chest under everybody
What you witnessing me getting richer failed to mention that I'm winning
Same nigga that you slept on

[Verse 1]
Gladiators on deck, drug user, don’t drink Sprite
And when I do, it ain't pink Sprite, a lot of lean, it’s purple
Trust issue, don't trust really, no two point conversion
Won't run it after I touch down, my punter kicking, it's defense
(What you get into this weekend?)
Where was you when I was slumped over?
Gums hurting from a old bullet
In front the toilet while hunched over
Puking all of my insides, stab wounds from a old friend
Well at that time we were close friends
They say I killed him in cold blood
We wrestled for the gun but the gun went off
He up’d the pistol, looked him dead in his eyes
I been ready to die so nigga, do it
""Gates lying,"" I'll really do it
I’m serious too, nigga, really do it
Turned his head, closed his eyes
Aimed the tool, started shooting
I didn’t die, my life a movie

And your children are somewhere on the corner

When I was touching McKinley, Erin really my best friend
And I was loving her best friend, bright Brittany with the long hair
You know Flavar Lloyde lil' sister
She stole a Jag for to come and get me
I was buying dope, in and out the system
Brandy fucking my nigga Ray
At the same time, fuckin' Coach Whitney
He the track coach, and a asshole
Know that didn't have shit to do with this
I was just stating the facts though
Jessica round me, talking sexual bout me
She bend over in front me from the back while I'm pounding
Now it's over, bitch get up and get out
I mostly likely forgot to mention, but we was in my trap house
Just brainstorming, in the game forming these thoughts into ideas
No regrets for the shit I did; that also mean for the niggas I killed!

Got to be a bitch with ass, BWA
How you know us, we don't even know your name

Got a bad bitch in Lafayette, and like 50 grand on that fuck shit

Niggas throwing water cause they know they watered down

Lingo, what up? (Yo) What up? (I go) dumb (and) retawdid' (What else?)

2 and a 16 ounce Sprite, I'm leaning right now
My phone be going dumb and that bitch ringing right now
Pull up in them ghosts (runny runny)

Jet Life out his body, beat it, Brasi!
People get behind me I ain't slowing or I'm going, I'mma cum all on ya first for I even pull out
Video coming on MTV, I don't really give a fuck, long as every hood know it
Hashtag BMTP, bring me the pussy and bring ID
Not the average girl from the videos, bumping India Arie
If you pussy, change the subject, paparazzi
Caught me tongue kissing a pint while out in public, caught me
Got to be a bitch with ass to be BWA
Can't fuck with bartender Cherrish cause, that ho pussy stank

I'm cryin' ""shame"", nigga main line wanna fuck with Luca Brasi
Every time we around each other I can feel her eyes watching
My Roley game time give a Colorado rocky
Met a freak from Denver called her freaky Colorado
Pussy ooh, juicier than sushi with no avocado
And I don't do insecure and he don't want her for the motto
What it do, Bailey's Irish Cream, drinking out the bottle
She get loose, like drinking chocolate martini moscatto
Pouring juice, lick it off her nipples in love what I got her
Told her crew, freaky things we do, now they wanna holla
Confused, but what's it to you? On twitter they follow
Stuck my tongue all in her ass, you should seen the way she wobble32Embed"

Ay, you could be so used to somethin', man
You know everyday you grow, everyday you changin'
And I never tried to change on you but it's just like
I had to do it by myself for so long to where when you come back into my life it just don't feel right like
Feel like somethin's missin'
And you feel like - you just feel different
So you gotta forgive me if I act strange wit'chu
Never changed wit'chu

[Chorus]
This is a burden that none of us want
The judge broke us up when I went back to court
Sentenced the time and it tore us apart
Beautiful creature and I know what you are
Prayed no one else get control of your heart
I hold it down, I was built for this part
Been away too long
I no longer know who you are
But I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again, love
I'll find you again, I'll find you again
I'll find you again, love, I'll find you again

[Verse 1]
All I knew was run it up and try to stack, stay focused
One day you be up to bat and I'm on it
Fingernails, tryna scrape
With the safety pin break it down to crack, whoever want it
Movin' reckless wit' the Gat, I protect the pack
I be stayin' strapped, niggas tryna jack, bitches tryna trap
Maybe it's perhaps, I be in the trap
And I got them racks near, stroked up, we keep it on the lap, you know how I'm comin'
Fall in the pen, I dive in your shit
I'm one in a million, I'm standin' on ten
Hit your bitch from the back, I supply her with dick
She was a virgin when she was with him
Showed her somethin', fuck everyone else
I can't give you the world but I give you myself
If you was loyal put my love on the shelf
You are now just a notch on the belt
Guess I'll find someone else but I ain't got time for no one else
Grind hard, Glendale bein' chauffeured
Panoramic roof, in here we smokin'
Legal pistol anybody approachin' (boom!)
In your name in case we get pulled over (woo, woo)

We was all utterly rejected
We went from nothin' to somethin' together
People like what the fuck you see in her?
To you they like what the fuck you see in him?
Why you love him? You shouldn't trust him
He's a fuck up, so disgustin' and your family's sayin' fuck me
I'm successful and now they love me
Marble Slab, our first kiss
Recollectin' the night that you told me you need me
Told Tyra, ""Baby, gimme the keys""
Put a dick on my hip on the highway, I'm speedin'
Just had a argument, you was too busy
I would get upset whenever you would leave me (don't leave me)
Joe changed form, got 'em tatted on my arm
Felt so alone and it wasn't easy
Late nights, grandmother's house
Talkin' takin' over the world together
Helped me through my insecurities
Sayin' you was gonna be my world forever
I comforted you through the death of our child
Had our first girl together
Our love is a fire inside and it's gon' burn forever

This is a burden that none of us want

Don't talk to me!

And the way that you call , like you never had dick at all
Kissing in the car
While in the park garage you go slipping off your bra
Oh, oh, damn your titties soft lifting up your skirt , slip your panties off oh, oh
Hands all over your body!
Licking on it all no feelings involved
Watching water fall took no time at all, pussy
What we doing won't hurt nobody!

Love the way you smell love to feel your skin
Hands together, I'mma hold them back
Put the head in, and I throw it back
Arch you all the way to the ceiling
Get your booty licked while you make it clap
Uh, I'm nasty! A lot of tattoos get at me
Face underneath your waist
While my fingers scratching your scalp
You keep squirming all on my couch
You left nipple all in my mouth!
Ask them hoes about me, I kill pussy
I know you know what's that about!
[Hook:]
Looks like I've seen you in my dreams, or in a magazine
People asking who are we (when we roll around)
Though things are not as they may seem
Won't you like the you want me
Skip to this bed room scene
And it's going down!
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion
Strokin in slow motion

[Bridge:]
Now turn around
Sweating like a storm cuz we dont kid around
After this you could tell all your girlfriends
How I just dick you down!
While kissing on your shoulders, and I make you bend over
Give this dick like I'm supposed to
I'm strokin in slow motion
I'm strokin, now hold on17Embed"

I ain't tryna know your business

But I'm just tryna fuck with you
And girl I'm tryna hit that pussy one time
One time one time will be cool
Wassup with it? Wassup with it?
Wassup with it? Wassup with you?

[Verse 1]
FaceTiming you from New York, phone sexing while we apart
Since the death of your lover you started fuckin' with busters
Had to take off the gloves, tryna feel it under the covers
Stickin' dick in your ribs and you squealin', tell me you love it
Affection showin' in public I love the kissin' you own it
Saying that Kevin's too aggressive, maybe one day he may mellow out
Pressure when we sexin', with friends you makin' confessions
But I'm married to my hustle, ain't no way that we can settle down
Grip that ass bae I don't get tired

[Hook]
I ain't tryna know your business
I ain't tryna fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
I be runnin' through the streets like I'm speed racin'
Fresh outta prison took some trips, but never been to Vegas
You found it funny when I stated I was on vacation
Back seat of a Tahoe but this time no shackles on my ankles
Now we go hard and we awesome, after work hit the line
I dip through pick you up when you off then go grab a bite but won't spoil you
Yeah I go dumb I'm retarded, gangstas salute when I'm walkin' Take you home, break your back
When you leave, after that I won't call you
(I don't get tired)

[Verse 3]
Hard to keep up with my lingo when I'm in the matrix
Exclusive word uses gets confusing but wait I'll explain it
Commitment-shy from past relationships I guess I'm tainted
You could love or love me not, I ain't ever changing
I ain't ever changing
Can't be something that I'm not, I ain't ever changing
I ain't ever changing
You posed to judge by what's on the inside
I ain't ever changing

These tats on my face don't mean nothin'
I was locked up, that don't mean nothin'
When you make it through the struggle it tend to mean hustle
The only one in my life to come to mean something

[Hook]
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
When you tat my name on, it make me know it's real
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
What you say you don't do girl, you know I will
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
Still surprised you haven't noticed it yet
The realest you ever met

[Verse 1]
I hustle on back page, now I got her face down
Frownin' why she take it, she don't like to make sounds
Bought a one way ticket, put her on the Greyhound
Workin' our hotels right before they played out
What's the problem? Why you not smilin'? We in the prime of our life
Supposed to be havin' the time of our life
Excuse the misunderstandin', sometimes you be so demandin'
Don't like to be told what to do, difficult but we manage
Said some things I didn't mean, caused emotional damage
I love the streets, I'm a gangster, I like to be in them daily
Your mother love me like a son but I'm not seein' me changin'
A lot of built up frustration due to past situations
[Hook]
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
When you tat my name on, it make me know it's real

I'm just the realest that you done met
I'm just the realest that you done met
Still surprised you haven't noticed it yet
The realest you ever met

[Verse 2]
Turned a hooker to a housewife and people say ""how?""
Million dollar vision, you just gotta stay down
Take your pride out of the situation
Don't get all in your feelin's they gon' throw your weight around
Ah shit
She gon' kill herself if I leave but she know I don't play around
I got one text in this evenin', say she just made it in town
Wonderin' if I could see her, got some things to figure out
I ain't mean it, I was bluffin', thinkin' please don't leave me now
Boys II Men, I'm down on bended knees listenin' to The Weeknd
Now friends hate me sayin' ""girl look when did he get out?""
My mother left when I was young
I'm commitment shy so when feelin's get involved I tend to run
Sometimes emotions get the best of me clearly
And I ain't never tried to straddle no fences
Been back and forth for a minute
And I know I seem reluctant
I've been hurt and you the only one that mean somethin'
[Hook]
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel
When you tat my name on, it make me know it's real
I ain't too hard to tell you how I feel

For a long, long, long time

I woke up feelin' like I couldn't feel no better
I don' want no fuckin' alka seltzer
I woke up feelin' like I couldn't feel no better
Momma pray for me my friends fake I need a hundred steppers
They hate the flick of my wrist
Really be wheelin' the benz
Video vixen look here
Squealin' while I'm stickin' dick in her ribs
I told her I was a beautician whip out the scissors get rid of split ends
I'm full of myself bae I'm trippin'
Feel like I'm Brady whatever it is
I-I'm catchin' plays, I-I mean Kevin Gates
Millz I ain't got no chill, Breadwinner heavyweight ooh
Look who just sat at the table make yo ho go fetch him a plate
Then I pull up in the Porsche bet whoever willin' to race
Charges dismissed by the feds
Still gotta deal with the state
Whoop em I got plenty kush and you pussy
Pick 12 or somebody gon' lay in yo bushes
Two time convicted a stitch for the fully
Jump out I'm feeling no need for the hoodie
Streets love a nigga who really a gangsta
Go check my jacket you know I'ma pull it
Ar-Ab hit the line I'm like what's the business
Just find the lean I'ma sip it I don't trust no bitches
Look at the flick of that wrist
Video from the back how I'm killin' ya bitch
Lovin' my swag MC Hammer
Want to quit but I'm just 2 legit
Baltimore Oriole's hat Mr. Gates
Corner to corner they flooded with H
Hit the corner sto' backwoods and antropo
Money order 2 stamps and a envelope
Commissary in prison, they money low
Jumpin' and dodgin' the fence like I'm Mario
Camera belt buckle these rats catchin' audio
Runnin' the money up workin' no cardio
Left out of Boston and visited Denver
We had a threesome but we don't remember
Res from the grigy still stuck to my fingertips
Twistin' the stink stimulated my mental
SLS 550 matching interior while at the red light I stay lookin' serious
Want to question me I don't know nothing 'bout shit in kentucky I'm dealin' with Benjamin
Elephant whippin' the trunk in the front
But I still cannot figure out where the ignition is
While at the airport I'm being surrounded
I'm thinkin of flyin in private
All in the bathroom with my flight attendant
Ho why is yo hand in my privates?
On IG I talk I be lively
In public I'm movin' in silence
Penitentiary rules in effect
Give respect if I don't get it back I get violent
Carol City straight drop got em wildin'
Me June and Boola and Poo out our body
Oughta see my new bitch she exotic
Wasn't talkin bout you ho be quiet
Silver shadow Jaber reversible stock my new girl
I keep her right on side of me
Back to jail while suspected of robbery
Jumpin' bond I won't sign out my property
You think Brasi got bodies well probably
Dive in the crowd he a gangsta so possibly
Watch the rappers few bitch niggas knockin' me cuz
They bird and they chickens want flock to me
All in New York be with Maino and Capo
I rode by myself and ain't nobody stoppin' me
Ain't no more real niggas
I'm who Jay-Z and Kanye like to listen to honestly
They probably won't tell you that honestly
Super polite got a record that follow me
Tommy Hilfiger vest with the Guess denim jeans
Kango cap on ya top with the wallabees
Johnny Blaze she can sing like Rihanna but ratted on dude
It took everything out of me
Amber Rose had messed up with my nigga
When I get the rip I expect her to lie to me
Soldier sign in the middle of my forehead
A broke motherfucka who hatin don't bother me!

Aye look I don't know how to be you bitch ass niggas
All I know how to be is me Yah heard me?
You can't say man I fuck with Gates then say something negative in the same sentence
Man that don't even go together ol' bitch ass nigga

Bitch you something so serious
It's recording?
(They say diamonds are forever)

[Verse 1:]
Public thought me a pessimist think my thoughts too pessimistic
Reminiscing
Roastin' Garcia Vegas, just don't do swishers or rillas
Murder rap, we beat it 2am and two-seated
Yellow things bright embrace, I arch it back and lay
Face down, I'm a gangsta my heart colder than Chicago
This black Impala just sent bullets through my car door
These niggas I've been runnin' wit' pressure hit they crumblin'
Never had no love in this shit, pray to God, somebody pray for me
Deep conversation was always elated and then celebrated the things of the past
Happy belated, while handing her Franklins, just thought I was stated, but stated too fast
Went to the pen, and was living upstate but feel I got away cause I skated with cash
Made crooked lawyers and dirty attorneys, who take all your money and say that they working
Fucking with you, stuck in this loop you jumping through hoops and we running through hurdles
Ain't meet ya momma but I told her I promise that when she around me nothing will hurt her
She do the talking I can't be too personal, lean drinking, no Bud Light
Itching for them chickens them idiots must don't love life
[Hook]
Free to speak on anything at all
Before we met, not much belief in
Anything at all
And then we found love under neon lights
Fluorescent body paint
While under neon lights
Lemme get you to sound off, loud in here
But say my name, loud and clear
Watch we wake up all the neighbors when we makin' love
I'm talking naked, making faces, really cuttin' up
In the bathroom, or the shower let this water fall
Like Soulja Slim I got enough dick for all of y'all
Now the luxury whips come equipped with neon lights
Body paint fluorescent under neon lights
Fuck what he don't like, we gon' be alright
Cookin' soft and selling hard while under neon lights

[Verse 2]
Bread Winner Mafia ? we poppin' in climates with tropical leaves
Take off my shirt can't come out my sleeves I got it in ink then it's what I believe
Exploring desires this moment devours I'm watching this fire ignite in the sheets
Kissing my wrist, got her legs on my shoulder my dick in her stomach I'm giving her ""D""
She, grippin' the pillow with teeth, I wrinkle my lip she wiggles her feet
Built up a tolerance now while inside of it hollerin louder she get it with speed
This is we. They say diamonds are forever
Boyfriend called her and cussed her out (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal girl)
Cling on got the theme song on my ringtone I'mma beef with you everytime you leave home
Tell em that the plan that I'll have you scared better tell em I'll catch em I'll tell em whatever what up
Name in the streets and I stand on that spit my life through the wax I'mma die bout that
Outside make it 4th of July bout that
And they say diamonds are forever (I'm forreal girl, I'm forreal)
From start to finish Go-Karts Assembled sayin life's but a race put the petal to the metal
Sayin ready, set, go now start ya engine
On a 90-day run we thought was different
We still keep in touch no loss in feelings but a understanding

Thrown in crosses, took some losses, never complained, I went got it

I'm your guardian angel (Who?), and it translates into Kevin (Kevin)
No love like mine, another lifetime, we used to be together (We used to be together)
It hurt my heart to see you hurt, in desperate need of affection
Gave up my wings and fell in love, was 'posed to be your protector
Love somebody else, you broke my heart and it's just not getting better
The angels telling me that God won't let me back into Heaven
Bae, I'm tired of playing games with you
I know inside, you feel the same way I do
We the reciprocal of one another, come from the same star
We got the same moles under our nose and we got the same scars
LA Fitness, wasn't surprised at all, we driving the same car
Same mall, shopping on impulse, I don't find it odd

Your majesty
The royal court's decision is respected and it's entirely part of Breadwinner world court and executive style
But we both know our exercise of passionate speech by fluctuation of tone and pitch
May have aroused unwanted recollections of negative occurrences
But no harm would've ever come to one possessing royal blood from dying on hand
For as we move in the signs of love, true peace, freedom, and justice
Only he that draws his sword shall be met with brute force
If you would've decreed that matter saying we were cleared for departure
I would've threw it all away and accepted whatever ridicule or consequence behind my actions
For I believe in our love
And one day maybe in this eternity or another
You'll see yourself for what I know you to be
A queen
If you ever need me for anything, this line never changes
Such is my love for you
For you are me, and I am you
I'm in love with you
The short moments we shared will forever be appreciated
I never withheld anything from you because my heart rests securely with you
I know you'd never do me a bitch ass thing
My heart will forever hurt to be in your arms
But at least we both know I'm willing to die for my beliefs
'Cause I've died for you before
And regret it not
For I did it all for the glory of love
In closing
I remain the same, I come as I leave
Upright, independent, and fearless
We just both good at pretending
I love you forever

Confrontation is the conversation
Your contact - erased it
Can't take it - no patience
Major mistake is me believing in you when you say shit
I thought you changed well since you can't I can no longer take it
Go head and face it, plain and basic, different occasions
Gave you my trust and you apologized and then betrayed it
Shame on me, further repeat, I'm all out of favors
And nothing else can save you...
Guessin' you missing integrity
Still gotta focus on what's in the head of me
Great understanding of me as a whole, probably one of the reasons you scared of me
Fiction you telling me, stupid expecting me
Thinking that Imma believe in what I'm not believing

Never say never again, though a facade is the way to pretend
Never be basic again, a stage ain't for the faint hearted
Processed it all, but I ain't bought it
But thank god, I can thank god
Fell in a miserable state, when no one you fuck with will look in your face
Wake up alone when the weather get lonely
You'll be the only one you can blame
Shit ain't the same though as it was plain
Focusin damn and go hard in the paint, fuck with the K
It affect when you grindin'
I own the prize, and you're more like a lion
Soar like a eagle, without all the lying, trying
Trying to be something you not, I say I got, you say you got
I say I'm not, you say you tried it, If it happen to me then it happened to you
Or someone you know, or someone you fuck with
A lot shit be counterfeit, you no longer someone I fuck with..
[Hook]
Ahhhh
Own up to your bullshit
Yeah its about that time, damn don't you look foolish
Cause you know, I know, you know you lyin'
Yeah right, uh huh, yeah right mhmm, yeah right stop lyin'
Yeah right, uh huh, yeah right mhmm, yeah right stop lyin'

[Outro]
On everything that I love, everything that I love
On everything that I love, man I had enough
On everything that I love, everything I love
On everything that I love, man I had enough
Ahhhh
Own up to your bullshit
Yeah its about that time, damn don't you look foolish

Say bruh, I love you to death but bitch you gon' hit it, or you gon' lay on top of it
Get the fuck up nigga, you ain't dead yet

[Verse 1]
Just got this word from above, placing my heart in this message
Evil's after your soul, people smart with deceptions
Keep a sharp observation, allowing no infiltration
Of those you let in your circle
They get the chance, they gon' hurt you
They be counting your pockets and you can tell by they comments
Incident with my car, when my nigga wanted to drive it
I told him no, he flashed out, texting my phone talking violent
And told me put him in a song and he was catchin' a body
God protected my body, I fear no nigga breathin'
I feel like David and Goliath, a hungry pack of hyenas
Showing they teeth when I'm eating
Bitch, do it look like I'm cheesing?
Took my lick like a man
Then came home to the streets
No defeat!

[Hook]
When everyone's around I bet you had a ball
Killing emotional attachments with the alcohol
They say they love you and that for you they do anything
You find it awkward that their eyes don't say the same thing
Changing, lately, beware of smiling faces
Entangling, betraying, beware of smiling faces
[Verse 2]
These murders weigh on my conscience as I take too many showers
I need a woman to hold me, help me forget all my problems
It's 5 a.m in Toronto, being she down here for college
She says her major's psychology we're both into astrology
This moscato was sweet, inhaling sticks of this broccoli
Hard to sleep on the side of me, seeming too much is bothering me
Memories haunting me, jumping up out my sleep
She might say ""Babe it's OK"", then put me straight back to sleep
I do this three or four times, my life on constant repeat
Reason I can't quit syrup, my anxiety be fucking with me
Every bitch I'm with, find out I ain't shit
After three weeks of just fucking with me
It's a fucked up feeling when you looking in the mirror
Everybody just pretending they fucking with me
Who fucking with me?!

Goin' hard for 'em in the paint, never had a real family
That nigga, I call daddy

They was already making music
I just added rap talent
Came out of prison pursuing my dream now everybody mad at me
I ain't never try to diss y'all
All I ever did was tell the truth
Pray every one of y'all artists make it
Don't or do, I still salute
Got real niggas, from New Orleans
All they do is click homers
Made men don't make statements
You bigger than that, that's phony
Want every nigga that rap, from Louisiana to make it
Medication then meditation and elevatin' to greatness

Gave you niggas my all and you mistreat your niggas
Now I can't see you niggas

Say, Mike
Sometimes it's painful to relive the past
But sometimes you gotta relive the past in order to heal from it
I just told Richie we rich
I'm him

[Chorus]
I'm a prisoner in my own mind
I feel like these walls talkin' to me
I feel like these walls talkin' to me (In my own mind)
Prisoner in my own mind
I feel like these walls talkin' to me
I feel like these walls talkin' to me (In my own mind)

I feel like these walls talkin' to me
I feel like these walls talkin' to me (In my own mind)

[Verse 1]
I was young when my mama had me
Think I ran away from home 'bout the age of fifteen, juvenile detention
Talked about behind my back by my family members
H-hurtful feeling bein' the black sheep every family visit
I'll admit it, bein' young, I made some bad decisions
Heart too big, I guess my loyalty got used against me
Learned to focus on myself, now I got tunnel vision
Kicked in my ass when I was down and went through hell to get back
Been to the group homes, I've been on lockdown and I've been upstate
Lived in a few homes, holdin' the block down, movin' this weight
Never spoke on this, they say that I murdered my best friend
It was just business, it wasn't personal, you know how the world is
[Chorus]
I'm a prisoner in my own mind
I feel like these walls talkin' to me
I feel like these walls talkin' to me (In my own mind)
Prisoner in my own mind

I feel like these walls talkin' to me
I feel like these walls talkin' to me (In my own mind)
Get 'em, Gates

[Verse 2]
I'm 'bout to clear my heart
Stand on the business and ain't ever fold
I got some uncles who killers (For real)
Who baggin' someone who ain't play by the code (Yeah)
My favorite rapper my cousin (Yeah)
I looked up to him ever since we was kids (For real)
Hope that he know that I love him
Guess all good things must come to an end
I know some industry niggas
And they never lived the way I lived
Sayin' I'm anti-social (What?)
I can't make you feel the way I feel (Uh-huh)
Head up high, got great ideas
'Cause I got blackballed and they scared of me
I'll die for you if I care for you
I'ma ride for you, never change up, love

I'm a great friend, I'm just not a friend
And I'ma die for you if I care for you
I'ma ride for you, never change up, love
And I'll admit it, bein' young, I made some bad decisions
Heart too big, that's when my loyalty got used against me

Squat made the beat
I bought a brick from Gustavo's
I'm lookin' out for debacles
Go Grizz
I bought a crib in Morocco

[Chorus]
You shoulda just let me have you
I could've made you so happy
But I don't do second chances
Everything, man what happened?
Forever I wish you happiness
Never do this again
But I fell in love wit' a dancer

[Post Chorus]
I don't wanna be without your love tonight
Whenever I'm with you it feels like paradise
Mix a few mistakes with wrongs and rights
When you listen to your heart it gives you sound advice

[Verse 1]
I'm that nigga you want
I'm that nigga you love
When you met me, you knew I was a plug
You know I was your drug
Not bein' mannish
Hope you not bashful
Can I just grab a handful of ass?
And not to harass you
Had to just ask you
Kiss on your panties
Lick on your panther
Bowlegged stance, I love how you standin'
I love how you starin' at a nigga
Embarrassin' a little
I'm a little shy, I had to admit it
I'm a little fly, I had to admit it
Just went viral on my Insta
Where I'm likin' all your pictures
Yellow gold like I'm Muammar Gaddafi on these niggas

Pull up in my new Tahoe
Bought a brick from Gustavo
Lookin' out for debacles
Free my nigga Muhammad you know we visit in Cabo

Takin' them trips, meet at the port, you know I will
Thuggin' a sport, you know I'm real
Don't gotta rep, you know I kill
I don't eat pork and I don't squeal
Fly you out, sit down and chill
Beat that pussy from behind, bitch, bend over, you know I drill
Your lil' dude too insecure, why he worried about the kid?
Why he speaking on my name? Don't he know I get it in
You want smoke? Then it'll get there, pronto
Fix your attitude

Don't play around with love, under the love spell

(Women are smart)
Don't play around with love, under the love spell
Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
Women are smart
She was tryna hit him with the whoop, tryna catch him
She was tryna put it in his food, tryna trap him
Maybe underneath the full moon, night of passion
Thinking he'll fall deeply in love from attraction

She was tryna hit him with the whoop, tryna catch him
She was tryna put it in his food, tryna trap him
Maybe underneath the full moon, night of passion
Thinking he'll fall deeply in love from attraction

[Verse 1]
I was in a pretty cool mood, needed action
I pull up in something vroom vroom, push your back in
I was in a very dark place, I wasn't happy
You came in my life and that balance got established
Don't play around with love, under the love spell
Don't be touching me, I'm delicate, you need to be fucked well
Your boyfriend a detective, hit from the back, say fuck 12
With your water, you just cover me and bae say, ""Aw, yeah""

She was tryna put it in his food, tryna trap him

I'm in your stomach, I'm in your ribs, I'm ringing your love bell
I'm on your mind, they callin' you that
I hit decline, ain't calling you back
I been neglected, showing affection
I got protection from all of that
I'm on the grind, I'm balling with stacks
It was a blessing to be in my presence
You wasn't fine before all of that
You a finesser, got a lil' stress
I wasn't applyin', I'm fallin' back
I got a new dancer
Whenever I'm smashin', she go to scratching
Look like a panther just been climbing on my back

Never on no chain
Always throwing crosses that's what lil' hoes get
Claim to be a boss but you a lil' broke bitch
Reason you alive thank the niggas you run wit
I was in a cell witchu and you ain't run shit
Told me put my shoes on, But
You ain't scratch
I wreck hall and jack off and then was so laid back
For niggas you would make calls, Don't that sound like draft
When I call a bitch in love she get here oh so fast
Fucking right I read my bible, I believe in god
Yeah you punched me in my shit but you did not hit hard (laughs)

Rather stand alone before I pull a nigga dick
All you pussy rappers just be pulling niggas dick (ya bitch)

Behind my name I'm standing tall and will die any day
As I grew wise I thought that I would put that foolish pride away
If you cross can't take a loss, I can't walk away (I can't)

R-E-S-P-E-C-T this heat, I keep that Glock with me
Caught two pistol charges still got my L's and reciprocity
Never be a celebrity, all this beef where the broccoli
I'm obviously not wrapped to tightly, You probably better off offing me
A nigga better watch how he talk to me, Like how I watch how I talk on my cell
Don't answer my phone from rap niggas, I get calls way more often from jail (hello)
Swear it was so hot out on my block we all thought it was hell
On the L's, sippin' syrup tryna mend this broken heart from all the betrayal
Sold it before it got off the scale, Re-up and do it again
Shot it out so many times, Got to see who was truly my friends
I was one deep in deep thought
Thinking everybody tryna con or cross me
It's getting hard to be humble tryna get this bad karma off me

But it probably was in vein, Cause you won't score shit
Brugh talk about me bad, I'm like not my boy
When I got his bitch pregnant bet it broke his heart
Gone ahead and get some get back or fuck my bitch
I'll let you in on a lil' secret nigga she not shit,

Where we go from here, If I leave the block
A little money fine but I need a lot
Take a preachers route but dont lie to people
I ain't never seen anything in the sky
Clean in the ride, what I mean that I'm fly
With a bitch super mean, bumpin' lean to the side
I was thinkin bout any means I could try
I believe in a high!
Being logical gave me a reason to doubt
Scheme for things I was dreaming
In a magazine article reading about
Face card, I ain't got to pay for drugs
It comes free with the artificial look
Could I just do me, Let me be me
I ain't arguin' for much
I'm with this bitch and I feel free
She don't demand of me for much
My sex drive been at an all time low
I can barely get it up!
Tryin' to keep another mother fucker happy
Swear I'm givin' up!
Drug usage is increasing since the last time
Been gone awhile and I'll be back just like the last time
Racks on me, stacks on me, Travel hard
One nation under God!
In the car alone, prayin' to the stars
Engine roaring, make a joyful noise
Praise be to Allah, come this far or not!
Cocaine, foreign car, look who takin' off!
Throwin' money at my nigga
Younger sister really wishin' he was with us
But look who takin' off!
Band for you to keep, love I'm finna leave
So I guess I'm taking off!
No one will love you like I do so never hesitate to call
Know I could always count on you to always have me there at all
Good hearted if you think wrong
How could you be right?
Four niggas fuckin' the same bitch
She pop up pregnant this can't be life
Get rid of the bitch, 'fore I get rid of you bitch
I'm sick of you bitch
No hands on ya, rubberbands on ya, I ain't talkin' like a stripper
Pay they do it, send razors through, spray the kay and make you flip
Only reason I ain't kill your mother
Strength of her daughter
And she cheats everyday on your daddy
Tryin' to give orders
Then they try to extort a gangsta, I'm someone important
Don't step in my office, I ain't about no talkin'
Be sippin' my coffee while bullets is sparkin'
Without any caution, now watch who I'm crossin'
Boobie is awesome, catch up if I lost ya
With this I went off
My grandpa a gangsta, he died I went off
Don't interrupt me while I am recordin'
Shit so depressing, I wish I could pause it
Misunderstand it, put that in a coffin'
Back to the margin, re-up and get off it
Label an orphan, Lane of my own
I got the hawkin, I am retarted
Know theres a name, don't know what to call it

No ones watchin' but the angels
My hearts been takin' by this angel

Ever wonder why your bitch look funny when the music playing
Been a gangster safe to say that I live everything I'm saying

I was getting in the mail through UPS
If I tell you I'ma stay away from Juliet
I'ma lying
Everybody around you pretending that they your partner (Woah!)
Let you have a problem they won't even help you out (Woah!)
Smiling in your face, you turn your back they talk about you
I've been abused by this cold, cold world

Lord I'm going hard I'm stacking all my benjamins
Swear to God that I can't wait to shit on all my friends again
I'ma pull up Benz again, p-p-pull up Benz again
I'ma pull up Benz again, p-p-pull up Benz again25Embed"

My heart, my heart, callin' out to you
In the arms of a stranger, callin' out to you
And we don't even talk anymore
Never knew separation anxiety before
Every time the leaves are changing
It's the loneliest time of year

[Verse 1]
Wait hold on baby, you don't have to leave let's talk it out
If you say you're no longer happy, you can turn around
Burn all my belongings if you can't figure it out
I don't really need those things anyhow
But every time the lights go down in the room
... me and you
Never meant to say all those things causing so much pain
Now my thoughts on the floor so confused
Listen to .....

[Hook]
My heart, my heart, callin' out to you
In the arms of a stranger, callin' out to you
And we don't even talk anymore
Never knew separation anxiety before
Every time the leaves are changing
It's the loneliest time of year
[Verse 2]
My favorite book's The Notebook by author Nicholas Sparks
Built a staircase just to runaway, but she won't make it far
Every time the leaves start changing we're lonely just like before
And I don't really need those things anyhow
Her bein' the reason why I can smile
Settle down, think I know a real fly place
A coffee shop around the block from where I once stayed

Gettin' it in, gotta win, we not kickin' it

Whippin' machines equipped with a fridge in it
We the connect, we not bout to mention it
We with the shit, no talkin', we finish it
Some say I'm ignorant
Mecca, we touchin' September, I'm making my pilgrimage (Allahu Akbar)
Maybe I'm different
Looked at you like you were special, you not even built for this
UFOs in the crush Gates
So when it's up niggas goin' nuts
Big shit tucked, toolie on clutch
Pockets on lump, free my nigga Lump
Goin' out dumb
Engine on run
Thuggin' in the slums
Thumbin' through the hun's
Separate the ones
(Somebody called a riot?)
My daughter get the violets
Break bread, slidin', lay up in the Hyde
Room too expensive
Motel 6 and bitch quit trippin'

Dabbed in, front pockets stuffed
Money look like we been doin' lunges
Raised up in the blunt, I'm doin' crunches
Tattooed all over my stomach
Out in London talkin' to Big London
Stand up in they chest, okay I love you
Niggas hatin', wait I'm doin' numbers
In they feelin's, tell 'em I say fuck 'em
Hold up, wait, tell 'em that I love 'em
We could go, we had a discussion
Fame tend to blind the people on the side of you like you never mean nothin'
Focus on brand new things
Tryna show my children how to hustle
Teach 'em how to trust one another
All we got is us and your mother
Fall down, get back up again
Lose it all right before you win
Kevin man, you messin' up your gift
Shit like this be hard to come again
Fall bad, I know I admit it
Real struggle, I don't ever quit it
Thinkin' back when I ain't have a cent
Back when I ain't have a shit to give

Watch yo' mouth, no dissin' me, you know we all saw it
You say I'm fake, that's your opinion, that's just y'all story
Just face the fact I was y'all blessin', but y'all ignored it
Your quest for fame had you distorted, not acceptin' sorry
I'm really that, the streets a vouch, the people vouch
The jail a vouch, all the niggas in the feds a vouch
We held it down while in the drought, one of my cells a vouch
I'm standing' out, when it's beef, I'm never standing' down

[Verse 1]
Stayed next door to Jermalo while in Saint John apartments
Couldn't afford the rent, we moved with grandma, more like an orphanage
The neighborhood ain't like us, say we came from New Orleans
Had some fights, I slung some iron in Baton Rouge, you recall it
Lee Lucas doing life, he left when I was 11
Had a job I did not like and started narcotic sellin'
I do it for me, I feed myself, fuck who not willin' to help me
We either die or go to jail, so what the fuck could you tell me?
Fully loaded MAC-11 when this pressure get applied
Got a brand new Glock 9 and I keep it by my side
You took the side of that lil' boy, done out of hatred, no question
Draw ya sword, get met with brute force, no second guessin' (up there)

Watch yo' mouth, no dissin' me, you know we all saw it

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Still honor Tommy Wraith for everything he did for me, I was loyal
Got betrayed, it came with great disapointment
I thought we was under that law but your nephew's an informant
Put the folks in my business, gotta set court appointments
Gotta suit up with lawyers, damn, this how we rockin'
They copyrighted my name and wanted 1 million dollars
The label laughed in my face, I had to pay out my pocket
Young Money closed the door and ain't nobody wanna sign me
Travis Newman looked out, we in the apartment, we grindin'
If you want 'em wholesale, just pull up and we got it
Shout out to Ms. Connie, my heart on Carolina
I put diamonds in the T-O-P and all in the bottom
I ain't never change up, let's get that understood
I'm in that 70805, they don't show love in my hood

I make a lot of music about the struggle
I don't mind goin' through the struggle
This just another one, ya heard me
(Say Kevin bruh, man what the fuck I'm hearin'?)
I will not be disrespected
(What's goin' on out there?)
Nigga or bitch
(Damn bruh you dropped the ball)
I know, I know, I know, I know
(Man you ain't representin' me)
I'ma shake back

[Verse 1]
Man in the mirror you way out of order
Go to jail who gonna look out for your daughter
All on the news bout what happened in Florida
Posted on Worldstar a iPhone recorded
She grabbed my dick overreacted, I'm sorry
Two or three times I had already warned her
Edit that part out, I don't Like to argue
My children go with me to every performance

[Interlude]
Wrong you should have respect for yourself
You a queen and you wasn't respectin' yourself
Ever been disrespected, you know how it felt
You don't have to like me go love someone else
[Verse 2]
Father forgive me I fucked up a blessin'
When ever I fall you the only one to catch me
Let's change the subject, I gave a confession
You put me back in it I bet I go extra

Wrong you should have respect for yourself
You a queen and you wasn't respectin' yourself
Ever been disrespected, you know how it felt
You don't have to like me go love someone else

SauceLord Rich way they got me feelin'
I don't get tired, I got ten jobs
I am Zuse bumpin' Lito when I'm chillin'
I'ma Breadwinner that is my religion
Don't comment on twitter let you know I meant it
I might like her picture
I'm like nigga really?
I'm like Bobby Fischer eat my competition
I'm ready to die, you gone have to kill me
With you right or wrong, don't believe in switchin'
Nasty from the shoulders watch how I switch positions
Put him in a blender my heart been December
Put him in a spitter, can't be reassembled
I'm a real nigga, really made mistakes
Never ran away, I am not pretendin'
High school back when I was at McKinley
I still fuck with Scooby, shout out to lil Brittney
Stayed with black guys, niggas always pickin' on a bright nigga
I am really with it
Damn my homeboy always in his feelin's
This ain't bout him, I'm just reminiscin'
He was crackin' jokes, always bein' silly
I was doin' me fuck a public image
Passionate I can be extra sometimes
Brasi turn back into Kevin sometimes
Ain't right in the head, look back up in jail
Lord don't let us get put back in the cell
Washin' clothes in the toilet water (Damn)
Drinkin' out the faucet had to use your hands
Gunna on the phone ""They got you lookin' bad""
For a punt return they gone run it back
Deal with it, Kevin stand up in they chest
This the same girl was pullin' out her breast
Got her mother lyin' tryna get a check
Remember who you are, they envy your success
Diamonds in your mouth all around your neck
Black and Hispanic the worst you could be
I think to myself they must hate Puerto Ricans
Father Moroccan my mother Boriqua
Daddy a Muslim, my mother a Christian
I read from the book, a lot I don't remember
Santeria beads Karma comes along
Now they want me gone like I'm Farrakhan
Praise you when you up, kick you when you fall
Throw you to the vultures, sniper pick you off
In a court of law brought you to the floor
All my young rappers they kept it one million
Learn from my misfortune don't get in your feelin's
Be an individual you go to prison
I just took a stand with my saggin' pants
I just tell the truth like I'm Jesus Christ
Meant to say Jesus
I'm who they don't like
I'ma move around I don't like the vibe

God up in heaven you know that I need you
To the polices just make me invisible

Cheatin', multiple women, I can't keep no account (Keep no account)
Takin' care of multiple women out of separate accounts
Every time I sat in the cell, you sent whatever amount
Spendin' millions on lawyers, tryna help me get out
Met when we was seventeen, you was a virgin
What I did broke your spirit, got our daughter murdered (Huh), huh
Loving shit that wasn't never worthy
Subconsciously tryna tear down what you helped me build on purpose, but you stayed solid
Makin' you look stupid in the streets, but you stayed by me
Hoes say this and that, you never speak, you stayed silent
Sometimes I just sit alone and think
Couldn't take it if the shit I did was ever done to me
Women keep they business real discreet, and they stay smilin'
We healin' now, huh (We healin' now)
Caught a body, came and hid with you on LSU campus
Operatin' off batteries, do somethin', I smashed 'em
Swear to God from this day forward it's 'bout makin' you happy
We healin' now
Askin' God to cleanse my scars and turn my pain into passion
Forgave myself for past mistakes, I'm not afraid to look backwards
I see us when we were children when my children look at me
Know there's gotta be a God 'cause He protected my family

I'm your fantasy, don't fall in love with me, I break hearts
But I'm genuine, one must admit I got a great heart

[Verse 1]
Makin' calls to the plug (hello?)
I'm tryna ball, goin' hard, I'm not ballin' enough (score)
I got scars on my heart, come from fallin' in love (don't fall)
On my knees every night placin' calls up above
Seems like God won't pick up
If Heaven won't show me a way (show me the way)
Guide me when I grip the weight
'Cause in the city we livin' in
It's kill or you gettin' killed
I was taught to keep it real
Misguided in the field (come here)
Boom boom pop bang bang
Forgive me I done gripped the steel (woo)
She the devil, she was bad, long weave, buku ass
Round enough, make pretty faces when I'm hittin' her from the back
And I got caught and I ain't rat, some buku guys she ain't hit back
I done been to hell and back, 'cause I done been to jail and back

[Verse 2]
Makin' calls to the plug, I fell off then got up
I'm standin' tall no matter what, real nigga never budge
Thinkin' y'all shall not judge while I stood in front the judge
Media, they tellin' lies about me, that don't matter much
I'm not turnin' up
I just got back from the future, don't know what I'm speakin' of
I'm not turnin' up
Leave you leakin' just for reachin', ain't no drinkin' out my cup
Shawty yellow, aw yeah, slim, she Barbie Doll bad
She got pregnant from my partner so I had to fall back
She was with another rapper, hold up, I can't talk that
Text her when she call back, if I ain't a dick slanger tell me what you call that

[Intro]
I had figured it out what it be
See a nigga just do something pussy because they just won't see
They just won't see as if, you know, I'm in a real thing
Awesome awesome
Really don't even call me Kevin no more, call me awesome, call me awesome

[Verse 1]
Exit off Highland, headed to the bottom
There go them dicks, (I see em') just watch em'
Make a left on East Buchanan, pull up in a backyard on Carolina
Me and Lil Ra-Ra, we juug in the city, at night I lick on her vagina
Shakira ain't want me to fuck with Sharita, backdoor Vicky with Dewana
Trappin' a package, I wrap it, get at me
When Dominique pull up, I serve, he leave happy
Shout out to Spanky, we floodin' the drought
We on College at IHoP and Cherish can't stand me
My pants is saggin' with 'bout 30 bands
Masquerade in New Orleans when I spotted Jasmine
Cedar pull up in Atlanta with Bizzy
That's Bread Winner business, that's Boobie and Menace
They land and say ""Stand up"" and eat niggas' chests
RIP Reezy, uptown in my section
Fear of Allah and all praise be to God
Be my only protection whenever I'm steppin'
Callin' out to the Creator
That Aramis will come up from under whatever
In the cell I can see all the pain in his eyes
And I wish I had somethin' to tell him
[Hook]
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up
Think about respectin', everything I said, I meant it
Racin' modification on the Maserati engine
Pull up on the block, my bad, I'm sorry y'all hatin'
Shittin' ordinary life, fuck all of y'all lately
Gazin' out the sunroof, wonder why she not performin'
This bitch don't wanna eat my dick, I told his ho don't bother
Pull over, kick her out the car, won't even tell her sorry
It's a long walk back to B.R. while in Georgia

[Verse 2]
Awesome, we almost home
And them niggas you fuckin' with don't do no sparkin'
Don't do no talkin', I will not ever see death
Listen carefully, nigga, I'm flawless
Illuminated by the high-power
Enlightened but walk in the darkness
Cast not your pearls to the swine, young nigga
Remembering what I had taught you
I am outweighing a truth and a lie
And I've been up 40 days on a flight
Overcooked dope with a grayish complexion
When it first hit the pot it was white
My oldest son lil' Tyler
Every time he 'round me he smilin'
And he know his daddy would turn this bitch to Afghanistan
No problem
[Hook]
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up
And I'm married to my hustle, makin' love
And ain't nothin' in this world could break us up

Gazin' out the sunroof, wonder why she not performin'
This bitch don't wanna eat my dick, I told his ho don't bother
Pull over, kick her out the car, won't even tell her sorry
It's a long walk back to B.R.O. while in Georgia

[Outro]
I had really did that, nigga thought I was stuntin'
The bitch ain't want bless me, ya heard me?
I told her ""Look bae, go get that out the trunk for me?""
You know, soon as she went and got it, you know
She forgot the Aston Martin had the automatic close button
SKRRRRRRT, BROOM
And it wasn't my whip, it was a rent I'ma keep it one thousand
You heard me? (Laughing)

I got a heart that's full of love
With so much love to give
But I'm saying though, I feel how you feel
Where we go from here?
I got a heart that's full of love
With so much love to give
Look, I ain't never been too hard for myself

[Chorus]
I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers
When you're in love who gives a fuck about an Audemar
When the lights go down and you're looking around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you

[Verse 1]
She's a murderer, when I hurt it aches
She has an hourglass figure and a perfect waist
Breaking my feelings she contributes to the murder rate
I went to jail she dreamt it, from the symptoms I have no escape
This no facade Peter tange in my cigar
The way I move may be peculiar to people I come across
Stress, this confession forever you in my heart
Wish you the best, in whatever endeavors that you embark
Gates
I got a heart that's full of love with so much love to give
I often pictured us together married with some kids
Victim of a broken promise I know what it is
And all of your friends know I'm a gangster
[Bridge]
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
Wishing I was there to lay onside of you at night
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
I pray that heaven comforts you, so you should be alright, alright

[Chorus]
I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers
When you're in love who gives a fuck about an Audemar
When the lights go down and you're looking around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you (whoa, whoa, whoa)
Alleviate your clothes and make your body turn around
Now you're asking yourself, who's gonna love you

[Verse 2]
Making fake moves backwards (what that is), fatal attraction
I'll forever be your slave, I been caged in and captured
And the drugs don't really make the problem ever shrink
But they do release the endorphins that help me not to think
Suicide's been contemplated irrational way of thinking
Attach a brick to my ankle and throw me over the deep end
Weekend, sleep in, I don't go to clubs
Ask me any question and I might respond with shoulder shrugs
Connected for eternity when forces take control of us
Luca Brasi get it in, you should know what's up
Do this every time I'm the life of the party
Know its got a name but they don't know what to call me
[Bridge]
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
Wishing I was there to lay onside of you at night
Can't you tell it's obvious I live a fly life?
I pray that heaven comforts you, so you should be alright, alright

[Chorus]
I got a stupid house that's empty when I'm out on leers
When you're in love who gives a fuck about an Audemar

[Hook]
Hate the way I'm feelin', pain killers in the cup
Pray to God I wanna end it, seems I don't believe in much

[Verse 1]
Nobody did nothin' for me when I’m on my knuckles
Quick to tell a nigga fuck 'em, I come up from nothin'
Bad dreams, heart cold, sick of lookin' out
Best niggas slow to major and they lookin' frowned
Goin' shoppin', buyin' belts, even help them out
You was not real nigga, you dependin' if your loyalty is bought
It's sold to the highest bidder
Block bitch niggas number never reconsider
I was born a god but I finally got the picture
Couldn't mingle with the peasants, you too good for that, you different
Smilin' in your face, they see you stumble, they'll kick you
Work hard, trap by myself, I don't kick it
Turn my nose up, sick of fuckin' with you bitches

Now I'm givin' up, suicide been contemplated, think I really had enough
I think I really had enough
Wanna believe all the lies that they told me, that they told me
Wanna believe all the lies that they told me, that they told me

[Verse 2]
We share the same cell, help them bond out we play the game well, I'm confused by the news
I don't pick and choose
Everyday ready for death, nigga win or lose
Brains blowed out, I'm still goin' to court
Rest in peace Gangster Reezy, I miss ya, swear to God
Marquise got murdered two weeks after we talked
That other boy pussy, he lyin', we never fought
Scared of a nigga, the yard he never walked
Caught him in the chow hall round the free people
Locker full of shit, nigga I can feed people
Penitentiary rich, got phones in the line
BWA, I was strong in the mind
Dreka come and visit got richer just let it pile
Julio I miss you, just hit me when you get out
Free throw shot to Kyrie right on consignment could get him out
I don't want to touch 'em, test somethin' nigga, we swap it out
Bullet after bullet after bullet after bullet
Walked down out the cut stand up in your chest
Rubber band up, never seen it, I'm a skeptic
Ya'll praise a bitch nigga but I still ain't get it yet

Got my Vans in advance
Acting bad on them tabs
Pants cost a grand
Put that ass in my hands
Duffel bag full of cash
She a model? I'mma get her
Seen 'em now
She stop, popped, and squat by the zipper
Thinking out loud
My dick probably trynna kill her
Helpin' somebody
The bitch wiped off the liqour
Going live
Long hair, shawty ride like Geronimo
Sayin' I got the gas
I ain't talkin' 'bout Conoco
Knock the whole click down
I'm talking like dominoes
One hit wonder
When we finish, adios

Take her backseat watch this
It's Holiday Season, bitch
Money count don't stop
Foreign cars, bad bitches
Suitcase full of money
(Holiday Season)
Nigga I don't get tired

Money really make me feel like I could be somebody
When I pull up in that Benz, beaucoup freaks surround me
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny
Money comin' to me ridin' round with duffel bags
Stacks of dirty money wrapped in beaucoup rubber bands
I was born with a plug who am I to lie
You know I let them fly like Puerto Rican Johnny

[Verse 1]
My bitch is Tahoe, this whip came equipped with Moscato
My driver be drivin' me around
Gunner and Boobie, my clique full of shooters look stupid
They sendin' them rounds
While I'm in bounds, awkwardly I got an ounce
Groupies be followin' me around
Want me the take off the rubbers, you dummy it's nothin'
You fuck with a few of my rounds
Britches ain't baggy, but my pants are saggin'
This Five Panel hat and I just turned it backwards
Somewhat eclectic I don't fuck with rappers
I'm not into swaggin' but they love my swagger
Your bitch is an animal, fuck from the back
And it's somewhat degradin' the way I behave with her
Want me to stay with her, I could just play with her hard
On her feelings won't kiss her, won't lay with her
[Pre-Hook]
Bitch I got paper to get
If I'm broke then I'd probably end up unhappy
I'm a ceramic, pull up on carbon ceramics
My bitch didn't deliver a package
The label has sued me, it threatened to take me to court
And you know we look at it like rattin'
They got in front of a song for like 8 minutes long
But that shit wasn't even effective

Caught money givin' orders to a bitch, excuse me?

And the people that I own it check, now nigga come get it how you live
Put that on the RIP, Rest in Peace to my nigga Weep got a feelin' that I'm on a muthafuckin' wig
Carve a pussy not at all a pussy, would it bother you or can I call you pussy?
On the phone with a bitch I can call for pussy, I ain't feed her no dick Im'ma starve the pussy

Smilin' in my face, but itchin' to get me wacked
Name in his mouth bad when he kick it wit' other camps
Tellin' lies wit' the stamp and try to give me the wrap
I'm in the street wit' it, you really won't be exact
Not a good gang member, the members'll probably rat
I don't trust many proficient at livin' that
I don't love women, I hit, you could get her back
Hang up in his face, watch how quick he call back
Whip up at the Texaco, now, what you call that?
You in the paint, now I get in wit' you, I’m wit' all that
Shoulder strap wit' a suppressor, MAC-11, fall back
Speakers bumpin' Omelly 'Osama Twin Lammas'
Grew up seein' violence, pull up, what's the knowledge?
Got my GED, wish I would have made it to college
Wishin' you was free, I could picture you right on 'side me
If I love you, go to war over nothin' if it's a problem
Diamonds in the T-O-P, diamonds in the bottom
Gold mouth dog, self-made, I'm a grinder
Stack paper, hit your girl later, it's a Friday
You know I got a lot of record labels tryin' to sign me
They say if I'm a risk, it's detrimental to the profit
Beyoncé follow me on Instagram, Jigga, watch it
Younger sister, tell her, 'Not interested', she a bopper
Healthy kid, Kodak Black, smokin' that broccoli

Everybody sleepin' on me, finally got it poppin'
Wishin' I was wit' my children watchin' Mary Poppins
101 Dalmatians, smokin' grass while I'm on my island
Gettin' tattooed in my kitchen, okay 'iego wit' the heater there
Ghetto, I be strollin' 'round wit' smokers, I ain't even there
Right around the corner, got it jumpin', you could meet me there
That bad news, they was talkin' 'bout already beat me there
Comin' home to my apartment, findin' my daughter dead
Then we put his kid in the oven, so now his daughter dead
Not a robbery, this a murder, woke the whole house
I don't go to funerals, but lean be gettin' poured out
Group home in Lake Charles, turn up, turn up, wait, pause
Atlanta wit' the cartel microwave, boy

What up with Big Tony, mafia material
Hand signal, shoutin' out the plug in the interview

Scratch the dealers, now we go and get 'em in the inner tube
Breakin' down, distribute, my fingers steady itchin'
Y'all shootin' videos where they 'posed want to kill me

Failure to comply, most likely might have to force you
Blow your brains out, the body bag or the coffin
Me and mi carnal in the Jag sippin' coffee
We don't get harassed by the badge where the warrant?
Never been a confidential witness, not informant
Trappin' out the shop, why you findin' this alarmin'?

You tall and you can't dress, really, you annoyin'
Lil' mama better get wit' me before I'm out of range
Right, they got him dumb, they kinda put me in the game
Me and Dreka dealin' wit' the green, that's the only play

Look in the mirror, what do you see?
I see someone dealin' with heartbreak
When I love a nigga, my heartache
I know how a Cuban cigar taste
But that do not help with the heart pain
My lil' brother died in a car chase
And spent on my older brother from beside the whip
He got the car sprayed
Guess he got through on the crossway
Thankful that we ever crossed ways (Allahu Akbar)
Wonder do heaven got hallways? (Allahu Akbar)
Prayin' how much I say always
Salute OG Boobie, that's all day
Bringin' it back from the causeway
Ain't fuckin' with niggas, they all fake
Was up on my end and they all hate
You can’t get mad at a nigga who’s gettin' it
If he not carryin’ y'all weight
I had to make a decision
Bread Winner mission to get it while y'all wait
I get that coffee delivered
Metric ton off the boat in a tall crate
Maybe I'm havin’ an off day
Maybe I had a heart and my heart changed

Of somebody killin' me, tryna get rid of me

You gotta finish me right there
Mazi was smiling when somebody shot him, diamonds on heaven in the night air
Lemme me breathe for a minute
I mean, did a nigga not think this day would come?
I mean from Allah we come
To Allah we must return
I pour a four in a two liter
And remember some joy and we all well
I put a ho in a two-seater
I press on the floor and the car bail
Runnin' the raw like a Barksdale
Dump through the miles with the cartel
Sell you a dog with a small tail
Low to the ground wit' a large head
The ho that you lovin', she garbage
I'ma go vroom in a Corvette
Take your shoes off in the apartment
We could go sit on the carpet
Look, I made you some tea, she got all wet
But I am not fallin' for all that
I hit from the back and she ""Aw yea!""
Now you gotta leave and don't call back
I hit from the back and ""Aw Yeaa!""
Now you gotta leave and don't call back
Only the player shit I entertain
I done matured, I was bein' lame
I had some cuts turned into stains
You know I'm still prayin' for Lil' Flame
I'm still affiliated with the game
Bread Winner Gang (Bread Winner Gang)
Cop lights, no lookin' around at the stop light
These niggas be actin' they not right and only security top flight
It might went over your head a lil' bit but it come off of Friday with Mike Epps
Smokin' a clip with a nice hep
We tryna celebrate another season
I'm tryna levitate it out of reachin'
I'm tryna meditate you with my breathin'
I'm tryna better ways from livin' decent
I'm on some medication, got me thinkin'
I roll a cigarillo with Sativa

[Verse 1]
Out in California recording (what the fuck, man a text message look)
Kevin it started, iPhone on FaceTime this is important
Home birth, this a first Dricka having my daughter
Watching on a iPhone, thought that it was a boy
Thinking I gotta get home, catch a flight to New Orleans
Gotta pick up my car, I gotta drive to Atlanta
In that order (for real)
Me and Percylago on the highway (what up nigga)
On that water, only stopping for gas
Back my Porsche in the garage, up the stairway I'm charging
And she ain't open her eyes until she heard me talkin'

[Talking]
I can’t explain the feeling thug, shit was crazy, she was born November 30th, you know a nigga thought she wasn’t gonna be here till Christmas

[Verse 2]
Already missed a birth of one, maxi plate when he do
Back in Baton Rouge, for a video shoot, fee and Didra blowing up my phone, prolly all day long, I got to much going on (I'm right down the street)
Everything going wrong, in the back of my mind like what the fuck do they want, from me
I'm only one man and it's hard to operate when it ain't no sleep
It's hard to operate when it ain't no sleep
Women's hospital, where she was admitted
Supposed to be there for twelve baby due in a minute, experience complication, baby no longer kicking
Perform a c-section, doctors gotta go in and get it
But that's alright I held her tight, while under operating lights, umbilical cord wrapped around his neck, he came out and was fine
Surgeon wiped him off and passed him, I grabbed him, he had me worried out my mind, praying on my line
Satellites video finished right back to the grind, it's a movie
My life a movie, it's a movie
I don't like to do no acting but I know my life could be a fucking movie
[Kevin gates talking]
And he was born like December the 18th, I think, he be mad at me if I'm wrong
But I'm thinking, I'm pretty sure it was December the 18th
Big long ass nigga too, that motherfucker bout that long
You looking like you can really see what I'm talkin' bout

[Sings]
Lil Eazy you don't understand bruh the lil bitch was bout this long thug

[Talks]
I was visiting my nigga through videos, when I hold him my arms short, fingers show em how long he was
Lil bitch dick long and everything you retawdid (I seen that, just like his daddy)
I love you too nigga, you need to hurry and bring ya pussy ass home, you know wassup, come outchea

I just don't know what

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I hurt so much in the last month
Live everyday like it's your last one
Can't trust nobody
I've been betrayed by everybody around
Cracking jokes I don't laugh much
For help I never could ask much
If im down an out i get passed up
No one there to be found
This life is like a rodeo
Up and down emotional roller coaster
Problem solving ain't hard to cope with
But it's hard to follow rules, I'm the culprit
Easy to talk but its hard to listen
But the goal I'm chasing ain't hard to picture
Hurt to see every car I wanted
But behind the wheel I ain't the person in it
The chick I wanted, wanted someone popular
And I ain't that popular (whats that?)
But now im so high, you gon' need binoculars
Now there ain't nothing i .......
Bunk bed living had to sleep on top one another
Theres nothing you could do for me
Made it from the bottom to the top
Can't stop my grind, really out my mind - True Story!

Lemme keep this shit 100

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
I'm so pressured out to win
Enough to make anyone consider the normal clique
Flashing out having arguments
Im no longer in bounds
What meets the surface ain't all you get
Introverts can't be too talkative
Now as my heart place all of it
Usually I wear frowns
Ain't no sense in my straight pretending
In a room full of people, I pays attention
Steak for dinner, that we provided
Made money in the slum that the street provided
Behind my door
Clutch heat beside it
Out of line, I was taught let it eat somebody
Put the sleeper silence
Retreat from by me
If it ain't no profit, you should leave from buying it
Certain things about it won't change
The world ain't able to see bout that
My pants they sagging below my waist
Pockets filled with Franks
Say I'm wylin out ways
Love the game, never back out
Cold but is fair, and its fair but it's cold
Sold not told, nigga trap out
[Bridge]
Lemme keep this shit 100
I don't know your name
You don't know my name
And thats the way i want it

252 on the digi’, I'm still in the kitchen
I’m cookin' a four and a half
Pyrex to yola, I add a lil' soda
It bubble, I double to five hundred grams
My junkie a tester, say, ""How may I help you?""
I blessed him, I guess he just need a lil' blast
Not a good looker, but she a good hooker
And I’m 'bout to turn me some trash into cash
Water just gushed out her mouth and her pussy
She need some more cushion, went bought her some ass
Secret compartment, Toyota Corolla
I'm hopin' the load don't get caught on the slab
Nothing impossible, had a few obstacles
Right back to clocking like I never left
My windows is tinted
My mouth and my watch go to hitting while grippin' the wheel in my 'Vette
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm in two lanes, whip is insane, I had to take off the brain

I got my shirt off, dropping the work off
On Carolina controlling the spot
12 in the section, harassing pedestrians
Catching a sale, they patrolling, it's hot
If I get arrested, my bail could be set at whatever
Go right back and open up shop
Emit The Jeweler come sit in my section
It look like Lil' Kevin wrist flooded with rocks
I cut on the faucet, I'm really retarded
I bought a lil' water, not spillin' a drop
You gotta be cautious, I'm clutching
You cross me, this pump put a permanent scar in your top
Bought a new Frenchie, she got a big head like Rihanna
It's cute, I'm not takin' a shot
Designer my closet, pick up a deposit
On Michigan Ave when I chill in the Chi

Would I be wrong? I wanna fuck you with one of my niggas
If afterwards I promise that I wouldn't look at you different
Broke down some buds of grigy empty my gut and twist it
Settle down, it's 'bout to get explicit
Passed you the light, you lit it, inhale, you (cough), I get it
Love the way you look at me, especially when you're lifted
This is bound to be a wild ride
Wild ride, wild ride
Pussy drippin', yeah we callin' off, nigga
Hit you from behind, ass up and face down
And I live everything I'm sayin', babe this ain't no make believe

[Verse 1]
Fresh, we started
Existence on a higher plane, mentally we orbits
Stimulated my prognosis is that we proceed with caution
Dick woah, stroke her slow, feelings caught us, now we're caught in
Bread winner's my religion, these dealings are detrimental
God blessed me with a pivotive intimate, then I'm off it
Sippin' coffee, havin' money, ain't into flossin'
'Telligent conversation, conversin', sorry you lost me
I'm awesome, broke down bricks, cocaine powder, sniff
Gently placin' kisses against her clit, dick got her whipped
She'll pleasure, yeah we fuck her together, pussy to shit
Participate or stallin', won't even call 'em, I let 'em sit
Purchase bae some purses, respect a slut, we takin' trips
Sometimes I like to watch my ho fuck, video makin' flicks
In the whip jackin' me off, know how to make it spit
Hand in my drawers, fondle my balls, she got the softest grip

[Verse 2]
Let's plan a visit overseas
Spontaneous the way I do my shit, you wouldn't believe
Rip out in the kitchen then I fuck her on her knees
Make her eat my dick in front of her friend before I leave
Bae you got these niggas jealous, steady wishin' they was me
I turned up for a check and got some money off the streets
Backseat of the Jag cut up for everyone to see
Hit the club next to me in my section in VIP
Eat the pussy from the back and I don't give a fuck who lookin'
Might not notice but I'm strapped, bitch act a ass, I gotta cook em'
Under the light she dance for me, body movin' slow
Break bread, fingernails pedicured, the polish glow
My bitch look like a tiger, I call her type exotic
Swallow from the bottle, point at what I want, she holler
Tongue between her asscheeks, steam all in the shower
Down for whatever, whatever, Bonnie and Clyde her
Got her

Been through the stack, I get rack on a rack, I keep thumbin' and thumbin'
I did a show, caught a case on that road, I ain't runnin' from nothin'
God on my side, I got nothin' to hide, now I'm runnin' from nothin'

Sat me down, broke me down, said make me proud (said make me proud)
I came up, I rose up out the mud
Can't trust nobody so in God I trust

[Verse 1]
I'm a grinder, oh ooh oh oh oh
You got the number one song on the radio and you still gotta sit in jail?
I went and laid, I'm in the top rack by the lake
I'ma sleep all day and be up late
I had to make the best of what I had
I'm in the trap spot with the bangs
Fuckin' a bad bitch with the brain
Double the carats, get the rings
Standin' on all ten in the game
Just say went all in the paint
Happen to merc and I'm thinkin' 'bout Menace
Thinkin' 'bout Gunna, new daughter, delivered
Thinkin' 'bout havin' a car in the city
Under the tint, she be showin' her titties
There was a time when my name would get mentioned
Hard to think fly when your pockets is empty
Bentley pull up, we gon' drop in there, simply
I'ma work out and go hard it's just in me
Cardiovascular, cardio fitness
Get outta pocket, we deal with it quickly
Lovin' a snake, turned around and it bit me right in the kidney

Hey, I'ma make mistakes in life
Yes sir
I'm not perfect, ya heard me? (I'm not perfect)
You know, don't judge me 'cause I don't judge

[Verse 2]
Ain't been to no funerals lately, my partners, they dead or in jail
I fought the pain for a long time, I tried alot and I failed
But now it's time to excel, they come on a metric ton scale
Say hold on to the guardrail, flyin' outta here
From takin' a trip to supply to takin' a trip to Dubai
I done been shitted on by a lotta rappers and it don't at all matter
The ones that fuck with me know I'm one-thousand, they know I'm all action
I'm a big general, I could send a load and I'm bread winner active
I could cook off the pot or a base, fishscale I could lock
Re-compress, five ton in a box
Guerilla hustle, I done been on the block

Phil never jacked me, what you talkin’ 'bout
Bought a two and a quarter, in the middle of  drought
And lost fourteen grams and he swap me out
Ain’t nothing else to really talk about
I’m the one you get the green from
I used to front it when you need somethin’
I move bail, fat lips and leeches

Used to mean somethin’ [it really did]
Now it means nothing [at all]

Tatted your name, now I do know who you is
If I had to I would do it again
My partner died but on my arm he still lives
I wear my heart on my skin, can't forget where I been

Beautiful scars
On my back and all
You see how far I come
You gave me scars
Beautiful scars
I'm out here going hard
My nigga fuck with y'allEmbed"

Come up through the struggle  not too many get to tell
Got up and shook it off every time we ever failed
(Why do we fall? So we can  learn how to pick ourselves back up)
Transportation make you happy when your life’s a living hell
Sirens jump behind us, praying we don't go to jail

[Verse]
Window skimp, two attempts, handing bands over
Seeko hit, shot and missed 2 then stand over him
Bread Winner, huh? Look who in the building
Let me check my Instagram I might be at a million
Pissed on, you out ya mind, I'm out mine
Better not flinch wrong
I’m on my grind, rock supplying like the Flintstones
Reputation on the line and the clips long
They 9 to 5, slangin' nine you get blitzed on (Bitch I want the only driver, Luca Brasi)
Bitch I'm papered up
Diamonds glistening, rocking feelings, I ain’t tapered up
Get on your shit, get out your feelings, hatin’ fake as fuck
Some feel I’m trippin’ how I’m livin’ I can’t change it up
I’m a praying mane droppin’ change case spray shit up!
Might just be me I’m in the strippers ain't no breaking up
She talking reckless, bitch whatever phone I’m hanging up
Dick so good can’t seem to keep this bitch away from us
And me and Nook will fuck your bitch she wasn't made to love
Phone ringing while in a meeting that’s my dog calling
Won’t point a finger, give an order and they all stalking
Speech muted, pressing pause no longer hearing voices
Became a boss, couple cars I got steering choices
Said I was crazy, wasn't goin be shit back in elementary
Bitches on my dick, fresh steppin out McKinley
Hoop dreams never had em, tryna to fetch a chicken
Say its gangsta, there go Lump hanging out the window
Trying to rob me I got shot, two weeks he expired
Nigga burnt ya truck, what up? Ain’t nobody die
Lil bright nigga came thru spitting, wasn't no dumping back
D Dub got off,then got ripped up, you ain't fuck with that
We on our knees praying daily God brung him back
Putting cookies in my daddy head, a fuckin rat
My daddy don't wanna sell me nun, Nook done brung the pack
Bone turned me up (??)
Stroke got hit while he was with me now we clutching bad
And we riding round the bottom with a bunch of strap
[Outro]
Mane we pull up on Buck, ya heard me
Me and Stroke in the car, ya heard me
I got the MAC-11 with the whisper thing on that bitch
You call my phone talking bout, ""Mane what you doin' out?""

And if I look in your direction
I'm just looking, you not special
I got partners who got pressure
We just fucked your ho together
Drop the numbers on the brick
I brought the load in with no effort
I just flew to Mexi', Cali, I won't be home in a month

Somebody take a picture to the jail, I'm 'bout to mail out
Upright, independent feelings, I don't care 'bout what you care 'bout
Gotta focus on my children, when I can, I try to help out
Some people feeling left out, I'm grinding all last year
If you know me then you know 'bout my year before that year
I was locked behind the fence being discriminated against
Now I got entertainment, women wanna be intimate with the kid
Wanna be intimate with the kid
I been workin' out on my heart, I'm trying diligently to forget
Then remember what you did
It's been difficult for to forgive
Finally, I understand it
We come from two different planets
Keeping it platinum so demanding

Say I'm too aggressive, that's that pressure, nigga, test you
Shout my nigga Special, he come home we goin' extra
Evolvin', grew with power, he that sour, I'mma stretch you
My heart too big while thankin' God, I finally learned my lesson
Your bitch gon' fuck someone you know after you get arrested
My nigga broke the street law with a 8 minute confession
God have mercy on his soul, pray he don't miss no blessings
Turnin' up with Killa all on Instagram we flexin'
I'll step one of you niggas, check one of you niggas
Get pissed on, get pissed off and bless one of you niggas
But wait, that's Lil' Kevin, loaded MAC-11
Tell the ho you're with that you'll disrespect me
But probably really won't ever
I run shit, no effort, walk by faith, I'm careless
No weapon formed shall prosper, I'm a god, nigga, be careful
Nigga slapped you, you ain't die 'bout it
So pussy nigga, whatever
When it's shots fired, I was outchea
Still ridin' 'round in my section
Heaven made me tailor-made, express image and likeness
Illuminated, my skin glow and a lot of niggas don't like it
Immortal, swearin' to me when they swearin' to God
They won't wake up tomorrow
Angels will follow, speak death from my lips
And I promise you this, you will lay in a coffin
Dominion over this outer realm, mojo power like Austin
Starbucks with K. Michelle, in the car sippin' my coffee
I meant to say Kara Michelle, excuse me if I had lost you
If a bitch bad with a thick ass, whip dick out while she talkin'
If we in the car and she get mad, won't kiss ass, she walkin'
My new thing I just grabbed, cocaine paint retarded
Nother wrapped dash with wood grain and the lamb skin like Spalding
Chris Porter at Auburn, Menace pickin' up when I called 'em
At the barbershop, a nigga feel he had me uncomfortable I won't argue
You ain't know Nook was in the back room
Go with your move, he gon' off ya
That same nigga that said I look at him like a big uncle
Hate you the most be the people that love you

Kevin Gates: I ain’t gon' lie I be gettin' a lil emotional
Go ahead, record it all
I be gettin a lil emotional when I be doing this but
It’s just him with that camera that shit that be throwing me off
Ready? Start it off?

Person 1: You go

Kevin Gates: You ain’t gotta leave out, it’s just I know I’m on film, you heard me?

Person 2: No you’re good

Kevin Gates: So it fuck with me a lil bit
You ain’t gotta go nowhere though you can sit down and stay
It’s a true story
And I ain't gon' forget my words; start it off

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
I was chilling in the IHOP overheard a conversation
Both of them niggas killers one of them was Michael Caden
Big brother to Jason I went to school with him
His brother got killed so now he keep a tool with him
Live around the corner from his 2 daughters, no father
That’s when the waitress came over like may I take your order
Give me the breakfast sample, orange juice, and a coke
That nigga looked at me and nodded his head I never spoke
Like what the fuck them niggas looking at that’s what I heard the other say
Looked at me mean mugging wait
Nigga turn the other way
I had to turn deaf ears, Satan was in my left ear
Like go and cancel you a nigga nobody can see you
Show them niggas that you real nobody could be you
I walked over and asked him you want to take it off your shoulder?
Hand checking him in his face telling him I’m a soldier
I ain’t no fuckin drug lord I ain’t the type to try to be
10 years of aggression you don’t want to see that out of me
Jagged Edge Smith & Wesson banging singin I gotta be, that nigga
That nigga, It all started on a Tuesday afternoon me and my bitch got into it
Unnecessary foolishness 2 and half ruined
Found out from another chick living out of town
In a upstairs apartment that was 3 corners down
Clip spot for my rounds
Jeff used to score pounds
Tanya ran it to me how Amber had ran into me
Me and Tanya remain cool Amber man was pussy
He ran to the block and check some niggas from another hood
They came back and black masked up just like I knew they would
Running out there bucking loud niggas all will laugh at ya
Hard not to bang when you got bitch niggas attacking ya
Up the forty caliber on coming passenger
Scuffle through the tourist section stole on a trafficker
Seen him with his clique he used to mug, but never bucked with them
Used to keep a smirk because my old lady was fucking him
Ain’t no need to get mad I’m thinking I ain’t never fuck with him
Hit one of my niggas up we bargained on his brain
Fucking with my lil brother who frequently snorted cain
Dapped him down as I pass him was heading to where he twerked him
Back was turned the whole time lil brother ran up and murked him
Issued him two to the dome and worked him with the chrome
Till this day I can say I set him up and he gone
[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
3 months prior I’m downtown meeting Lisa McBoyd
I’m in town handling business for Floyd he couldn’t make it
I'mma take it by myself I'm awaiting a vacation
3 bricks going to Kurt coming home from Las Vegas
On the phone with Joe finishing a conversation
His cell was gon be off cause he was at a graduation
But shit, I’m on my way out a state to meet Mason
He told me to be safe and any problems I can page him
Jeff sitting patient in a vacant location
Not knowing that we was stopping in another metropolitan
Tanya text Jeff still waiting replied obviously
Hope your cousin Kevin ain’t fake and he ain’t jiving me
Or trying to get me up to the 'jects plotting on robbing me
Tanya said Kevin my cousin he wouldn’t lie to me
Whenever y’all had talked he was right here on the side of me
They into real estate and probably looking at property

Helping papi crush the coca leaves
That was way before machines
Used to love visiting the villa
Making noise praying no one hear us
Goddamn i dont wanna leave
Damn i dont wanna leave..
You mi caramelito
And I gotta ship the perico
Dinero in Norteamérica
And I gotta get it back overseas
And I gotta get it back overseas
Dinero in Norteamérica
And I gotta get it back overseas
[Chorus]
How you get all that in a pair of jeans?
Girl you some action I've never seen
Girl you some action I've never seen
How you get all that in a pair of jeans?
And I just wanna take you home and lay you down
And I just wanna take you home and lay you down
And I used to deal with your padre, a long time ago
Since then I moved on, but I still deal dope
Takin' trips out to Bogota, I used to catch hard sales
I was in love with your madre comida
Now I got my own cartel

[Verse 3]
Run it up, bein' broke a bad dream
Fast car with the NASCAR seats
Jaguar with the all black feet
Z06 spillin' Act on me
Hit the mall, I run out of shit to buy
Ball, got a lot of shit that I supply
Lick mine then you know I gotta ride
Bitch that I'm with, she won't even visit
I ain't even trippin', fuck her, she can die
Dyin' inside, thinkin' homicide
Bye, cold world I hate to be alive
Letters, I am contemplatin' suicide
Say I'm keepin' this between you and I
Wanna make love, she ain't got the time
Always in her feelings, blamin' it on business
I just got a mistress, fuck her intuition
I want you to know I'm lovin' somethin' else
I want you to know I'm lovin' someone else
I want you to know I'm fuckin' in your bed
I hope what I wrote be fuckin' with your head
[Outro]
You should have tried to hold on to me
Don't ever let me go
Don't ever let me go
You should have tried to hold on to me
Don't ever let me go
Don't ever let me go
You gon' miss me one day

Til' the paddywagon pull up and cuff us
My pants saggin', I'm double cup
Southside, hustle inside, hustle outside, I don't give a fuck
I might beam ya up, you won't get it up
You wanna shoot dice, we could do somethin'
In the club with like 30 bands, going hard til' like 2 somethin'
Go live on em, hit vibes on em
Niggas lie bout it, I'm fly on em
My lil' niggas, on my corner, they rap too, they trap too
Pull up broad day, you know the raw way
With the rod play, bap-ap you
Lil' Mocha said and Dearcy, Beeto and Brian just called me
Uptown Beezy, lil' Jeremy nook in my brother sprite no talkin'
Bring yappas out, pass by your house, December feelin' like August
Pullin' up on murder street, my uncles clutchin' revolvers
Hear anything about ?'s green, you play with that, I'm gon' off ya
20 years in, rap hustlin', got in the game I'm hawkin'
Audemars, I'm ballin', bitch you love, I'm doggin'
Last old lady, took my feelings like Soulja Slim, no fallin'
She thinking she special, paid her, told her get to stepping, retawdid'!

[Chorus]
I ain't got shit to do but cook like I was from Virginia
These niggas lyin' in they rhymes, you could stop pretending
My pants saggin' in this bitch, don't give a fuck who feel me
And if you disrespect me nigga, you gon' have to kill me
Bitch, I'mma die bout it
Nigga, I'mma die bout it
I'm from where niggas get it on
We don't cry bout it
You say a nigga disrespect you, nigga ride bout it
I know some pussy niggas scared, probably hide bout it
[Verse 2:]
Faggot throwing water at the event at my show
Catch him on the rebound I wanna see if could catch what I throw
Look 20, bands, 30, bands, 40, bands, 50, bands
Get 'em captured, get 'em splattered
All in traffic, bout that action
Yea it's, up there, up there, up there
Did a show don't give a, fuck there
We'll come up there
Niggas from where I come up at
Taught to up that
Shoot to kill, don't discuss that
Done that, fuck that, fuck that, fuck that
Breath easy, this street sweeper go ""Hree-hree!""
And delete people
Taking pictures all in front my car, is like dick-puller, I mean meat-beater
I met your mom, you had a good life
I fuck with your dawg, I don't fuck with you
As soon as that nigga went to jail you start doin' shit that a busta do
You don't know how to keep it street, reason why?
You not a street nigga
My uncle, mama, grandmother, thuggin'
Grew up in the street, real street nigga
Not a local rapper in your own city, boy you look disgusting
You lil' ugly, black, dirty, dusty, dingy
Pockets empty, mouth look like a place a toothbrush never entered
Young Get 'Em!
[Chorus]
I ain't got shit to do but cook like I was from Virginia
These niggas lyin' in they rhymes, you could stop pretending

Me and Stroke by myself, you know we in a black coupe thang, you heard me?
Me and Stroke down there thuggin' by ourself
You know we just, yeah all in that bitch, retawdid
You know, nigga ain't tell us nothin', you heard me?
You know every time I see that lil' bitch, he dont't move by himself
He got a whole lil' entourage and shit you heard me?
That's a sign of weakness
You know a real 'vic will sit back, and look a nigga just like weakness
I ain't takin' no diss shots at no nigga man, I'm just statin' them facts you heard me
Nigga ain't kept it street, I spoke about it, nigga caught feelings like a bitch would do, you heard me?
So, I just know that when you do a bitch, you just yeah
Look, go do what you want to, you's a renegade ho
The worst thing you can give any nigga or bitch is rejection
You know hoes love attention
You ain't got to have a pussy to be a ho
A ho is somebody that just want attention from another man
They got a lot of hoes with dicks, outchea
Right now, you know me keep that thang all the way street
You know I be listening at these niggas talk
Mane you ain't gangsta, you ain't gutta, you ain't grimy, you ain't shinin', you ain't grindin'
Look I'mma leave that there what it is

On top this piano, but keys open doors
Party ammunition, naked all night long, we can go
Spin around, i been around in and out bitch i clown

Ain't no crying now, this ain't no crime that we committed, ""hol' up wait its boutta, can i leave it in""

If life is a gamble I'm willin' to bet my last dime

Bought this bread I don't play
Goin' through hell tryna make it
Not even heaven could stand in my way

Flaws on the table, I don't feel insecure
(I say why bout that boy, are you still insecure?)
Likkle wastegyal want fi man out di slum
(Batty fine, dutty wine me a want see it done)
Me and Millz break the nine, come on boost it up a notch
Demeanour of a leader, even cooler than your socks
I would say the watch but the bitch that cold
Waitin' to exhale, but she wouldn't let go
Leanin' out the liter, I ain't gettin' strep throat
Flyer than the seagulls steady bumpin' Beanie Sigel
Disrespect it then we squeezin', I ain't gettin' stepped on
Khaza, he the sequel, if you didn't catch on
Ain't no latchin' on to my success
Breadwinners association, I move for the paper the haters consider a threat
Condo screenshotting my convo, I meant to say text
Disruptive behavior, subject to change by my chain, get upset
I'm becomin' a gangster, they have PMS
If you won't be a woman then go get a plumber and grow you some breasts
Rollin' up sleeves like a sink, spread the cabinet, layin' pipe underneath
Rap game kitchen counter, came to tighten up leaks
(Tell 'em what you mean)
Time to tighten up the leash

Oh my God, I'm a God
Neighborhood, I'm a star
Sick of red bitches, they don't listen in the car
Girlfriend in my lap while I'm twistin' the cigar
Luca Brasi, I murder bout Mazi
Mucho the boss still livin' in my thoughts
I'm a real vic, money limp when I walk
Beat a bitch back in, big dick dinner soft
Big clip by the couch wearin' zips that's an out
Public housing, no authority and the clique got a house
Try to turn speaker off blip-blip with the AUX
Tuck somethin' close to you, eatin' grits witcha spouse
No bathrobe wearin' ass nigga
Breadwinner brick game hashtag emblem
Peace sign on the hood in Benz symbol
Still goin' off, make the clique get richer
Shots on her back and her chest to the pillow
Pieces come together, playin' chess with a picture
Dog just a pawn, I be fresh, get the picture?
Knuckles all scarred up, discoloration
Mental gymnastics with this conversation
Just my little friend, this was just a vacation
I'm dedicated to the grind, real nigga discipline
Show on the road, low pros and they Michelin

Grinding from the bottom sick and tired of struggle
Shining don't want pop it off it's on the muscle
Police is harassing don't want see us come up
Cause word around town they gone check the move
Word around town I flick my neck with juice
Word around town me and yo ex is cool
And if you broke
Then you know damn well I can't stand next to you
Word around town

Shot the studio I brought the pressure through the bottle
Brought my dog Truck up he ain't do nothing about it
Section that they love to rep I'm clutching all around it
I could keep a secret and your bitch know all about it
Bread Winner 100it, taking road trips out to Houston
You was fucking off with the pill game
I'm on Carolina distributing
Late nights just me and Eazy we was tackling a few zombies
Pray to God he free all my niggas and I hate to see 'em in bondage
My daddy taught me how to get it back
Nigga trappin' in the dope game
How you a legend to a street nigga, you ain't never sell cocaine
Brian Hughes on Calumet buying everything that I bring
Then you went to jail for an illegal pistol
That you know you wasn't goin' to slang

But I'm not a fan of no Clippers
Clip to the ground, Gunna back in town
Nigga whip down he might clip you
Fuckin' with a bitch out in Baltimore
I got a shooter all out in Maryland
Went to jail all in Chicago
I'mma die about it, get at me
In Cook County you can ask about me
Imma gangsta nigga what's happenin'?
I was trying get another lil' shoulder play
Back when kush stuck me into parish
Stayed online no jacking off I'm a real nigga no rat
Young nigga but I'm old school be with OG's no laggin'
Shoulder rows bust them older cats
In the game of life I mastered
Either learn fast or ya die young being foolish end in disaster
Why focus hard on another nigga
When you could provide for your family
And anything that don't add to you
Most likely only subtract it

I'm a different kinda animal when I'm up here (I'm a silverback)
D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

[Chorus]
Takin' these journeys where I'ma need an interpreter
Haven't had a problem I couldn't solve with the murderers
Forced entry, home invasion, I know the burglars
Pardon my thoughts, I had to put up the burglar bars
People done hurt us all
Icebox where my heart was, it don't hurt at all
She got a murder charge
People done hurt us all
Icebox where my heart was, it don't hurt at all
She got a murder charge
And he got a murder charge

[Interlude]
A'ight, I'ma get it all out right here, you heard me?
This my healing process, you know what I'm sayin'?
I'm pressured

[Verse 1]
First time I ever been disappointed, think it came from my mother
I subconsciously engage in things that's makin' me suffer
And this in turn has an effect on how I deal with a woman
I try to turn 'em against their family just to prove that they love me
I put that iron on your cousin, I put that iron on your brother
And when they draw the chalk line, pretend that I don't know nothin'
I'm not the one to cross now, I ain't retire from thuggin'
Observe that I'm a boss now, I mail it out and say, ""Fuck it""
Then slim, you won't get walked down, if you survivin', you lucky
You survivin', you lucky, you survivin', you lucky

She got a murder charge
People done hurt us all
Icebox where my heart was, it don't hurt at all
She got a murder charge
And he got a murder charge

[Verse 2]
Why I'm supposed to be givin' a fuck, lil' bitch? Uh, let me calm down
Heard your opinion and I'm not givin' a shit, I'm really up now
In the H I went to Emit and got the pendant bust down
Talkin' 'bout what you gon' do to the kid, I'm out here shinin', what now?
Applyin' the pressure, she beggin' to get my attention, but ain't no love now
Say you fuckin' with someone that fit my description, but it ain't workin' out
Personal trainin' when I used to hit it, whip up and work it out
I'm really for certain now, I'm knowin' my purpose now (I am)
My insecurity wiped out, I'm knowin' my purpose now (I know)

[Interlude]
When you find someone seekin' acceptance, that's dangerous
'Cause they're not just seekin' acceptance from you, they seek acceptance wherever they can get it from
Even the opposition, yes, Lord

Takin' these journeys where I'ma need an interpreter
Haven't had a problem I couldn't solve with the murderers

Know there's a name, don't know what to call it

Bad when it came to me being on point (Get 'em)
What they say I should be doing I don't
Don't love, don't trust, don't worry I won't
Slim waist, cute face, with a donk in the trunk
Convicted felon for selling
No telling my motto, no telling
Never popped a molly but when I'm on coffee I feel as if I done just tried it
Product of a violent environment, saw niggas go get money I had to go try it
My grandma's a crying, her grandson a liar, like all of this shit gotta stop
Every time that you leave I be having these dreams about you getting locked up or shot
This first bitch I love told me that was my baby but nah, I be thinking it's not
This bitch, well she, she fucked ten of my friends, I moved on now she saying she high
Got caught, took my lick, then came home to my street, they was trying to hit me with 30
The morals I'm built on, I'll really get killed on, it ain't no such thing as me working
Game I'm in get dirty, couldn't make this up and that's certain

Saying I look like a drug dealer, you ain't even waiting our table

Do the damn thing, no champagne, for me at least a light drink (Retarded)
Going against my better judgement, opposite of right thinking
Cardiovascular happening, beat them chicks from the back while I'm wrapping it
Can't make this shit up, ain't just rapping it
Love a bitch who fight back while I'm stabbing it
Dick put her out and I walk out like [?]

Now my whips foreign, pulling up (I can't make this up)
Started from the bottom with narcotics, what I'm selling
Who thought I woulda made it from a trap with no electric

Made all of my haters all believers (I can't make this up)10Embed"

Yeah
Khaza

[Verse 1]
Eroticism for the first time when I drove you back outta Texas (Texas, woah)
Different feeling in the front room by the fireplace when we sexin' (Oh)
Move the mirror to the bedroom so I can see you, only if you let me (Oh)
Blood all on my ugh, ate you on the rag, I know I’m aggressive (Uh)
Because of the quarantine, we been meeting up, goin' joggin' together (Oh)
Calisthenics, stretching (Stretch), fitness, preference (Preference)
Kettle bell, deadlift (Yeah), plyometrics (Yeah)
Question, tell me, hey, why you so sexy? (Yeah)
Nike tights with the Vapormax, with your back out doing core work (Ooh)
Made love when we fucked first, tonight go to show you how the Lord work
Plain Jane, not flashy (Uh-uh)
Workin' out, busy craftin' (Yeah)
Heart froze and my soul cold
Might need to put on a jacket (Brr)
She favor Lori Harvey[?], take dick in the ass, I love her she nasty (Brr)
Trickin' on her, bought a bag
Life was depressin', she makin' me happy (For real?)
Small altercation, I ain't with my main
But I'm in the route of advancin'
[Chorus]
I cut off my finger to save my hand and this is how I got established
I cut off a knee them made 'em dance, Chris Brown, Michael Jackson (Wow)
My heart goes out to Young Chop, in the industry they gon' blackball him (Uh)
I sold hard with the gun cocked, I'm in the streets and the pack callin'
Crash site seven minutes from my house, rest in peace to the Black Mamba
This here goin' to Virginia, got a hunnid ki's in a black Honda

[Verse 2]
You doin' that times ten, brick it, sell legit, on the truck haulin'
They don't wanna see me win, bitch ass friends want me in the mud crawlin'
Took the hurt that they give, worked it with the pen, started coming up off it (Huh)
I cannot pretend, slide in your DM, you know that's a plug callin'
I was only here to help, fuck with you, uplift you, that's enough talkin' (For real?)
I would not open up to them again, your man, they show a love caution
I believed in myself, won't become salty, look at what comes after
.762 clip, this a high power fiber optic, firin' at you
Read a news clip about the virus, not excited, I forgot all about it
Need all the space, now give me some room
Turn up the bass and it goin' boom
Tatted the face of a hater, was sadly mistaken but Kevin won't get it removed
What Mr. T gotta think, if he see how naive I can be, he’ll pity the fool
Now I pay attention to what's in my spirit 'cause it done got clearer, it tell me to the move
Don't give it no energy, don't even mention it, all of that envy will come back to you
My name in the scripture, I'm one of them hitters
I'm back on my shit and I know what to do (Listen)
[Chorus]
Listen, I cut off my finger to save my hand, that's how I got established (Yeah)
I cut off a knee them made 'em dance, Chris Brown, Michael Jackson (Yeah)
My heart goes out to Young Chop, and the industry they gon' blackball him

I'ma break that bitch down
Met her out in town
Got her on tequila
Made her turn her ass 'round
I'ma break that bitch down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'ma break that bitch down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'ma break that bitch down

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Pull up in the car
Then let up the arms, suicide doors
I'm married to the game, never gettin' a divorce
Get in, baby this a coupe, ain't no room to fit your friend in
Red bottom, whatever, your Christian, who is 'Boutin?
Kinda new to boutiques and I don't do the salons
Swag kinda simple, I'm cute in Louis Vuitton
I'm headed to the 'telly, I wanna see you perform
No hood on the car, workin' on your vocals
Threesome after drinkin', grab a condom, we in motion
Break your bitch down, leave her sleepin' on the sofa
In the kitchen, broke a brick down, she ain't even know it

[Hook]
I'ma break that bitch down
Met her out in town
Got her on tequila
Made her turn her ass 'round

Down, down, down, down, down, down

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Out of town for the weekend, accompanied by three friends
I'm supplyin' all y'all drinks then
Vacationin' from work, end up takin' time off
Had to break up with her guy and feel like all men are dogs
Tequila kickin' as we talk and we talk
If she ain't feelin' it, she would've been walkin' off
I'm about to 'scape away, she don't leave
All I did was ask Sabatha, she won't eat
Hotel room vacant, alone, she don't sleep
Clothes off, on the sheets, provided we underneath
Hollerin' in between, I don't get tired
But wonderin' why you sleep

[Hook]
I'ma break that bitch down
Met her out in town
Got her on tequila
Made her turn her ass 'round
I'ma break that bitch down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'ma break that bitch down
Down, down, down, down, down, down
I'ma break that bitch down

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Opposite of normal
I'ma get her number, be a week before I call her
I can see the future and I'm just bein' honest
What I gotta do? I ain't tryna meet your mama
I'ma get her loose, then I slang her this iguana
Actin' like she don't but I know she really wanna
Break the bitch down if she ask of my karma
Won't pick up the phone, make her turn into a stalker
Put her out the car, don't perform and you're walkin'
You was actin' bad, buy the part, don't be heartless
You are not a star to a king and regardless
You don't have a car and a section 8 apartment
[Hook]
I'ma break that bitch down
Met her out in town
Got her on tequila
Made her turn her ass 'round

I’m either cooking dope or selling dope
Come and get it if you lookin, I ain’t stretching though
Snowing on the bluff, I’m tryna catch a slope
Up under your house, tryna listen with a stethoscope
That gangsta shit, that ain’t the shit you ready for
How I’m coming with the drum and you would never know
I dress up like a woman and then let it go
Narco trafficante, cocaina come from Mexico

[Verse 1]
Double cups of the syrup, back to back, bad move
Matter fact shawty say she like my tattoos
I don't smile, South side Baton Rouge, had it wild coming up
Didn't happen over night, took a while coming up
So and so? broke my jaw with the flash light
All because I ain't want make my pockets look like bunny ears
Killed a nigga, broke and ran, piss running down my leg
Went and hid the gun behind Ms Connie house
Out my business, learnt how to keep my partners out
Sip ya tea pussy don't know what you talkin bout
Fresh philly, with the line that rashad cut
Bought cars for my team now we all up
Get out of line with my team and we all bust
Cutting up bad, thumbin through the bands, Simon Miller pants, hanging off my ass
9 milli 38 don't make me do the hammer dance

Bricks to the South, Bito and Bryan
South 14 let the house gettin off
Redid the nova, shawty took it and then got lost on my nigga damn
Now I'm wishin I could talk to my nigga
Feds snatch Eazy, he should've ran
I wasn't lucky I got picked up with the blam
Tell the Coroner if it wasn’t for they pussy ass boy from the start being loyal but they wasn’t fam
Cocaine when it's good it be jumping back
I'm getting 2 whole things tryna run a land
When its all out war, I don't understand
Look a nigga in the eye if he under hand
Dump a rack, get em snatched like a fucking man
Hard to move by yourself lot of killer ants
Wishing I could turn back set of different hands
Nothing bigger than the B, I got different plans

I ain't running up a shift yard
30 shots out the tec before it jam
Fist fought, live raw, diving in my bitch car
Shoulder and my lip caught hell on the pitch fork
What they doing? Satan screaming ""Kevin where you going?""
You don't see all of these bad bitches I got for you
Want you to get that pussy raw and don't have no abortion
Diggin in your pocket, court appointed, child support you
Spend all your money then go broke, you know I support you
Ride with that pistol police catch you, then gon adios you
Then I'ma laugh while you in jail and act like I don't know you
Go rob that nigga over there, know he ain't got it on em
Cars pulling up, supplying em while on the corner
Graduated to your own trap, somebody try you, fire, make them take a long nap
Aye, you graduated to your own trap? Open fire nigga try, you take a long nap

As luck would have it my best friend
The brown skin nigga with the braids
Not the pussy nigga with the fade
But the short chubby nigga with the braids
Got out of jail I was flat broke
Well not broke but low funds
Funds lower than they ever was
I was tryna rap without selling drugs
Me and Eric Taylor kept grinding hard
But every plan just fell apart
His mama died every night I cried
And prayed to God to protect his heart
The label kept on booking shows
Most of which was a instant flop
This means I would appear
And perform without getting guap
This the part where it gets evil
Got deceived, couldn't believe it
My social next to a signature on a contract where I didn't leave it
Me and Tone had a lot of talks
Til' it ain't really make sense to talk
Told him what I needed as a artist
He would say ok and then brush it off
Rap game, calling for me
Let's run the ball no fucking off
Travis Vick and the name I said
Forever I'ma have love for him
Had to focus on my career
Others tryna be club owners
Got the ears of a major label
Now everybody in the world on it
[Hook]
Heart of a tiger will commit homicide
Dismantle any challenger or rival
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
N.T.M.A. to police you'll never take me alive
I'm a tiger, I'm a tiger
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
Until you make the police you'll never take me alive
I'm a tiger

[Verse 2]
Altercations, I'm thinking Travis must really hate me
Been like a brother through middle school, woulda never rapped until he made me
Really used to flip hoes together, go out together, do shows together
Still amazes me, kinda crazy how popularity can make you change
Got his Nova, I was happy for him
Got his 'Burban, I was happy for him
Got his Benz, I was happy for him
Got his Hummer, I was happy for him
No nigga round I wouldnta splattered for him
Put their head on a platter for him
Never disrespected your bitch boy
I protected your bitch boy
When niggas that we both know was tryna put dick on your bitch boy
All you ever did was criticize me
Pillow talk to the world bout me
These tear drops on my face real, my mom will tell you I'm not stuntin'
Juvenile detention for self-defense, broad day I popped somethin'
Her ex-boyfriend broke her ribs, blacked her eyes, I shot somethin'
'scuse me, I'm my own man
In jail or on land
Always tryna fight me
How the fuck you hurt a nigga you love
I would never put my hands on you, reason being you a nigga I love
[Hook]
Heart of a tiger will commit homicide
Dismantle any challenger or rival
Concrete jungle where we fight to survive
N.T.M.A. to police you'll never take me alive

Pull up to the trap while on the phone with Jamarlo
Percielago, new Camaro up in full throttle
Buying pints, check the seal, it's a full bottle

In my trap on the couch like my leg's broke
Catching sells, ain't no way I could be dead broke
Let him in, shut the burglar, lock the deadbolt

Kitchen or whipping can't be like whatchamacallit

That come from the same hood, we played together as children
You a silly boy, hold up, you don't know me, why we talkin'?
Ask your big dog about my... yeah, real retarded
Hold the shop by myself, got it then from here you bought it
Gon' step up through there, I'll spray this bitch like Mad Marvin

I just picked her up after school and smoked a blunt with her

When I leave she go to uh uh, I can't run out of money
Everybody 'bout to take a trip to Miami

Droppin' the coupe with vanilla extract in the Pyrex and try not to run 'em away (I got it)

Grabbin' it hard out the bungalow, stains on my underclothes

I'm in here practicin' over a pot
[Bridge]
Check it out, love
Make sure you shake that box up real good and ain't no clumps in it
'Cause you might be 'bout to take it back where you got it from, ya heard? (They hate to salute when you stand up)
That dude back there on the camera he grabbin' a hunnid
They come off the Yukatan, love
They come off the Yukatan, love
Bitch, you play we gon' come down there and tear Baton Rouge up

[Verse 2]
1 on a 1 and I'm 2500 a zap
Hit the H with the quinine (Uh)
I spray with the (Shh), and I dry it out
Know how I maneuver, weigh that on the ruler
Pull up with the shooter and try it out
He know I'm that pressure, he nod out
I caught the end of the drought when Obama had won the election
I'm runnin' for president
Plug got a text and went up on a number
But I made more money from fuckin' with medicines
Got me a doctor my white partna' ODed on Oxys
He showed me the ropes with the roxies
Bito and Julio, Young Fly Society
Half of you don't even know how I'm rockin'
We stand on that business, they know we 'bout action
But niggas be taking our name and they draggin' (Fuck them)
Applyin' that pressure, I hit with the 'pressor
A lot of you won't understand it
Then go to talkin' real slick, so the charges don't stick
But I'm in this bitch changin' her Pampers
Four and a half when I mix anotha two on the split
Put the bitch in the jack and restamp it
I'ma just let the bitch sit check the watch when it tick
(Ay, that's 45 minutes!)
Kiss on the bitch, put her back in her panties
I got the dope and they know that I'm swaggin'
I chill on a boat when I go to Miami
I'm in Dubai it ain't funny now
I get em for 26.5, 32 let 'em fly
I might drop em to 29 (Yeah)
Playin with the kid it'll cost you (Ooh)
I might can't move, but the car do
I'm on that money man, had to work out in the gym
At first I was fat now I'm gettin' real slim
I'm slim but I'm trim like a bicycle rim, this bitch on my dick 'cause she know what it is
[Outro]
They hate to salute when you stand up (Why is that?) (Gates)
They hate to salute when you stand up
They come off the Yukatan love
They come off the Yukatan love
They come off the Yukatan love
They hate to salute when you stand up
They hate to salute when you stand up
They hate to salute when you stand up
They come off the Yukatan love
They come off the Yukatan love
They come off the Yukatan love
They come off the Yukatan love
They come off the Yukatan love
They come off the Yukatan love2Embed"

Yeah, yeah
You hear my voice you already know what I been doin' bruh you heard me
Say Mazi you love me? 'Bout to show off for you baby
Wheezy outta here

[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Flip from nothin'
I got in and still I had to stack
The money came, still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back
Flip from nothin'
I got in and still I had to stack
The money came, it still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, I wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back

[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
When you came home, I was excited
I looked up to my cousin
The world been cold
My heart been taken
I got somebody who love me
[?] Port Allen in jail be toein' Brian and the feds
Kept it silent, dyin' inside
I wasn't right in the head
I lied to you wit' what I said, I shot myself in the head
Doin' drugs, easin' pain
I hate to get outta bed
Even ran off on my daughter
I admit I was scared
I know I could've gave her order
I was better off dead
5.7 in the cartridge
I ain't takin' precaution
I ain't scared of a army
I was tryna lay in my coffin
Smokin' without coughing
Early morning go walkin'
When my dog was still alive
We ain't never go without talkin'
[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Flip from nothin'
I got in and still I had to stack
The money came, still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back
Flip from nothin'
I got in and and still I had to stack
The money came, it still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, I wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Christmas, I don't celebrate
We on two different ends
We was suppose to be retarded
Big old house full of kids
We was suppose to cop Ferrari's
For your bitch and my bitch
Takin' sips of lean with every blunt that we twist
Remember we fucked T together
Lied and said we was twins
We even did our bids together
You come out, I go in
Late night at the car lot schemin'
On a big body benz
I'd of fucked my wife with you
That's just how this shit is
Niggas in my ear been tellin' me on you they gone spin'
Although you cut me, I still love you I don't know how to pretend
Light lil' blender with lil' Kale just to touch on her skin
Take my pain out on her pussy and then be puzzled again
[Chorus: Kevin Gates]
Flip from nothin'
I got in and still I had to stack
The money came, still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it back
Flip from nothin'
I got in and still I had to stack
The money came, it still wasn't sunny for me after that
My heart got strained, wanted to blow my brains
As a matter fact
I gave the wrong niggas my love, wish I could have it backEmbed"
