I'm gonna put you in seven positions for seventy minutes, you get it, babe
You got a lot on your mind, and I wanna ease it up and lick it and slip it in
You do a light scream on that ice cream when I scoop it and dip it in
Unzippin' the tight jeans and that feminine hygiene is magnificent
Tryna show you, girl, I'm different
I get to lickin', and stickin', and lickin', and stickin' it
'Til the pussy get too wet and it's drippin'
And splittin' both them legs like dividends
If it ends up how I want it, then you'll end up sittin' all over my bottom lip, baby
The feelin' of fuckin' you, feelings all up in you
Make it hard for you to bottle 'em, baby
This dick is too big just to swallow it, baby
But still you do it like it's Thanksgiving
And you gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', baby
Like what's a goon to a goblin, baby?
That pussy hotter than the summer June in Metropolis, baby
No hidin' it, baby
She know what it is when I come around
Let me take you down

And the way that she whip it, it's drivin' me crazy (Huh)
Think I've been hittin' the lottery, baby
Buy you a Wraith, I'ma give you my safe
Put you in apartments, you parkin' in places
Yeah, that's the real-life Monopoly, baby
We got all night to get it right, babe
So let me play
We got our whole damn life, baby

What
You and me will always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you starts acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Fuckin' you made me proud of me
'Cause I know that you doubted me
Even told me I would never get wit' ya
Told me I could never get wit' ya
But this pride in me
Wouldn't let you slide by me
That's when I came back 'round
I played my game with no respect, I finessed ya to make me seem down but
I finessed ya, it was all a stresser
I was your nigga, messed up, fucked your head up
Shoulda never came 'round
You let me in and I let you down
I was wrong 'cause I fucked up the game, baby
Your name crazy in the streets, got 'em sayin' things
My pride was the cause of it all
I apologize for the flaws in it all, wrongs in it all, 'cause

You and me... always be tight
Family every single day and... uh
And even when I starts actin' like a fool
Somehow I always can fall back on you
I know my pride, ain't always like myself
It's hurtin' you more than anybody else
And every day, what I try not to do
Is let my pride get between me and you
[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Baby, I shoulda listened when you told me
I would do better as a homie, yeah
Right there, I shoulda took a note
But pride was buggin' on me
I shouldn't, I shouldn't make excuses now
'Cause I know that it's useless now
You know what the truth is now
You swear you know how I do shit now
So I'll be gone 'til November
Talkin' old Timberlands in the winter
With this .5 on my side and my .40
You moved on but you still are my shawty
I don't wanna lie because I'm right wit' ya
You always pick me up, I don't get ya
I been tryna find your heart, I'm still tryin'
You can find someone else but you're still mine, 'cause

You and me... always be tight

And even when I starts actin' like a fool

As it's unfolding it's like—Fuck Tory Lanez, okay? Now, I’m from Houston, and he's from, bro
And to think that the whole night unfolded on social media
You are the alleged shooter of Megan Thee Stallion
Instagram, in the pool with Kylie Jenner
Was she backtracking with what she said originally?
You know, maybe that's why we don't have a report
Donkey of the day
Some bitches tryna  take up for Tory and, ""It's more to the story,"" bitch, it ain't-there ain't nothing to the story
Tory Lanez got a lot of bad press
Serious, he's gon’ get deported
Donkey of the day for Friday August 21st goes to Daystar Peterson
So they got pulled over and she had been shot already, great
Well, hold up—
Donkey of the Day
What I’m looking like, he looking at the police and then shot her?
Niggas like that, you a sucker, he's the king sucker, he’s the-he's the biggest sucker in the industry (Facts)
We gotta talk about Tory Lanez and Megan Thee Stallion
Kaash is looking for you, dawg
Because the police came out saying, ""We didn't even know she was shot""
Guess who I believe? Megan
The best thing for Tory Lanez is for real, he needs to just begone
[Interlude]
I'm done with this, you gotta know the truth
[Verse]
Ayy, they rather see me in the cell
Like how he posted out with thirty thousand dollar bail?
I’m the GOAT, y'all niggas know I made that dope float on the scale
I had them hoes goin' crazy, fiends crackin', goin' pale
They know I'm real, I got that flow, it's on sale if you need a rush
Coke blowin' out my fiend's nose like the speaker bus
Ho caught me D'd up, talk down, we T'ing up
Megan people tryna frame me for a shootin'
But them boys ain't clean enough
I see how they teamin' up, watchin' and I'm calculatin'
Gotta keep it quiet, I can't jeopardize the outcome waitin'
Seein' certain niggas hatin', like, how this nigga hatin'?
I done gave these people so much features, made these niggas famous
They was on the blog sayin' I'm canceled from this entertainment
I was on that Spotify like thirty million monthly listeners, I'm fuckin' goin' crazy
And my fans support me brazy, everythin' I do is for you, I promise I'll be on it daily
I got nothin' but love to spread, but niggas hate me
Hurt my heart to see them Twitter fingers come from Kehlani's and Kaash Paige's
But I flipped the switch, I'm grippin' money at that fast pace
And don't ask me for shit when it get real, that's my last favor
Can't cry now 'cause I'ma laugh later
Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit
Knowin' I ain't do it but I'm comin' at my truest
Tryna keep this shit two hunnid with you, shorty, I can prove it
But them people in yo ear, they the true ones that I fear
They really got you thinkin' Tory Lanez would do you in, for real
Don't forget you was my bitch, I held it down and kept it real
I would never paint no fake picture of you just for some mills
And I thought that you was solid too, but look at how you doin' me
Look at how you doin' me, people tryna ruin me
And what's even worse is I'm still thinkin' about you and me
How you goin' live my birthday with all your jewelry to try to make some fool of me?
But I love you hard so I'm gon' cool it, B
'Cause I was coolin' right with Cuban, B, that was a stupid me
Somehow I'm still down to renegotiate the unity
My heart in some foolery, this shit is just confusin' me
I'm goin' through these phases, but I gotta stack that paper
And the real estate niggas hatin', took me off that application
But when they took that from me, they really took that from my baby
What the fuck I'm finna say to his old lady?
What the fuck y'all mean, my son don't need a house?
My baby momma don't need safety?
And even though I got the payment, the real estate niggas still hatin'
'Cause he watchin' me all on the news, but I ain't charged with no cases
Say the owner say my case is lookin' crazy, how the fuck that even make sense?
New times turn to past tense
All I want is straight cash, niggas say I lack sense
Star player, hearin' lies comin' from the back bench
Kill or be killed, that's the reason I don't have friends
Niggas lyin' on the crodie, niggas sayin' I'm deported
Oh, now I'm 5'3""? Niggas sayin' I'm a shorty
But lil' bitch I'm 5'7"", money on me side-steppin'
And if I stand on my wallet, you can see my thighs in Heaven
One Umbrella gang and when we come back, don't you try reppin'
'Fore I let these niggas breathe, I gotta teach a couple lessons
Gotta see a couple questions: how the fuck you get shot in your foot, don't hit no bones or tendons?
How the fuck your team is tryna to paint me as some whole menace?
I just lost like ten million dollars because this cold business
But I got like ten million followers that's gon' roll with me
Fans that support me 'cause they know my heart
So I don't give a damn if shorty know Jigga
I was taught to beat the block
Eeny, meeny, miney in these streets, and so my Nina cocked
Niggas, y'all can play me, y'all can frame me, but I'ma reach the top
I would never put you in no danger, and if I did, you would've said it when you seen the cops
[Chorus]
Ayy, Lamborghini bands and they comin' out the floor
Fff, hit the fan when I'm pullin' out the dough-oh
I would never fall out with niggas over hoes, ayy
Money over fall outs, my nigga, that's the code-oh
Santorini bands when I pull up to the coast
Better have my bands when I pull up to the door-oh
Niggas can't believe I done pulled up in a Ghost
And I don't ever wanna fuck with y'all no more, G

[Outro]
I got bad bitches tryna have a orgy
Keep umbrellas for the days it get stormy
I pour the Henny for my niggas, that's before me
My outfit fly, you gotta seat out by the floor seats
She tatted me all on her face 'cause she adore me
They talkin' petty 'bout me but they lookin' corny
I had to fight for mine, nigga, you were sworn in
And God bless me when I wake up every mornin'12Embed"

But I told them I would make it from the bottom
Look, I made this shit possible, baby, I'm back on the shits
My baby looked at me like, ""damn it, I hate when you back on the shits""
Looked at it like this
I-I-I gotta stack it and flip
Yeah, this my Fargo shit man
I go, I go missin' for a month and this is what you do

[Verse 1]
Wait, I'ma take y'all way back, way, way back
Before the old school, before the Maybach
Whoever came back
And put the  Maple Leaf on the Jays hat
I was on court chillin' with my niggas
On the corner fuckin' with the felons
Wishin' for the Honda Civic
Pacin', smokin' outta staircases in the ceilin'
Dawg, I just want a new job
Want my old girl to get a boob job
Want my new girl to get a new job
Yellin', ""2Pac, 2Pac, 2Pac""
Two Glocks strapped all up on my waist
For any nigga trippin' around my way
Mini Mac, strapped for haters in the back
In this mini black JanSport backpack
Nigga, matter fact, uh
Rollin' blunts with my nigga Rocky
All we do is go, all we do is go, all we do is go

Couple bitches that go hand in head
I'm talkin', hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe, wait
Hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe and hoe

Two friends for my two dawgs
See I love a bitch that got a few flaws
Show my old bitches to my new broads
I got old bitches, I got new hoes
New flows, cars, clothes
Bentley whip, Ferrari doors
I'm Ari Gold in Entourage
I'm fuckin' hoes that's on your squad, uh

Got an elevator in my Hella Yela
Women love me like I'm on the Ellen show
Hella bars for my felon flow
Niggas hella hard hearin' blind to 'em
Gotta hit 'em with that Helen Keller flow
I fucked a lot of bitches, Lord forgive me
Father God, know I did a lot of sinnin'
Now, I'm watchin' every one of my decisions
'Cause I know the fact that even though I’m livin’

His hair, wack, his gear, wack
His jewelry, wack, his foot stance, wack
The way that he talks, wack
The way that he doesn't even like to smile, wack
Me, I'm tight as fuck
Look

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
All I'm catchin' is niggas on Twitter, dissin'
And talkin' lies on they lives
I cannot recognize my ex-twin in full disguise
Since I went independent, these niggas want my demise
But I am yeast to the bread, my nigga, watch me rise
I'm watchin' niggas analyze me, how you protectin' me?
But made this whole plan to fry me?
Since the event, you never called me but you can't deny me
If you got shot from behind, how can you identify me?
It's funny how you got these lil' fufu, four plaque, lil' ju-ju niggas talkin' Zulu
I coulda made the shooters make a movie like it's Hulu
But who's these new niggas, talkin', boppin' and poppin' shit
But got less than four accomplishments? I got way more to lose than you do
Uh, watchin' the industry try and ho you
Asian Doll talkin', but shawty, I don't know you
I never met you, nor have I heard a song
And nor have I seen billboards
See your name in any cert or song from out your catalog
Oop, the hat is off
Behind that tatted skin, you battered with scattered scars
But I still respect and help you
Just don't treat me like you see me out in public
And I said, ""Fuck it,"" and tried to disrespect you
JoJo, that was a bozo move
You tryna take me off a song that got you the most views
Got mad love for you, though, your label, they confused
They spent fifty on my feature, they fifty K in the lose right now, yeah
Nigga, play me, nigga, play me 'til the day I get to save me
I'm watchin' mad face and y'all niggas is movin' shady
Delusional, like
Like how that 1942 from Kylie house still got you talkin' crazy
Fuck a hail or handshake from niggas
The past months, the energy been mad fake from niggas
But I'm lifted up, bring Saran Wrap, talents gifted up
And if I drop this shit for a second, I'm back to pick it up
Unapologetically, jumped inside a pool and Kylie's face was lookin' heavenly
And though I'm innocent, they got this picture painted heavily
I pray that God remember me, faith done turn all my situations to a melon tree
Uh, J.R. Smith, it's the pot that piss
And you the last cat that should talk about some shots that hit
'Cause your performance and percentage, player
Rollin', ridin' benches, nigga, I'm from the trenches, nigga
You the type to buy a chick a eighty inch and still won't get a inch up in her
Yeah, I'm at they head, sprayin' hard like a spritzer, nigga
Baggin' niggas' ex bitches off a Insta' picture
Toes rufflin' through the sand like a Kingston nigga
Yeah, contradictions in your lines
With domestic pride crimes, we still have yet to find mines
Any time I brought these bitches up, you stressed it five times
How you try to kill the cat and then forget them nine lives?
I know it so well, I know these niggas so well
Jealous feelings, niggas best at catchin' like they Odell
It's rap niggas out here tellin' Megan she should go tell
But she won't tell the truth 'cause I'll be kicked up in my hotel
When the spiteful live shiesty, it's real trife
You niggas playin' Instagram, I'm playin' real life
Think I'm finna talk about a open case just for some likes?
I promise we done worked too many nights
Please, talkin' nights, we worked on a wage, flippin', turn through the page
We got Bun B on live sayin' I should burn in a cage
In these times of Black lives, he sayin' I should turn to a slave
If C pmiP heard that, then my nigga would have a rage right now
No diss to Pimp and Bun, but you made ""Big Pimpin',"" son
Pourin' champagne on women faces while they flick they tongue
I'm too young to give you lessons, but I'd like to give you one
Please stay the fuck up out my case, I ain't convicted, son
Chance the Rapp.. (Mmm, mmm), too irrelevant
I replaced his line with, ""My chain lookin' Heaven-sent""
Next line, next line, 'cause momma always told me, ""Don't you chew that food unless you would eat that shit for a next time""
I made too much money with Roc Nation
For niggas to be thinkin' I can't correlate the fact that it's only niggas out your roster hatin'
Contemplatin' these thoughts in my head
Like, ""How the fuck these niggas callin' me, threatenin' me not to make no statements?""
Huh, the nerve nowadays
I'm hittin' certain niggas with the swerve nowadays
Gimme one DreamDoll hit record (Mmm), I'll wait
Ayy, Masika, this your chance, you in every Twitter debate
And every Shade Room comment like common sense ain't common sense
Like we be needin' your two cents and all your vents
Fakin' a kidnappin' for your OnlyFans
And tryna front like missin' kids was your intent
If that's the type of shit you teachin' Khari, then you should sit in a pen'
And watch people disagree in the end
You try to make it facts, but it's a L-I-E in the end
Oh, it ain't funny when it's your turn
When spectators got they lighters out with gasoline and wantin' yo' burn
Fuck a caption, this is facts with no cappin'
When Michael Jackson, Prince got they masters back, what happened?
Tory Lanez got his masters back just now and look what happened?
And Chris Brown, a Black man that changed his life for the right
And still, Black Twitter findin' ways to tear him down and bring him back in
A rapper catch a domestic, y'all start to talk that action
I feel like Famous Amos after all that happened
They want the downfall of every Black man, but I ain't goin'
[Outro: Yoko Gold & Tory Lanez]
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
They can't stop me, they can't stop, mmm
They can't stop me, they can't stop
It's like, it's like, you gotta take into account
Most of these niggas got my number, like
You coulda called me, like
You know what I'm sayin', like
In the most sincere way, you coulda asked, like, nigga, like, ""What happened? Did you do it?""
You know, even that woulda been straight to me, you know what I'm sayin', like
I guess I'm just different
But it's all good, nigga, I'ma continue to shine
You niggas could never stop me, nigga
You'll never put my back against the motherfuckin' wall, nigga
As long as my toes in the sand on God's green Earth, nigga
I wear the crown, shinin' notoriously and gloriously
I'm on a whole 'nother set of time, nigga, Super Saiyan five, nigga
Come out swingin', like Broly, you niggas'll never stop me, nigga
'Cause every time y'all niggas throw somethin' at me, nigga
I just keep risin', I never stop, I never back down, nigga
Back to the wall, I stand tall, nigga
Forever Umbrella, uh, uh, Tory, Canada

No, you don't know my name
Lately, all these bitches want is my fame
You don't know that you the one on my brain
I hit you with that late night text when I'm on the road

Hustle with them dealers when it's time to get that bling for you
Knock it out the ring for you

And it's obvious I'm here to fix you?
When I can't go no longer, I need someone stronger
To hold on to get through
And I stay by your side, girl, you know I'ma ride

You say that you know my name, the songs that I sing
The set that I bang, the shit that I claim

Know my name, no, no
And I know this, I'm ashamed
By my name, I'm not talkin' 'bout the name you call me, I'm talkin' 'bout who I am
And I know you don't know my name (You don't know my)
She knows the songs that I sing, all the shit that I claim

And it goes on
Kill a pussy nigga with his pantyhose on
The gun is equipped for what ever hand it goes on
To kill a backpack nigga with his Jansport on
Geek ass nigga
Dweeb ass nigga
Never had a G-pass nigga
'Bout to ski mask his ass and eat fast nigga
Pull the heat fast and blast
And leave that nigga
With his seat back nigga
I'm a number one nigga in no time
I been waiting for a nigga to give me the showtime
In the jungle waiting for you to slip on the oak vine
I'ma do this nigga like I was chewing a pork rind nigga
Eminem couldn't get ya to a million on the 'Gram
Chris Brown tried, nigga failed both times
I done took ya page to a million in a day
If you ask me, nigga, I'm ya motherfucking cosign
I'ma hit the pussy ass nigga with a clothesline
I'ma have to catch a nigga slipping in my own time
I just took the flame on a private ass plane
Out to Massachusetts, catch this nigga slipping in his hometown
Ya see what go around come around and go around
So I got his hoe going round like it go around
Let these niggas know I'm not the one to toe-to-toe around
Singing ass nigga not the one to leave your hoe around
I'm about to hit him with the end of the K
Word to my niggas in Heaven I'm 'bout to send em away
I'm exhausted I kill this nigga two times
24 hours man this shit been a repetitive day
Nigga tell me is it Joyner Lucas, Lucas Joyner?
I'm the nigga who destroy ya
Coupe deploy ya, label drop ya, who's the lawyer?
Buy ya contract from them back and be who employ ya
Oops, I'm going, who's condoning? Juice and jonesing
Met ya bitch she too conjointed
Tryna ask this pussy ass nigga who the fuck want smoke
But the lightskin niggas in ya crew too spooked to join in
I'm a nasty nigga, then you could ask these nigga
The shotty dumping popping up outta the backseat, nigga
I'm 'bout to leave his body bloody like a maxi, nigga
I tax these niggas, get at these niggas, attack these niggas
The venom is arachne, nigga
I'm 'bout kill da man and da man that done backed these niggas
And blam any man that'll try to dap you niggas
And clap any stan fan that attract you niggas
See ya daddy was a musician that never made  it
'Cause when you was born nigga it was you or him
Shattered knowing he would never make it as an artist
And the odds of his life prolly be 2 to 1
But I give it to him 'cause he didn't run
I guess he figured, ""man when you look at it in a nutshell
All I got is a failed music career and
My revenge is giving that shit to my son""
Nigga I'ma flossy nigga
They try to toss me nigga
The 45th I get em off me nigga
I block niggas Chris Bosh these niggas
I got figures pish posh to niggas
I dump niggas, jump, criss cross these niggas
The pump leave 'em slumped, in the car seat nigga
The skunk in the trunk was an awkward nigga
That thought he didn't need to have caution with him
A cornball with a Boston fitted
I said hold up my nigga man this shit crazy
You fucked AYLEK$ man that shit crazy
Nigga said he out here running threesomes with the
Nigga that's in court dealing with the kid cases
I'ma hit a stain then I hit a bad one
Pull up on the nigga hold em up for ransom
I got five plaques this year, you did a whole song with Eminem and still don't even have one nigga
Damn, my lil homie that’s a bad one nigga
Really feel bad for you it's a sad one nigga
Hold your head steady maybe you could have one nigga
Hit me for a hook and maybe get a plaque young nigga
Shout go out to Wayno and Ak my nigga
Tomorrow they'll be talking 'bout you got smacked young nigga
From the pack my nigga
I'm keeping this shit a stack, my nigga
That ""Litty"" verse was wack, my nigga
They go hard my dawg, but I go harder nigga
Atcha head with the fade like a barber nigga
Try to come for the boat and I'ma harbor niggas
Be smart like a Harvard nigga don't start with niggas
And he got a problem with us
But nigga, I know how to solve it nigga
This is my son
I'ma tell 'em like Star Wars, ""Lucas, I am your father"" nigga
You a perpetrating, work for hire, twerk for payment
Busta Rhyme impersonating, worthless baby, irks him daily
Hurts to say it, burger flipping, birthed in 80s
Tryna be a 90s baby, thirty something tryna chase it
Tryna make it, rocks designer, kinda fakes it
Hates to face it
That he'll never be a nigga that be placed for A-list, niggas damn
Here's what he's thinking right now
""I'm Joyner Lucas, why did I start it with this guy?
Tory Lanez coming back what am I gonna do this time?
They ain't like none of my diss lines
Everybody knows I can spit it in quick time
Even if the lines is as shitty as 6ix9ine's
But this time they ain’t really letting me get by
Fuck I'm finna do with this shit now?
Damn I know this nigga finna be wild
Knowin' this nigga bout to kill me on it OD now
Don't nobody ever wanna book me for a show
I ain't got no songs when I go I spit freestyles
Try to make songs 'bout depression
But nobody ever get it
So I take it out on popping niggas beats now
I ain't never ever trapped
I ain't never slung a gat
But the world don't know so fuck it, I'm a G now""
Man, what the fuck wrong with him?
I know something wrong with him
I got a hundred bunch o' bullets 'bout to put 'em all in him
Nigga walked in with a hundred rounds in him
And he's seen a nigga chicken I was comin' down in it
Glock nine nigga gotta run around with it
I'ma son a nigga, keep it at least one-a-round with it
Backpack niggas ain't sellin' no records
Better dumb it down with it when you come around with it
[Outro]
This shit is easy man
Yo it's crazy nigga
I'm really-, I'm really-, I'm really being very generous, you know?
Like I'm really doing you a favor, it's not a lot of niggas in my status that come down just to, you know, to come down and spank you niggas, pause man
It's crazy, but you know
I'ma do for you what niggas didn't do for me - that's older brother status
So if you blow from this point on, I'm your cosign nigga, you know what it is

Papiyerr

[Verse]
Woo, damn
I ain't been broke in a minute, don't get offended
Tore off the bow in a Bentley, fucking your ho in her kidney
Fuck up the city, I do not dance, I jiggy
Gun is tucked under this Fendi
I like it, I spend it, I just came right out the jeweller
The ice on my neck, and my wrist, and my fist, I ain't finished
I was just workin' at Denny's, came back and counted some millions
I ain't no regular civillian
Red, yellow, green, look like my neck a chameleon
Ugh, okay, spin it, ugh
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I hit his bitch, he offended
I'm in Givenchy and Fendi
They let me finish
I cut that Chevy for four day
My scammer bussing bottles off the '08
I cannot cuff, she fucking on my brozay
I'm just gon' fuck her, treat her like a throwaway
Ooh, damn, I ain't been broke in a minute
I'm at the mall out in Venice
I need it, swiping the digits
Calling up Kelz, he did 250 on biddie
It ain't no biggie, uh
Moncler, kick it
Fucked that lil' bih, made a viddie
She wanna leak it
She wanna send it
Ayy, fuck that bitch, my face wasn't in it
Damn, bitch do scams on bitty
Bands in my hands look pretty
Hit another band on the 'gram, I'm litty
When I was broke, man, she fronted, but then I got rich and I hit it
Homie, I don't dance, I jiggy
Weed is so strong, I feel like I'm Popeye off the spinach
I cut the corner and bend it
Bitch, I'm a menace like Dennis
Don't sell me pussy, I need a percentage
If you gon' fuck me, this shit is expensive
Nordstrom Rack, swipe my gift
Damn, I ain't been broke in a minute, ayy (Woo, woo, woo)
[Outro]
I ain't been broke in a minute, damn (Woo)

(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
She drop that damn thing on me
I stand up throwin' bands up, girl, everything on me
You know I'm in this bitch with my niggas, long thing in my jeans
It's gettin' late and these niggas rowdy, don't leave without it on me
I got them stones all in my chain (Whoa)
Big dollar my bank (Roll)
Said that she ain't cuttin', I said ""What the fuck did you came for?"" (What the fuck you came for?)
T.O. nigga, it's T.O. bitch
I'm headin' to wherever I'm gon' see your bitch
If niggas hatin' on me, put the hammer all in my hands
When she see me up in that three, she went magic all on her man
'Cause she know what's up
Oh yeah, she know what's up

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You ain't got a man? Come fuck wit' me (Uh-huh)
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG (Uh-huh)
You know I got them bands, they all on me (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna roll, so, you can tell me no
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
Say you ain't got a man, sure enough
I pull up in that Lamb', hold up (Hold up)
We both want it, we can't blame no one
And I ain't tryna play no one
But he can't make you famous like this
No, he don't got you feignin' like this
Say, he might had your body but tonight I'm in yo' soul (Yo' soul)
Girl, just keep playin' my shit
Lo-love the way I talk, I make you love the way I sing (Sing)
Love the way I walk, I'll make you love the way I swang (Swang)
Girl, I make you (Make you)
Love everything that you don't love about these niggas
Girl, I love you naked (Love you naked)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You ain't got a man? Come fuck wit' me (Uh-huh)
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG (Uh-huh)

But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up
But I know your body know what's up

'Cause when you drop that thing on me
Like it's the end of the night
I swear if niggas hate, you know I got that thing on me
No need for no fight

You ain't got a man? Come fuck wit' me (Uh-huh)
Roll up in that Benz, that AMG (Uh-huh)

Me, I'm really tryna go
Now that I got you, it's goin' down
So girl, don't you run from me

I'ma feel up, feel down, feels alright
Might have to fly your ass to Toronto
(Hold up, why?)
'Cause shawty got that ass like a model, oh
And all these other women ain't got nothin' on her
You know that ass stop me from leavin' here tonight and tomorrow

Told you there's no need to be shy, oh why
I be waiting in the meantime, oh why
You always got me on stand by
When you know I need love
I'm missing when we was us

I remember us livin' not too far from the junkies, the flunkees
That tried to punk me on corners but never sunk me, I swear
In this bitch, yeah I'm killin' this year
Them boys hated, they gon' feel it this year
I bought a 'Rari, I only drove in it once, I'm movin' different this year
I'm leavin' thousands, talkin' millions this year
When niggas really talkin', talkin' over, talk it over
Renegotiate and make the play and they cough it over
I crossed over like Iverson when he dropped the shoulder on Jordan
The feelin' more than the sport when you winnin' fuck how they feelin'
The feelings got left aside, I told them to step aside
I'm really eatin', I'm orderin'  extra sides, you know me
'Round the block, glovers spittin' them hot flows
My scent smells like Michelle was touchin' Barack's clothes
Presidential, the flow is so evidential
At the clearport customs, I barely show my credentials
Don't need it tinted, I want you to know who's in it
Had me offended last time that I walked in the Holt Renfrew
Let's break it down for 'em, account this
If every show is a hunnid thou' for him then that mean
A hunnid minutes on stage will equal a hunnid K
That's one thousand a minute so please don't get offended
If I walk inside a store and spend thirty-five in it
'Cause, to me, that's just thirty-five minutes
Land in Jamaica, sip on a Guinness and get it
Who wanna witness, my nigga? I'm really sick with the shiznit
I brought big Poppy out at the SumFest
Sean Kingston watched it from the side stage
I made triple the advance that he had gave me in my first year
Forty-five minutes of me on stage
And I'm not amazed, I think the tables turnin'
I think you learn from the bridge you burn when you see it burnin'
I think you learn from the world when you see it turnin'
I went from being a server to being this platinum deserver, you feel me?
Did a song with Meek Milly, called it ""Litty""
Really I just did that shit for the city in love with Philly
God, this chinchilla fur on me, just in case it gets chilly
Burner on my side pocket, just that's in case you get illy out here
Me and Travis Scott almost fought at the Mala Luna
We both agreed shortly after that it was music
We possibly could be doin' that's bigger than tryna ruin it
So my apologies, nigga, just forgive me for doin' it
History made in New York City, we called a truce at the tower
I only brought a couple niggas with me
The beef was finished as soon as we took the picture, the world was watchin'
The attention in the industry started shiftin' to me
Lord forgive 'em, Lord forgive 'em, I was trippin' all the time
I spit subliminal dissin', just tryna rip shit
Not realizin' if I took the time to kick it and me and Drake mendin' bridges it'd probably equal to winnin'
Got the hardhead flow, money come in so thick
Them niggas call it hard bread dough
I'm in this all red four seater, I'm leanin' like the '06 fours
I said I'd stop freestylin' but fuck it, oh well
A nigga flow so well, I'm like a samplin' kit
Give a fuck 'bout who get pissed about by samples and skits
Niggas mad I'm remixin' they shit-pshh
Fuck out of here, nigga, stop being a bitch
I think it's time we cut the silence by niggas that's talkin' violent
Speak of silence and give 'em coffins and violins playin'
R&B niggas with Sisqó haircuts, wildin' and stylin'
They dissin', guess they just tryna go viral, I feel 'em
This your favorite song, this gon' be your favorite song
'Cept when I say it, it's really the people's favorite song
You did a vid dissin' to flex the i8
I could've flexed a 'Rari or Wraith, but nigga, I ain't
Instead, I bought my house the other day, I'm flexed in the paint
Real estate, I'm property shoppin', bitches probably watchin'
Got the Gadget-Go flow, Nobu and So-Ho
I've been crossed by some niggas I used to go toe-to-toe for
Blow for blow flow, sick enough to eat a blowfish
G5 jet playin' Go-fish, eatin' gold fish
Just for the record, I did this shit for the hopeless
Just drove a Rolls through the hood on the corner where I was homeless
It's Fargo16Embed"

Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
And she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Brooklyn Myrtle Ave. is her birth place
Facin' the city, quotin' Biggie on all her worst days
I used to take the train with her so none of these lames get her
The danger of livin' from where she was at was a plain picture
I used to paint pictures on how we could gain riches together
Instead of listen, she kinda just blew me off
Paid it no mind but it kind of just threw me off
I guess I figured everybody want riches and of course
But she just wanted a better family because her parents divorced
Early, her papa, he was taken by the force
Mother on crack and she never had time to bathe her
'Stead she gave her to her uncle, her brother who played the savior
'Til the day he started datin' this chick
That had put him up on mad pills and fuckin' up mad bills
She told me that one night he had got so fucked up
He fell asleep on his sofa, then woke up a new persona
And walked inside of her room and told her remove her clothing
And forcefully started chokin' her and tellin' her not to move
'Fore she could even finish, she broke out in tears and did it
Told me that for years, this night was a repetition, a feeling of fear
That she couldn't seem to exit or quit it, the feeling was there
Started talkin' lower as she told me come here
She said she had to make choices
So she got involved with niggas that make noise with them thangs, you feel
Ran off in her uncle's spot with the stainless steel
Put the burner to his face with this aim to kill
And said, she don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
She got herself inside of this situation in the first place
Figured that this intimidation was the worst case
She sat back and blew six in that boy face *gun shots*
Shot, him, dead
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
He don't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas is the reason
He got himself inside of this situation in the first place
He had no father figure, he told me that his papa got shot in the face
And he can't wait to find out who his killer
He dedicated his life and now wants to know this
To find out who had a motive to kill his only father
He felt, it had to be somebody close
It couldn't be somebody far away that didn't know him, but take this part in
When he was younger, he used to roll with his cousin
A woman that used to show him the ropes
She used to tell him
""Don't ever let no nigga or woman touch you
And if somebody do then all they would hear was the baka-baka-baka-baka""
One day, he was on the block rollin'
Then, this crack fiend woman came to him, told him
That she was his mother, man, that shit had him frozen
He ain't want to believe her 'til she said, ""Boy, you got a birthmark above your scrotum
A scar up on your eye came from when you was four
When you fell off in the road""
At that point, he looked at her face and he froze
She told him hold on, it's something she gotta show him
She says to him, ""I was gon' wait until you got older
But something was on my mind, was pressin', I had to show you
The whole block know me and the whole block know you
The whole block been knew this story but they ain't told you""
His mom says to him, ""I hope you know your pop was a good man
But he just had some nonsense to him
Huh, well, one night, he's fucked up on the pills
I'm tryna tell him stop but everything I'm sayin' fails
You see, your lil' cousin in Brooklyn where we would leave ya, uh
I know she love you but the story's more deeper, uh
You see, your father used to be a creeper
He used to fuck her, used to touch her, used to beat her
Used to leave her so confused she would lace her own coke and reefer
Wait, I know you wanna interrupt but this get deeper
You've been livin' this mission, you tryna figure who's the nigga
Or the perpetrator of killin' your pops, nigga? When your cousin is the reason he got shot, nigga
She put six shots in him out the Glock, nigga""
His anger was dwellin' all on his mind
He didn't know what to do, he started grippin' his .9
And uh, before he knew it, he aimed it up at his mom
And uh, huh- *gun shots* -he shot her right in the spine
He said, ""This is why my life has been full of lies
Don't nobody care for me, fuck it, what's the use in tryin'?
This Glock on my side, if I put it to my mind
I know that I'ma die but in Heaven, I'll be alive"" *gun shot*
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Adrenaline pumpin', heart pacing racing, altercations, we lit
Blood drip stain the ground, boy get down, you hit
Same hood, different day, same whip, different clip
Lettin' off, somehow we end up in the same shit

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Stunt, get jumped on, slashed or dumped on
Same block you pump on is the spot you get slumped on
Tory told me the story, it sounded a little crazy
A little Nas, a little 2Pac, Brenda's havin' a baby
How much pressure can you take 'fore you snap or break? Love turn to hate?
Fuck shit or fake, your next move may raise the murder rate
From average to savage, to semi-automatics
It's tragic how the static'll have us goin' at it *gun shot*

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Said I want you on my head
No, I won't leave you lonely
You hold your head up high
I won't let go
'Cause I can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely
Can't leave you lonely

I got a million flows, I can go silly with those
I got a pocket rocket
Down to cock and chop and pop a nigga that really impose
Niggas that's with me is villains in hoodies
That lost all they good and they feelings on road
It's so appealing, the feeling of killing a nigga that pose
Get Milli Vanillied with those
Turn a beef plate to a cheesesteak
Bitch, I be really in Philly with those
Neck rocky as a blizzard, a nigga flex gotten bigger
My wrist is so chilly, it froze
Really I'm colder than ever, my niggas goin' for whatever
Niggas gripped up, fifth tucked in the snow storm or the weather
Sandstorm or the desert, hands drawn on a Dessy
Leave his whole body bloody
Like shorty done put in her tampon on already
Shooting with a Vietnam cannon out the Peter arm on the levy
See, the charm on already
We go to jail, this shit'll be fire, we'll meet up with friends
'Cause all of our mans gone-gone already
Nigga the-, nigga the-, uh
I'ma do a three in week, I gave the Jeep the receipt
Either the double-R stitching, it's that or the Bentley B in the seat
I got my D in a freak, I gotta be in repeat
She wanna eat every morning
I treat it like porridge and gave her the cream of the wheat
And I rock it like P and a B
I don't cop it less it's Louie, Gucci on the pocket
Or even a D and a G, 'cause the way that the money piling
I'll be wildin' 'til a nigga make about a B in a week
Fuck niggas hating on me
But I'm Gary Payton, always on the team with the green
And the money counter, 'cause when I'm accounting
It be money coming in and coming out it, paper cut the money
Dummy niggas, I been thumbing out it
Trying not to run up out it in a fist fight
With a knife, nigga brought a gun up out it
Don't you run up out it, lil nigga
Uh, hit him with a mini MAC
Is he really that bad that I gotta hit him with a bigger gat?
Matter fact, riddle me that
I'm literally at the spot that he said he'd be at, but where is he at?
Like, really nigga? Is you really tellin' me that?
Like I ain't prepared to hit him with a felony act?
Like, what you thought, I would never react?
Have a nigga lookin' like he tryna fight in Smash Bros
When a nigga put a whole shell in his back
Fuck niggas yelling it back
Niggas get high and start hating on a real nigga
It's like a nigga smokin' on a jealousy pack
Look, lil' nigga, uh
I got the remedy, I got the shooters with hidden identities
Fuck who you send at me
I got a stack on me long as a ruler and centipede
I got the Genovese, I got the energy
I got the money, the power, the enemies
I go to business
I'm asking these niggas for 60 percent of the entity
No one defending me
Niggas is talking, but no one offending me
Niggas know what the result of the end'll be
Niggas won't know how to find where they men'll be
I'm a way different nigga on Hennessy
I got the recipe, none of y’all niggas sit next to me
Guard where your head and ya chest'll be
I suggest you niggas never go testin' me
I suggest you niggas never go testin' me, nigga
[Outro]
I promise y'all niggas I do this shit in my sleep, it's easy
I come to the studio and just say shit and it comes out that way
You know what I mean?
I promise y'all we down to go 36 hundred thousand rounds with anybody
Let these niggas know that all that rapping fast shit
We can do it too, nigga
Niggas be thinking they got that special sauce
Not today, nigga
Ain't that right, man?
Y'all know what the fuck goin' on, man
Who next? Who next? Who next? For real, who next?

The only love I felt was from the dealers and the hustlers
We gon' do the most, so tell them niggas GABOS
Seen my nigga Harvey, he went and copped him a Ghost
Through the windshield, the centerfold on the door

She got someone that she sees late night, I know this
I'm just tryin' take that position from em'
We been talking on the low, I know one day you'll notice

I think I found her, she's so astoundin'
Everywhere she go, that music play, she looks so soundish
Niggas crowd around her, but that's ain't what she round for
Search around the world and I can't find what she surrounds me with
I know that she was made for me
I know that heaven must've saved you just for me
The way that I feel right now can't be coincidence
The way that you feel right now can't mean you're innocent

[Pre-Chorus]
To all of the ones that have been in love with you
This is a fuck you to all you niggas
We had some good times, I've been in love with you
All of them good times, I wish them good times

Come back to me
Come back to me

Ain't no one can stop this feeling that we got, no oh
You make it feel the way you used to feel back when we did it
Oh listen baby, top down in the winter your city baby, hey
How many shots does it take just to get you all on it?

Fuck them other niggas, you see me all in your day shift
Money on me lookin' like it went and got a facelift
You been trippin', I been trippin', still ain't on the same shit
You still in my kitchen, arguin' about the same shit
Who and what and why and why I don't call you my main bitch
Everything is changin'
Friends turn to strangers, friends turn to dangers
Friends ain't your friends if they givin' ultimatums
Flippin' all the pages, dip off in the Range, oh
I done been through all these stages
You just act so different now, ain't nothin' that amazes
Me when you be trippin', how you speak when you be trippin'
I can see that you be slippin', that's tequila that you sippin', I know
Yes, that I was trippin', I envisioned somethin' different from the situation
You was my bitch, not only that, you was my nigga
Got me through when all these niggas hated
You started takin' me too serious and that's when all this desolated (Damn)
You yourself don't even know the full story
Why you lettin' people escalate it?
And I know you got them people in yo' ear
But we both know the situation, niggas hate it
Fuck all that for now, we'll talk about it when it's time
It feel like my lil' baby been confiscated
Taken away from me, I was makin' a way for us
We was trippin' off them couples, tryna do it how they do it
We was up and she was up and I was up, we PJ flew it
It was fluent, had us movin' like it's water to the fluid
I'm your water, you're the cruise, I had it movin' how you movin', woo
Out of mind and out of sight, I been gettin' right
I slid with the crodies, I been on the flight
Nine bands in my pocket, .19 on my right
I been outta pocket, I had to get right
I pray to the Lord, yeah, I had to get right
Lord, please give me patience when I see them lie
I hope one day me and you see eye to eye
I hope one day me and you see eye to—
[Bridge]
We both know what happened (We)
What happened to passion
Doin' the most and you know that it's takin' me back in
Hidin' emotions and stories, but you know it don't work

[Verse 2]
A couple things won't ever change
The common propaganda around my name is never strange
But when does it get strange?
When you start lyin' to your best friend 'bout us doin' things
And hopin' she ain't entertain?
Or is it strange when the lovin' come with secrets and the games?
When the world unveil your curtains and all they laughin' at's your pain
But does it change when we both reveal that both our mothers died?
And we still dealin' with some pain and need someone to entertain
Or does it change when you break down in my arms and start cryin'?
And feelin' like you alone and I tell you, ""Everything's okay""
And I know I ain't runnin' game, even Munchie know my aims
But will you ever know my name and not just Tory from this fame?
Will we ever talk about this? Will we ever console again?
Or will we keep on actin' like I put you in danger and some pain?
And when you hop back in the car with me, you knew everything was safe
Pshht, please don't let these niggas make you change
We both know what happened that night and what I did
But it ain't what they sayin'
But when the feeling's change, the pain start oozin' from the heart
And start cruisin' through the vein
Start leakin' out your mouth when you hop on the live and talk live
It's oozin' through your brain, listen
We watched them animes, still granted from my player phase
Potentials of bein' Bey and Jay, just watchin' for my fan base
I'm just tryna get back to the days when you would hop back on the jet
Land in Miami for a span of days and stay with me
Or back when I would do the same, Atlanta plane from A to Z
And pull up in your driveway in the AMG
When 4oe would run up out the door and you would come outside, lookin' gracefully
And I'd step out the car and see your two arms embracin' me
We both playin' games with money, powers and fames
But just tell me how it changed, have your feelings rearranged?
Or deep down, are they the same? 'Cause I just wanna reconcile with ya
Spend a while with ya, send some flowers, watch a smile hit ya
After Kellen do your hair, you send a wild picture
Then you callin' me to come step out with ya
Type of shit I like to do, type of ways I like to move
All directions in my view, still pointin' right to you, damn2Embed"

Tell me why your bitch keep patrollin' like she 5-0
Say that she my bitch, but that bitch ain't even side ho
She gon' keep on workin' it for Fargo 'til her thighs broke
I can't throw no benjis if I ever see my side broke
Talk about your money, that's that shit that I don't gotta
Would talk about your bitch, but tell the truth, man I forgot her
I'm smokin' on some potent shit, that's loud as a whole choir
And I don't say shut up no more, I just tell a ho quiet
They know why, shit 'cause

I really hope you never ever get to love me
I'm thinkin' of all the times that you dubbed me
Now that I'm poppin', you got me right where I wanna
Right where I wanted to be when you would love me
Caught you slippin' in LIV and sippin' bubbly
You took a look at these niggas, ain't none above me
I tried to give you my heart, but girl, you don't know
I tried to show you affection, but no, it won't show
I told you, ""Baby, just wait, we need some time and all""
I told you just love me, give me some time to ball
The way you lookin' is like a thousand dollars
With my confidence, took every ounce to holler
I really hope you never get to love me
I wanna be somewhere stuntin', sippin' on bubbly
Not even a thought of you in my mind
Visions of you went blind
Ooh, you used to call just to tell me
That you ain't all the way get it, but, girl, you felt me
Part of that reason why I always try to tell you
You held it down, I'ma get you the bag with the Chanel C's
'Cause it was us against the world, fuck what they tell me
I figured they was hatin' on us and it was jealousy
But I should've listened to the shit they was tellin' me
I thought you was takin' a W, it was just an L on me
Now I'm caught up in this situation where L-O-V got the best of me
I'm tryna find somethin', tryna align somethin'
Still hopin' and prayin' that you'll be my somethin'
Out layin', and hopin' prayin' that you done datin' me
I know I treat you better than your man, yeah, fuck that nigga
Tryna treat you better than he can
[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I know you that you ain't really 'bout to dub me
I know you wanna tell me that you love me
Girl, I know you wanna ride it like a Harley
Know you wanna let me swim in that tsunami
Swear I never felt like this way 'bout nobody
Swear I never felt this way 'bout nobody
Girl, you got me doing things that's just not me
Sprung over you, girl, I cannot be
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)
I can't get you out my mind, girl
You know you've been actin' out of line, girl
Don't say, ""Not today,"" 'cause today I got the time, girl
I been actin' like I'm fine, girl
Goin' insane, losin' my brain
You playin' these games, but you know I ain't
I don't be trippin' off bitches, this strange
Not to call you out your name, you know you my main
Man, fuck this fame
How they came in our world, changed everything?
Right away, in a day
Niggas hate, bitches hate
Niggas fake, bitches fake

[Interlude]
Hey, look at him, man
I hope he doesn't hurt you too bad
[Refrain: Trey Songz]
Girl, I know some things have changed (Things have changed)
But you see, you and me, we still a thing (Oh)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Really, baby, you should never get to love me
Pillow talkin' with niggas and tryna dub me
You really got the audacity to discuss me
You really got some audacity, you disgust me
And it'd kill me to say these things about you but
I know the way you think about the two of us
I know the way you think about movin' on
But me, girl, I'm not used to maneuverin' much
Tell me I'm doin' enough
Tell me I'm doin' too much
Tell me that you've been in love
Girl, you not doin' enough
I threw the towel in twenty times, I threw it too much
Baby, this shit been a lot
Plus you've been doin' enough
You can't lie, you got time
You heard stories about my drip
Why does it take for me to do somethin' good
For you to come around? That's why I drift
And I know (Know), you's a pro (Pro)
Known for heartbreak after the sheets
I'm tryna keep my composure, I'm a soldier
And deep down, I'm still a G, so (Yeah)
[Outro: Tory Lanez & Trey Songz]
I'm gon' raise my glass to this (Raise it up)
Fly back to Los Angeles (Back to Hollywood)
Won't forget you were scandalous (Won't forget)
Won't forget you were scandalous, yeah (No)

[Verse]
I hope you find somebody more toxic
And y'all go through way more arguments than we did
Y’all go through way more arguments than needed
You better give him the same fuckin' treatment
I know it's just the intro and this shit get deep, but
I’ve got my reasons
I put my work in, it wasn't worth it
My stresses turned you to the person for somebody else
I made you worth it for somebody else
I endured all of your flaws 'til I broke through all the walls of your guard
Now you're perfect for somebody else
I'm ‘bout to call her, bruh, I ain't gon' lie
I know she's somewhere with a good guy, no
She’s out with a guy who push a pretty penny
Her friend just let me know, she said he gets more paper than me, yeah (Damn)
There goes my ego
This shit is weak though
My heart is cold, this shit is brick
My shit is Shaq at the free-throw
Tryna get you back with all these cheap hoes
And you don’t even peep though
I let you take 'til there was nothing left of me
I seen it all ’til there was nothing left to see
I know she would leave me, what you telling me?
‘Cause when it's said and done, all I got is these melodies
You wasn't there when I was selling CDs
Juggin' at the TD, I was making CiCi’s
Money comin' out, I'm watchin' it in 3D
You told me I'd be nothing, now I'm on the TV
Fast forward, couple years later, see me, yeah
Come and see me, yeah
Come and see me, bitch
Car futuristic, shit, it come with three seats
Took the last feedback, it don't come with TVs
I stopped wearin' Chrome Hearts and AMIRI jeans
Gettin' too much money and it's bustin' out the seams
Shawty, don't act like I didn't meet you on the scene
I only slept on you because you started sellin' dreams
Oh my God, I don't even know, I'm so ashamed right now

[Intro]
She been fuckin' rich niggas since nineteen (Since nineteen)
No money inside her bags, just drugs and Maybelline (Maybelline)
Seems like money's got you doing anything
Anything, anything
Servin' looks, you deaded me all for the finer things
Fuck me good and then you tellin' me all kinda things
It's like money's got you doing different type of things
Honestly, like I don't know why I did that, but I did, yeah
Girl, I heard you fucked that nigga in some shit I bought you
It hurts to know that that's some different shit I taught you
You left me for someone that was icy
With all that ice, don't you forget you gotta

What it's hittin' for? I'm toxic, you know it (You know it)
Even your friends say I'm not shit, and you know it (You know it)
She hops in my double-R, she'd rather cry tears in the stars
And she knows them other guys in the double-R ain't like us
They ain't doing it like us
Movie is playin' and they ain't queuing it like us
Maybe I'm toxic, maybe I'm not shit
You went and found yourself another option
Liquor, I'm gon' sip
Sip until I get depressed in this bitch
Then I'ma call you right up on the flip
Fifty reasons why your nigga ain't shit
Fuck them niggas if I'm not at the top
I go crazy, I'ma make this shit hot
DM your nigga and blow up your spot
Fuck up the relationship that you've got
Fucked it up and now I'm calling you mine
There's no real intention of making you mine
I just don't wanna see you with no one else
Like I'm the only one allowed to move on
(I told you)
I'm a fuckboy for sayin' that shit, girl, I know it
I don't deserve you for playin' that like that, I know it (I know it)
But through these toxic eyes, I see potential
Took advantage of the fact you gotta

I won't OD on them guys that came before me, oh, I
Movin' lowkey (Movin' lowkey on—)

But since you left my bed, girl, my sun don't shine
I just haven't been myself, no, this ain't good for my health
So tell me, can you help it?
Baby, let's remind each other love is for us if we don't rewind

They really gon' get all their people in place, Swavey
So call off the ventin' and call up the Lord

So you took a chance with me 'cause you heard I'm cool
Well let me show you why what you heard is true
And you're supposed to feel like it's all for you
And this is what we 'bout to do here
I dance around my house to your favorite song
It's electrifying when you got my t-shirt on
And I wanna touch but I just stay cool
And this is what we 'bout to do

[Pre-Chorus]
It don't take a lot to keep it unpredictable
As long as you let me love your heart and touch your soul
And when you give it up to me, you give your all
'Cause all that I give in return is

Cold, hard, hard love
Cold, hard, hard love

Put your records on, hot sex all up in the air
Wakin' up my fingers all up in your hair
Those eyes you do make my world blue
And what we 'bout to do is
Now take hold of me, baby, I feel it too
Never been this far from safe but I won't hold you
'Cause there's nothing left to hold true

And all the chicks I'm with I don't love
Shit still getting harder for me when I'm trying to find it alone
But I know I'm supposed to be grown up
It might be time a nigga owned up for the shit I once did
Games that I once played, shit I once said
No one's turning back on me now
Don't turn your back on me now
I need you more than ever
You make me wanna put this TV off of sound
And pull these covers over us and take it slow forever
We go together, we so forever
Put the sunny in the stormy weather
I spent forever trying to figure out how I can fit up in your endeavors
You know I love you like a bow and arrow
Cupid shootin', who he aiming at?
Who laying the body down and where the statement at?
When love is lost who gonna show you where to claim it at?
You always told me you could show me how to claim it back, uh

Fargo, Estefan Fargo

Yeah, I heard word around town is I'm poppin' now
Bad bitch, recline my seat before she top me down
Just invested in two choppers and they on me now
Bitch, all you heard was 'grr grr' when I'm hoppin' out
Put them bitches in a Range Rove'
Hit a mission with my niggas, then I change clothes
Niggas runnin' for that paper-like Usain Bolt
You hit my bitch, I fuck your girl, that's how the game go
You know how that sayin' go
Girl, you know I'm poppin' off
Give me head and make sure you make that shit sloppy now
If you with it, you gon' meet me at the lobby now
Say you not, but girl, I know that you are probably down
Now what you talkin' 'bout?

What you talkin' 'bout?
Never do we get the time, but tonight feels right, yeah
What you talkin' 'bout?

New Toronto bitch, we ballin' on your blu-rays
I've been mobbin' round the city for like two days
Stashin' all this dirty money in the suitcase, woah

Don't you know that we got plenty choppers?
Any bitch inside my kitchen cook like Betty Crocker
Niggas say that they gon' rob me, bitch, don't make me stop you
Uncle Speedy, B.M.F., he down to let it drop you
They like...
Hit G Weed on the cellphone
Make that call from Compton, they'll be out on Melrose
Trained shooters and they down to touch the railroad
And they down to do you colder than the hail snow, woah
That shit tell you that I'm poppin' now
When I pull up in that Wraith, it ain't no talkin' now
Hater niggas talkin' payments but I bought it, wow
Reason why when I pull up, them bitches hoppin' out, yeah

You was talkin' shit but now you ridin' dick, you ain't slick
Why I keep a couple HO, HO's like I'm Saint Nick
I just got the Benzo back, you niggas outta luck though
You say that's your main girl, then why she tryna fuck for?
My chain on scammer, big T Montana
Withdraw like diamond, my bitch on Pamela
Came through on a hot block with the top drop and the diamonds
Stain blue on the hot block in a drop-top and I'm shinin'
Pocket rocket on me if a nigga wanna creep up on it with recliner
Starin' in my rear-view if a nigga tryna creep up on me from behind me
Certain niggas tryna text me
Play them niggas like a bass flute
All you niggas is some waste yutes
Boy I will come and erase you
Lookin' like I'm in the city slappin', cockin', clickin' up like I'm Nino
If he treat the forty-fifth it split him out and singin' to me like Selena

Oh no don't approach me
'Cause I got that thing on me, and that shit loaded
Hope you fuck niggas get shot all out your sneakers
Got some real niggas they watching from the bleachers
And you know my shooters don't come in no Ubers

Lay my head all on your stomach while you wear that Fenty, ayy
My thuggy, love me, love me
Give me cuddles, hold me snuggy
Don't you dub me, I just picked you up from Munchie's
Lookin' lovely, girl, I need you like a hustler gon' need his druggy

[Verse 1]
I get jaded feeling lonely, come and hold me
I need someone that really know me, and girl, you know me
Lay you down and let me stroke you slowly
But you told me sit it back inside that car while I was driving, and you did it lowkey, ayy

I fumble, try to rumble
Takin' shots to make her stumble
1942 all on the deck soon as you come through
One-two, one-two
If it's ever goin' down, you know who you can run to, yeah
My thugga, cocoa butter
That's my crime, that's my mob, that's my knuck-or-bucker

[Verse 3]
Look
We ain't talked in a long minute
Shit we used to do was authentic
Why we had to put our hearts in it?
Love came, put some scars in it
Feelings change, put some darts in it
Heart is changin', left me sharp-witted
Left the bike and left the bar spinnin'
Everybody play they parts in it
Justin dropped you straight into the crib
He be lowkey hatin' on the kid
You and Munchie drunk inside a ally
Been anticipatin' from the telly
Walked in the penthouse ready
Walked in the penthouse wavy
Finna put his dick off in her belly
Ride me like a motherfuckin' lady
House call to Jordyn Woods' house
Knocked out and woke up on the couch
Woke back and drove to your crib
This time I just know what it is
Next time the pool with you and Kylie
Hoped in it coolin', nigga wilin'
She was lookin' like a fuckin' angel
Lookin' like a baby in a manger
Hop step, went to the car
(Motherfucker, but, bitch, you got me fucked up)
Me and Kylie still off in the pool
We just chillin', kickin' shit, was cool
Both of us didn't know you was trippin'
Even though I got a crush on Kylie, I woulda left with you if I knew you was dippin' for the simple reason
You invited me but I can't act like shawty didn't excite me
I had took a wrong turn that-night
But not the turn that everybody think
I wasn't the wrong one that night, you was just too drunk to even see it
Wasn't anticipatin', I'd never put you in no situation
I've never even had an argument with ya
A conversation is all I'm bargainin' with ya
'Cause you was my nigga for real
And if you can agree, then you owe me that
Our mothers would tell us to do the right thing, and it's friendship, my nigga, you told me that
So even when niggas is comin' at me on they Twitter and Insta, I'm over that
'Cause what's a couple months of memes of me, if it means, I'm gon' get my homie back?
Fuck it, let's talk about it
Do you think anybody else inside of the business
That know they ain't did it would sit here and listen to critics
While niggas is trippin' and bashin' me?
Out here attackin' me, actually
Only reason why I let 'em do it, is 'cause I figured that you would've called a nigga
But look it's been over two months and all you did was stall, my nigga
The drama is bigger than ever
I thought that we both were bigger than that
Yeah, and the shit that I did, it was wack
But you don't get your nigga back like that
Just listen to Jigga on that one track
Song cryin' while it play in the back
I never cared to be that nigga in your fame shawty, I was playin' it back
We never had a thing, when we met each other, it was never a thing like that
Spendin' this time's what made us attached
Spendin' my time's what made you react
I'm only human, I gotta be real, and tell you, that the pain done came with that
Even the feelin' is strange at that
How you gon' up and just change the facts?
[Outro]
Hard to find your love (Find your love, baby)
When you walked away (When you are)
When I sleep, the thoughts of you don't stay away, no
Lost to love, what's up, babe? (Lost in love was somethin', baby)

Because these backwoods and these blunts are full of numb, huh
And all this Actavis and drank, it make me numb, huh
The only time I feel at peace is when I'm dumb high
I keep the flashy Jesus pieces when I stunt now
I keep a quarter-million pieces when I stunt now
Them dumb ass teachers and police said I'd be nothin', huh?
I ducked the Priest and chased my dreams and now his son's hot
That Wraith ain't rented, when I pull up man it's sun hot
I'm movin' geetchie with bitches, they be out buggin' now
Talkin' with opinions, all they got is opinions
I'm back and forth in millions, all y'all pussy niggas my minions
I spend days in Givenchy, Mama told me I would get it
I kept a .30 on me long and it had the extension
These niggas did me dirty, no I can't speak on friendship
I can't speak on this tension, spent most the year suspended

Take them heels off, walk inside my door, honey
Start to peel off, peelin' off them clothes for me

Why you playin'? What I'm sayin', just let Tory get you

Catch a nigga down Toronto, smokin' OG, nigga
Your bitch is fuckin' 'cause she want to fuck a OG, nigga

Used to sneak in, while yo' mom's sleepin'
We would play it off, like it's on TV
Riskin' it all up in these dark streets
Tellin' you I love you for the wrong reasons
Tellin' you I love you when they start squeezing
But really I just need somewhere to come creeping
I never meant wrong, but I could've been honest, I
I know I'm wrong but I, the 4 o'clock fall ins, all in the morning
Have me gwanin' and goin' in all for you, baby
I fell halfway for you, I did that thing for you
Made this pathway for two

Oops, I ain't mean it (Oops), I put it on her face
And gave her an all-white towel so she could clean it (Ew)
I'm Baby Jesus, sometimes I wear it once and give it away
Sometimes I hit the cleaners (Go!)
Who wanna get knocked out?
I'ma come burn a nigga, hot sauce
I'ma hoo, knock a nigga socks off
'Bout to cop a new drop, take the top off
Should I go get the 'Vette or the double R?
My momma gon' say, ""Goddamn, that's another car"" (Damn)
I got so many square feet inside of my mansion
There room in the bed for every one of y'all
Like fuck it, let's have a sleep over
Got your bitch suckin' dick, got her deep throatin'
No, we ain't doin' shows 'til Corona over
'Bout to take the trap back over, we open
I can make 50 songs 'fore the week over
Keep your bitch ass asleep if you sleep on me
Tryna figure which car I'ma drive today
Hit the gas 'til they call the police on me
Yeah, bitch, I—
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Hopped in the Scat, bitch, I'm back, where have you been? (Okay)
Fifty thousand dollars on my jack', goin' stupid (Okay)
Back outside, every time, it's a new fit (Okay)
Niggas love to lie, gotta tell 'em what the truth is (Okay)
Hopped in the Scat, bitch, I'm back, where have you been? (Okay)

[Intro]
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone

[Chorus]
Say baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin'

[Verse 1]
I called you on your phone, you sent my shit to message
This can't be what you're on
I knew somethin' was wrong
I'm not gon' lie, I had to creep up to your home
Even the neighbors is saying lately (You actin' kinda shady)
Girl, you think your slick but no (You ain't runnin' game)
Call my phone up just to tell me that (No one is around you)
Girl, that's a damn shame, I had to call, say what's up with your day?
Mumble in your voice, heard that tremble in your cadence
Every single word seems to hit a nerve
'Cause you keep saying ""umm uhh 'kay""
Won't you say
[Chorus]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say my fuckin' name
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game

When no one is around you, say baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my

[Verse 2]
Where you at and who you with?
Open up, I'm at your crib, girl
You better tell me where you at
You say (over with my clique)
But I just called up Keisha and Lisa
Sayin' that they didn't even see ya
Better tell me where you are (Just got in the house)
How could you be inside if you was just ridin'?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold the fuck up
Who's, who's that in the back (Voice of someone else)
Girl, I know you're lying, you should quit while you're ahead
Instead of arguin' and whinin', I could see it

Say my fuckin' name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say my fuckin' name
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Say my name, say my fuckin' name

[Outro]
Know the girls say, all my girls say
And the girls say
Know the girls say and the girls say
And the girls gon' say
What they gon' say?
They say
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there then tell me who7Embed"

And come put that kitty cat on me
Oh, no, oh, yeah
You got a hold on me
Let’s talk about it, baby, I know you 'bout it, baby
I know you got a man, you know I got a lady
I know the thought of us fuckin', shawty, it's kinda crazy
Even the thought of me sayin' that shit is soundin' crazy
Ooh, back it up, let me smoke it, drag it up
You be wantin' me every time that I'm rollin’, actin’ up

You're not threatened by a good time whenever we're kissin' (Oh)

Wish a bitch would try hatin'

I fuck her like a rude boy, baby
And If I ever throw this at you
Better catch it like you knew Tom Brady
I'm in the mood for some whoosah, baby
Good head on her like whoosah. baby
I see the future
Me and you fucking in the bedroom
Now tell me what you saw, baby
Shawty tell the truth, I'm wavy
Stars in the ceiling, baby, roof goin' crazy
Swimming in it, I feel like I live in the Matrix, baby
That pussy A-list, red-bottom, baby
New Celine on you, you deserve a whole news crew and team on you
You and me is looking like the Eulogy

Put my taste in your face
Choose on trip like your second set of lips
Put your juice on my stick, first, let me get a sip
Quick, no Trick Daddy, but daddy got dollars
Ain't that why you wanna be my baby momma?
No kiss, is that something you can swallow
Got her leg shaking like my vibrato
When I put it all in, no lie, I think I'm fallin'
Drive me crazy with no hands
Goin' HAM, no romance or slow jams
Goddamn, with the waves in your ocean
This the ride of your life, rollercoaster
Took a ride on the pipe, water flowing
Got your eyes looking blind, how they rollin'
Keep you cumming every time that we go in
Talking dirty and that pussy well spoken
Death Row that pussy, I'm West Coastin'
Pray for niggas that's less fortunate
Slay all day, I'm that focused (I like it)

Had her in the sheets, finna cut her like a DJ
Fifteen bottles like a quince

Said it two times, then I jinxed it
Saw right through me, had a cup full of lies as I drinked it, uh

I stunt so hard, I stuff credit cards in Goyards
Your face, no flaws, no case, no charge
Pulled up in BMs, we spendin' daily per diems
From AM to the PM, you would hop inside my bed
Get it wetter than, what's that line? Uh
Spray 'em where you see 'em
That's why I'm payin' no attention to chicks, I'm playin' in my DM
I know dropout Rovers, pop out sofas
Was with me when I wasn't eatin', we would pop out Stouffer's
You see, that's why I'm still fuckin' with you
Head down, ten toes, still thuggin' with you (Word)
Takin' long flights out to DR
I'm still in Palos, back to Caicos
Trips for the chick that swing them hips like Miss Juegos
From questions like, ""How'd your day go?""
I spend it, extended the suite another week
In Dego, just to watch the day go
As far as bankroll, bank go
I can speak for it with the trips like sprain on ankle
I keep mami on everyone of 'em, shit, I'm sonnin' 'em
Niggas talkin' crazy to bae, I point the gun at 'em
Super hell shit pop up, dun-dun-dun at 'em
Was with me back when I was broke, and so I run it up
Anything for you, I swerve in the lane for you
Hop in the drop top, still work in the rain for you
Nurture this pain for you
'Cause even days that it ain't workin'
I'm still lurkin' and hurtin', in pain for you
See the art was I was shootin' from the heart
But what's shootin' from the heart with a worthless aim for you?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
But I can hear your heart, it's crying out for me
And if it tears apart, take my worst flaws, that's on it
You should have never doubted
Now you can't live without me
You should have never doubted
Now you can't live without me

You should have never doubted (You should have never, no)
Now you can't live without me (Yeah, yeah)

Everywhere around town, now you're crying out for me
'Cause I hit it right, the way you like that (Yeah)

You wanted new shoes and a Bimmer
Back in the day, we were the two that would team up
Martin and Gina
You know the truth, but you seen a few, how you doin'?
I see your point of view when I need to
I won't lose sleep over this, no
Got me jumpin' out the window, fourty-fifth floor
Moods that you get me, babe
Things that I did to you, this is you gettin' me back
And I need more to love you
I've been prayin' that some peace gonna come through
How you gon' be my enemy when I love you?
You know I need your energy when you come through
You knew I found love when I seen you
Seein' you was somethin' that I ain't never seen before
But I seen the beach shore, you was all aboard my marina
Demeanor, scale of one to ten, 15

Fuck with a nigga head, no good reason
Dress real spiffy anytime, it's pool season
Shawty get a kick outta fuckin' 'em and leavin'
You want a nigga that  appreciate ya
Have him rollin', then you go and put your skates on

Appreciate a nigga make we wanna do somethin'

New friends become dangerous
Never does it ever let me down
'Til you have real friends
'Til you have real friends
I got my drank poured
I got these Js rolled up
No need to change clothes
I'll be fine in what I got on
Keep meetin' new hoes
And fuckin' the same ho once
I tried to move on
And end up right back inside this position
[Part 2: New Foes]

[Verse]
I got a million ties
Suit talk like Tom Ford when I top back in the five
So alive I could die right now, come back still alive
You was fake with the handshake, now you come back stealing fives
Only One Umbrella mob
Left her by her grandmama crib and then I went back to the ways
Went back to the field, had to hit it, step back for the plays
Step back with a 10 pack, made 10 rack for the day
Impact, don't play
Been strapped since pin strap now I sit back on the Wraith
Damn, look how shit changed
Couldn't see it back then, now you say you seein' what I been saying
Chick from the Himalayas, na-na-na-na-na
When I walk up in the buildin', all you hear is
""Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy!""
Didn't love me at the bottom
But they wanna love a nigga at the top though
Innocent, since Pac, now I got the bald head with the Pac flow
Neck lookin' like Pablo with the ki's stuffed in the Tahoe
Been licked since I blow out in Oslo with my eyes low
Said I got a million ties
You got a million ways to get it, well, I got a milly and five
I really will donate a mill to my city, it's gettin' too real to survive
Only the trillest survive
You don't wanna get caught up in this situation when all of my niggas arrive
I'm back in the biddy, countin' 100, 20, 50, like this Kinder Surprise
I open this shit up but see a surprise, when really it ain't a surprise
This shit just come to me naturally
Women in love with me naturally
She told you that she never fucked me
But she was just fuckin' me actually
Top down, top down
I'm hot now, hot now
Lot of rap and R&B niggas popped off my sound
Then I hit 'em with the southpaw, switch and they all dropped down
Cropped out, cropped out
They got me over the blog, me and Dream dollar bill
Rumors that we dated, gotta be faker than a three dollar bill
I might just walk in this Starlets, just to show you that the star lit
Add a bad bitch, market
Martin tell, kept ten shots next time that I get the ball lit
Wardrobe, crib callin', new shit that I'm on, it's
Yeah, tell 'em boys that the squad lit
All 100s, all green-blue, you swear I'm playin' for the Hornets
But I'm playin' for the T City and the Umbrella team with me
I got a million ties, pretty Brazilian wives
Come to my city and see how the shooters is takin' civilian lives
I been out there in the field with 'em, so who am I to pick a side?
Just 'cause I got legitimized, to hypocrite and criticize16Embed"

Break your love
I never meant to break your love
Break your love
I never meant to break your love

[Verse 1]
Got love for everyone in the business
But everyone in my business
Tell me, how should I talk when everyone is a witness?
And every slur out your mouth can turn into someone's sentence
That turn into somethin' later, that turn into somethin' vicious
And vicious niggas is after yo' timе, turnin' yo' switches
Your friends swervin' yo' bitchеs and then burnin' your bridges
You stuck and severed in thoughts of when it's all gonna end
When the ending's harder than thoughts
Or when it starts, it begins
Nobody wins when the family feud
Or when the family news turns into somethin' that no one from the family choose
Or when you plan to choose it, it's a dub for the feat
When they play they move
When the plans change and you plan to expand, pannin' the views
And these R&B singer women you called, all your friends choose
Kehlani hops on the news like it was somethin' to prove
Like me and her wasn't cool when I been friends with you for six years
Plus, plus the crew and we can Google picture proof
Got my phone number too, you coulda called me
But you movin' like we ain't even crew, and you'd not rather hear my views?
We used to phone talk late about exes and all our pools
I held your newborn in my arms, tell me how we aren't cool
Instead, you went to Twitter Shade Room to focus on your views
You was the quickest one to take me off records and set the mood
And now you got these little garbage artists talkin' like they takin' me off somethin'
That's gon' harm me, your label paid me already, dude
But KK, back to you, let me tell you who's
How to move, this is what you do
If you wanna take that stance, then that's cool
But we gon' do this with some rules
Ayy, JoJo, I need you to take notes too
Don't take me off the deluxe album that no one gives a fuck about
Take me off the original too
'Cause when I'm scrollin' through this Spotify playlist
See me my name both in y'all top five pages
It just feels a little unsincere, hmm?
Or maybe I refuse, am I trippin' and confused?
Y'all could have took me off the album but have still have yet to do?
Ayy, nah, maybe it's the truth
Got the numbers and the proof
'Cause with both of y'all combined, I gave y'all forty million views
Y'all can't lose
What do you do when your friends lookin' at you sideways?
I can't even tell 'em what happened because of my case
You can't even trust in nobody 'cause they might try face
All the G's tellin' you, OG, this isn't my day
Y'all can dub and hurt me but I'm fueled by a God
Tender love and mercy, devil tryna work me
But I pop up in the scene, chocolate car, color Hershey
It's some niggas that I lent money to that never imbursed me
[Pre-Chorus]
I had many visions of this time, made decisions for the prime
Future thinkin' how I'm speakin' on the past like, ""What a time""
Once upon a time, was just a kid that loved to rhyme
And now the fame is bittersweet, I take the cake that come with mine, Tory

[Chorus]
Is it worth it?
When everything that's bittersweet isn't perfect
Lookin' beyond the surface
And I can see the greatest go away
I never meant to break your heart
(I never meant to break your heart, no)
I never meant to break your heart, no
Look

[Verse 2]
I know I'm swingin' with the excalibur sword, calibers in the drawer
Copped me a brand new Cullinan, calendars lookin' for him
My balance fully attended, two talents full on the floor
My palace is full of awards, my shower is like the Falls
I'm serious
And my aim is never beef with my peers
When niggas careers like the game with the seat with the chairs
When the music goes off and you left sittin', seein' who's there
Yeah, niggas don't even compare
It hurt to say them words 'bout Roc Nation management
'Cause Jigga whole career, I've been a fan of it
And I'm just pissed 'bout how these niggas handled it
I worked for this for years
And outta nowhere, here comes Jill tryna come smear campaign and damage it
Like she hit me with the ""Oh, well""
But I know this so well
I'm colder than a polar bear's toenail in my hotel
Got thick strippers gettin' motorboated in a motel
Made videos and TMZ'll pay me just to go sell
I don't like to do this, y'all just act like I ain't human
Been two months and seein' me on memes and I ain't suppose to do shit?
Oh, I get it, y'all think I'm stupid
I'm supposed to lose to these lies
Tellin' rumor and sellin' niggas that feudin'
And talkin' to GOAT, never with they chest but all with they throat
It's like you can only trust these niggas as far as you throw
As far as it goes, the check, cards in the wallet
Console still got these bitches tryna swallow me whole
You know me
Shawty said I can't be canceled 'cause I'm far too handsome
I hopped up out that yellow Lamb', her man start a tantrum
The bands fallin' over me just like a starvin' dancer
But take that up with the man who decide to harness answers
I know God got me, I know God got me
The car frame in two lanes, it's a wide body
She'd rather fuck me in her brain but try to side eye me
Them Flower City niggas with me, homie, why try me?
Crack the seal on the weed, still on the speed
Watch critics create meme with zero chill on my feed
They never expected me to react actually
But fuck it, that's that nigga, I'm back to bein' me
But I wonder if we'll talk again
Wonder if we'll run up on Runyon Canyon at 9 o'clock at night and take that walk again
Even if you don't, I still consider you my friend
And the greater that it came, is still the bigger that it is
In my darkest days, sittin' at the pillar countin' scrilla
Chinchilla jacket like Tony at the villa
Not only am I richer than these fuck ass rap niggas, I'm realer
And I'm down to put that work in until you feel him
[Pre-Chorus]
Shotta had many visions of this time, made decisions for the prime
Future thinkin' how I'm speakin' on the past like, ""What a time""
Once upon a time, was just a kid that loved to rhyme
Now the fame is bittersweet, I take the cake that come with mine, Tory

[Chorus]
Is it worth it?
When everything that's bittersweet isn't perfect
Lookin' beyond the surface
And I can see the greatest flow away

We got London on da Track

[Verse 1]
Shawty, you ain't gotta lie to me
You got a nigga on the side, don't you?
You can open up your mind to me, uh
You can open up them thighs to me, uh
But it seems that you fall that way
Always seems to fall that way
'Cause this shit was so hard that way
You still my bitch even when I don't call you that name
12k jet life for that plane
Bape sweats on like 4-5 days
Two shows and I got more to my day
Now you need me, what more can I say?
To you 'cause I, got shit on my mind
And I'm all down for takin' time
But I'm not gon' let you think that

[Chorus]
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I got unforgetful, I got unforgetful
I never got to tell you
Things I forgot to tell you
I'm not forgetful, I'm not forgetful
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the first dates
I remember the first days
And the worse days and the worse case
The only thing I can't remember is how I got right here in the first place
I remember the, uh yeah, I re-, wait
Don't think that I got forgetful
[Verse 2]
Better have time for me
Bet the next time that I see you
I'ma have somethin' much better than a line for you
Or a rhyme for you
Keep on puttin' you on in all of my songs
'Til you get around to me
Girl, you been down and you stayed around
It's time I put this shit down on you
Let's meet then, baby
Girl, I'm really busy on the weekday
Shawty, be my weekend, lady
Kill the pussy like a horror film
That's what you call freakin', baby
Got some new songs but I heard you like fuckin' to The Weeknd
And we can, get to freakin' in my new motherfuckin' Wraith
And you heard I got the stars in the roof though
Two tone went and got that shit two door
Askin' what the fuck I'm gon' need a new hoe for
When she got the pussy pinker than some nuvo
Hoes like to tell me they love and yeah I might listen
But them hoes ain't worth the time
I be so focused on you, and you know that it's true
And you came at the perfect time
Sorry if...

Dance 'til the mornin' and clock out
Strippers stealin' money from your locker
I've got some bitches and some options
But you the one, I always pop out for you
Left side the bar, I'm out there fuckin' faded
Ain't anticipate the cab ride home, but we fuckin' made it
Sippin' '42, and Hennessy, and fuckin' Jägers
That's the reason why we got so dangerous
I fuckin' hate you, I mean, I love you but I fuckin' hate you
But why the fuck you make me feel like we'd be fuckin' major?
I never meant to make you feel like I would underrate you
I'll be sittin' by this table, I'm so unstable
Somewhere by the bleachers, smokin', puffin' weed
Teachers never gave a fuck, they was paid to show up and leave
Marijuana on my sleeve
JV, practiced varsity, I didn't make it on the team
So I started sellin' nicks and dimes and all these twenty beams
Anyting or anyting, dub sacks and duffle bags
Hennessy and triple beams
Shawty said she fuckin' love me, came around and sold me dreams
I was skatin' on a thot like a fuckin' rollin' rink
Sellin' dope like it's my only thing
If we get caught, that chromie swing if crodie sing
Lawyer fightin' cases for the team, we got forty rings
Champagne by the cases, I came in with like forty tings
I split the scene like the splits in my jeans
Split in my seams, I'm gettin' money, ain't it?
No one was there to hold you down when it was cloudy
But they show up when it's sunny, ain't it?
And it pours rain on my umbrella but this one I got's forever, oh
I hope it was fun, me and yo' best friend, we had a thing but that was something
She real as fuck, you could've told her but you dead wrong
Instead you left her out for dead, girl, is your head gone?
Fuck is the loyalty?
Tell me, who the fuck taught you your loyalty?
How you try to fuck me and then foil me?
Poppin' up in places that you know I'll be
I done kept this shit so real, you owe me
I done kept this shit so real, you know me
How you movin' like I'm not the only?
How you movin' like I left you lonely?
How you movin' like I'm not the homie?
[Outro]
Yes, I thought you would've been more loyal, loyal to me
Yes, I thought you would've been more loyal, loyal to me
And I told everyone that you were loyal, now the joke's on me
The joke's on me, I told everyone that you were the one, the joke's on me
And you let them laugh, makin' jokes of me
I told my exes I'd make you my girl, now the joke is on me
I told the people I love that you were the one, now the joke is on me
Oh, I'm ashamed, joke's on me
Oh, I'm ashamed, the joke's on me

Part II

[Verse 2]
Me and the homie pull off the corner
Inside of a old Honda Accord
The feeling felt like a torture
The nigga that we just robbed just popped one in his shoulder
It led to me pulling over, to check him and tell him, dawg
Just take the passenger seat and I'll hit the road
'Cause it's way too many police out here to feel like we low
My back windshield broke and the driver seat soaked
From the blood that was previously leaking from his coat
We switch sides while I put this shit to drive
At 80 some odd miles, I'm shiftin the gear to 5
Hopin' that them 5-0 pigs don't see the ride
'Cause normally I ain't scared, tonight it's fear in my eyes
My phone blingin' 'cause my girl at home clingin'
And unaware of the problem this night on the road bringin'
Then I pick up the phone and tell her I'm speedin' home
As soon as I drop my dawg at the emergency room17Embed"

You got ya mind rocked, rollin' down Loners Blvd
You've got dreams, keep on dreaming

[Verse 1]
High school team, never got accepted
Guess it didn't get to go how I expected
Now a nigga pissed
Steady lookin' at the bottom of the list like
""Where the fuck are my projections?""
Niggas like, ""Next year Tory
It's all good, you'll be next year's story""
Then I said ""Man, you don't even understand
Man, I'm droppin' out now, win it next year for me""
So I left, bus route to the bench down 53
Took the last dollar that I had for this dream
And I spent it on some 99 cents Micky D's
Shit wasn't doin' too fine
Then I made a call to this nigga named Rimes
Said he had a little studio and it wasn't top-notch
But could damn near do the whole nine
So I said ""Cool,"" made a few songs in this shit
Stayed too long in this shit
But by the month, man, I was there so much niggas had to lay futons in this shit
Owe it to my aunt Suzanne
Drove to my first shows in your new Jetta
Always said one day I would be the man
I would just laugh like, ""Who are you tellin', me?""
I'ma go far
I could still dream in this world full of stars
I could still scheme in this world full of narcs
If they could still scheme in them unmarked cars, so
I'ma dream, I'ma dream, dream
I'ma dream, dream like you said to me
Best words that was said to me
Best words that was said to me
[Chorus: Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Ten long miles, from a long way home
I'm headed downtown 'cause I'm workin' on this lil' mixtape
No fillers, no throwaway songs
Hopin' that this shit just go
Sadly for me, this shit didn't
So I make another mixtape and another mixtape and another mixtape
'Til them niggas start sayin' shit's hittin'
Then I meet a guy named Sascha
Tells me he's thinkin' 'bout takin' up management
Say he got a million dollar empire on his mind, he just need the artist to plan it with
He also say he throw shows out in Texas and maybe I should open up for one
And I say ""Cool man,"" he books me the next flight out like I'm showin' up for somethin'
I land down in Houston around nine, warehouse live
Was my worst show ever
Niggas damn near got booed off stage
I performed like my first show ever
Women in the crowd wouldn't scream for a nigga
Niggas in the crowd they was kotched up down
Bad enough niggas let Bun B watch
But I felt like I let Sascha down, this shit was live on stage, dog
That night felt like a nigga had the whole world on my shoulders
Twenty years old tryna find a warm spot in this world gettin' colder
Then he came to me like, ""Dog, I could put money on this, bet a hundred on this""
Gives me a few tips for the next night setlist
Says, ""Dog, you gon' run it on this"" and it all works out
[Chorus: Instrumental]

[Outro]
It's a big world
The bigger your dream, the bigger you're livin' it
It's all in your mind
Don't let nobody fuck up your high
It's a big world
The bigger your dream, the bigger you're livin' it
It's all in your mind
Don't let nobody fuck up your high
