We go back, remember criss-cross and hopscotch? (Hopscotch)
You the one that hold me down when the block's hot (Hot)
I make your dreams come true when you wake up (Dream)
And your look's just the same without no make-up (Bad)
Had to pull up on your mama, see what you're made of (Mama)
Ain't gotta worry 'bout 'em commas 'cause my cake up (Cake)
You can run inside my life from that fame bus (Skrrt)

Then she went and put that booty on that Gucci belt
We don't got no label
She say she want bottles, she ain't got no table
She don't got no bed frame, she don't got no tables
We just watchin' Netflix, she ain't got no cable, okay though

'Cause I've been lookin' for somebody
Not just any fuckin' body
Don't make me catch a body
That's for any and everybody
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response
Bitch, you blow my high
That's like turnin' gold to bronze, roll my eyes
And when she on the molly, she a zombie
She think we Clyde and Bonnie
But it's more like Whitney and Bobby
God, forgive me! Tunechi F finessin', I'm a legend
Straight up out the Crescent
Fly your bae down for the Essence
For the record I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records
Mula Gang, winnin' record
I'm just flexin' on my exes, oh God

Yeah, I go on and on
Can't understand how I last so long
I must have the superpowers
Last two-hundred twenty-three thousand hours
And it's 'cause I'm off of CC
And I'm off the Hennessy
And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain't free
I got girls that I shoulda made pay for it
Got girls that I shoulda made wait for it
I got girls that'll cancel a flight back home
Stay another day for it
You got attitude on na-na
And your pussy on agua
And your stomach on flat-flat
And your ass on ""What's that?""
And, yeah, I need it all right now
Last year I had drama, girl, not right now
I was never gon' chat what we talkin' about
You the only one I know could fit it all in her— man
[Chorus: Drake]
I always wonder if you ask yourself (Ask yourself)
Is it just me? (Just me)

Fuck for free
I know you workin' day and night to get a college degree
Bet nobody that you've been with even know you a freak, right?
You know you only do that with me, right?
Yeah, double checkin' on you
You know I never put the pressure on you
You know that you make your own mind up
You knew what it was when you signed up
Now you gotta run it up
I be out of words, tryna sum it up
Girl, you throw it back like one love
Even let me slash on the tour bus
Yeah, I talk to her but she don't do enough
Even though you in the hood, I'm still pullin' up
Dip, dip, straight to your doorstep
This the real thing, can you feel the force yet?

Ugh, I'm getting so throwed
I ain't went this hard since I was eighteen
Apologize if I say anything I don’t mean
Like, ""What's up with your best friend?
We could all have some fun, believe me""
And, ""What's up with these new niggas?
And why they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Tripping off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fucking allegations
I’m just feeling like the throne is for the taking—watch me take it

Walking on the clouds, suspended in thin air (Yeah)
The ones beneath me recognize the red bottoms I wear (Check it)
Burner in the belt, move the kids to the hills (Boss)
Bend shawty on the sink, do it for the thrill
Kiss you on your neck and tell you, ""Everything is great"" (Right)
Even though I'm out on bond and might be facing eight
Still running with the same niggas 'til the death of me
Never seen a million cash, gotta count it carefully (Haha)
Ever made love to the woman of your dreams (Woo!)
In a room full of money out in London as she screams? (Woo!)
Huh! Baby, I could take it there
Call Marc Jacobs personally to make a pair

Yeah, too much money ain't enough money
You know the feds listening—nigga, what money?

You niggas on the bench, like the bus coming
Huh, ain't nothing sweet but the Swishers
I’m focused, might as well say ""cheese"" for the pictures
Ohh, I’m about to go Andre the Giant

Put an end to your world like the Mayans

Meanwhile Georgie Porgie Cinnamon sendin' me threats
Save your breath, you couldn't beat a flight of steps
Try that shit with a grown man
I'll kill that fuckboy with my own hand
And hop back in the coupe (Woo, woo)
Let's go back to the mud, I'll hop right out the suit
Save all that woopty-woop
Let's let the money talk, let the Uzi shoot
No jewels in this Patek Philippe
It's complicated, three million apiece
Sheesh, that's how we do time
Dujac by the mag, that's how we do wine
91 thousand for a wine bill
Keep it real with you, that was Juan's bill
My whole team ball
Everybody's a star but the team ball
'61 with the thing off
Me and Blue havin' a sing-off
That's a raspberry beret
The kind you find in a second-hand store
That's a vintage piece
Kind that make haters kiss their teeth, you can't buy this new

Fuck it up and then leave, come back, fuck it up and leave again
Top off the coupe and it look like Freaknik
In the hood, hollerin', ""Free Meek""
Two deep, it's just me and Jay

DJ Khaled

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust (uh huh)
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust (come on)
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said ""Fuck Mother Earth,"" that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
[Chorus: Betty Wright & DJ Khaled]
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine

And he took a couple trips, then it's dinner and a Myx
And he's never with no other chick, fronting like he's slick
'Cause it's levels to this shit, and she could never be Nic
Niggas be fallin' in love with this pussy
Mean stew chicken, and bake him a couple of cookies
Dick on veteran, ain't fucking with rookies
Saw the High School video now he wanna play hookie
Baddest bitch, I'm the catalyst
Ain't never been done, bitch I added this
Nah, I ain't gotta shoot, I got mad assists
'Bout to put a couple pieces on the mannequin

At the Trump, and you bitches at the Radisson
Got the .22 on me, and it's thin

If you take a taxi, how much I owe ya?
Don't send me no naked pictures
If I can't get naked with ya
This dick deserve recognition

You've been drinkin' and drinkin', you're drinkin' for fun
And you drink for a reason
Yeah, leave your boyfriend and call me when you're leavin'
Callin' shots, refereein', no drama
Pussy so wet, I'ma need Dramamine and mattress Aquafining

I'm signin' new artists, I sell out arenas
Swimmin' with the dolphins on the Dan Marino
Wine mixin', this shit like the Catalina
B-I-G, minus Puff and Lil Cease
I'm on my grind, 3 AM text like I need ya
Dream about the pussy, fuck it, I'm a dreamer
Hold me down but don't hold me back like I need you to, damn
I wrote myself a million dollar check in fifth grade
I put it on the wall and promised it'd be this way
She fuck me like she want the rent paid
Like she want that Oscar De La Renta
I slow it down like it's her favorite ballad
Then go back up at it like I hadn't had it
Straight up

In town, in town, for the weekend, oh

[Verse 3: Chris Brown & DJ Khaled]
I see these bitches in Supperclub
Niggas got me throwin' bottles up
Bottles with all of my homies
I'm feelin' generous, throwin' my money
She said she wanted the molly love
I gave her the dick but I'm not in love
I call out, ""Bingo!"" the minute I'm bonin'
Soon as I'm done, kick her out in the mornin'
Got Xans when I turn up, it's a party, bust it open
Pop that pussy in a circle, go retarded, pop it for me
She got that booty galore, grippin' it, backin' me up
You wanna fuck with a thug
Now I see all these bitches got ass and they throwin'
Damn, it's just a matter of time 'fore I'm gone
Drinkin' Ciroc and I know that she got it for free
I hit up Diddy, he told me he did it
He said that the liquor just bring out the freaks
Them bitches lit, droppin' that ass to a split
Talkin' 'bout me, I'm the shit
I just get down for the money, the bitches, and cars
And my niggas, they whippin' the bricks, huh

And cry every night, you stay, you stay
I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
I think you too loyal, you stay, you stay

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, I don’t know how you do it, but you did it, I'll admit it
And who am I to be a critic and tell you different?
You know I never speak on that nigga, it's not my business
But I could tell you that his level’s no competition
And I'm optimistic that I'm 'bout to hit it
And um, I can tell you've been crying in Honda Civics
Because I caught you slipping, left you no choice
You ever cry again, it's gon' be in a Rolls Royce
I wipe your face with them new hundreds to make your tears dry
Hitting it on a jet, this ain't no red eye
Got you chasing dreams, and it ain’t even bedtime
And don’t you dare bring up your ex 'cause he a dead guy
I wonder
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side
If he makes you cry every night?
Girl, I see the pain in your eyes
I don’t know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
You stay, tell me why you

[Verse 2: Jeremih & DJ Khaled]
I think you're too loyal
I think you do too much for someone who don't do shit for you, girl
And that's real
That ain’t the way love supposed to feel
But you say he's the one for you
Then complain how he don't show you
But you ain't gotta take that
Baby, you can't take that
Hit the gym and get your shape back, oh
Fuck that nigga
Don't understand why you still trust that nigga (Work)
With your mind and your heart and your soul (Let's go)
For your goals, in control, you let it go (Work)
I just want to see you happy
I just want to see you laughing
I just want to see you smiling
I can tell you need somebody who really about you
Who gon' see about you
'Cause it's been a while, so baby

Why, oh, why? (Oh, why?)
Do you ride, do you stick by his side

I don't know why, oh, why, you stay, you stay, oh
You stay, you stay
I think you too loyal

[Verse 3: Lil Baby & J Balvin]
You give him chance after chance
'Cause you say maybe one day, he'll grow up and be a man
And lately, you been pouring out your heart on the 'Gram
But you been playing your part from the start, I understand
I put carats on your hand
But see, I'm one of them bad guys
And I can't guarantee the world
But I promise you'll be better than last time
As long as you're loyal
You got a plan, I'll do more than spoil
I'll be there to support you
Drop top in the wintertime, whatever just to see you smile
Private jet from time to time, by the ocean, I'll drive you wild
Whatever your decision, I'm with it, no asking why
I catch you slippin' at all, you gon' be mine (J Balvin, men; ¡wuh!)

You know the pick and roll, I picked her up and sent her home
I got rich off strong, we get ’em in and get 'em gone
You know Trappy just got out, I ain't have to put him on
We the ones who got the numbers, who put the city on
It’s the middle of the summer, I got a hoodie on
My demon time ain't nothin' nice
I try not to wear nothin' twice
I came up off of shootin' dice, yeah
My lil' brother ain't livin' right
My sis’ and ’em doin' aight
My cuz and ’em still servin' life, yeah
Seen a robber rob a deacon
I seen a preacher get caught for cheatin'
I'll break the bank for one of my people

[Verse 1: Nas]
A divine leader, shine brighter, bonita mami meeter
Line sniffer, never, poetic rhyme writer, chiefer
Ebony empress getter
Celebrity Apprentice a devil show, big up to Africa, Mexico
Hennessy, margarita, venison eater
So dear, spread 'em here, don't be actin' innocent either
Dome me, relax me, it's only to the nasty
I'm just a phony assassin, a lot of niggas owe me, I'ma tax 'em
A lot of sisters hold me to somethin' holy and Catholic
‘Cause the rosary and gold flashy
Just an attachment and accessory to my dress code
Now everywhere all I see is Pablo, Esco
Last time I checked I was still breathin', my neck was still freezin'
Now everybody got an Escobar Season
To every baby on the album cover existin'
This trend I was settin', it came to fruition
I'm assistin' to push the culture forward
To all my ghost supporters, go support us
Like a local Black-owned grocery store
‘Cause in the hood shit ain't passed down through blood
It's a dub on that, we get government aid
Spend it at they stores, puttin' they kids through college
We need balance so we can lease and own deeds in our projects
So I'm askin' Gs to go in their pockets
The racial economic inequality, let's try to solve it
[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key

[Verse 2: Nas]
Still underestimated, every mistake a lesson
Mercury retrograde, so if that planet spin backwards
Up in the heavens maybe
It's effectin' back on niggas who don't be reppin' lately
I'm playin' chess with babies, niggas is nursery
Niggas impersonatin', rehearsin' me
Nothin' like me, I'm the first of me and that's quite certainly
So official, come get this issue, some women crazy
I like a woman to show me wisdom
These hoes easily convinced to pop their pussy
With a loaded pistol; y'all ain't meant to be played
Says the brother with the signature fade
Still paid, stackin', new stash
Went from hangin' with shooters and clappers
To computer hackers, check the fashion in Monaco
Gettin' ocean mist on my HSTRY hats
Khaled called me when I was in album mode
So I put it on hold for the Major Key
My album done, niggas, wait and see
[Interlude: DJ Khaled]
Classic shit, timeless, forever, iconic

[Chorus: Nas]
My signature fade with the Bevel blade, that's a major key
I told her she smart and loyal, I like that, that's a major key
Start a label, run it, sign yourself, that's a major key
What Tony had on the table, it's like us, we a major key31Embed"

This shit's special

[Verse 1: Scarface]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories—she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind, so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now, the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to kill you
I built my whole life around you
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel? I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the Sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone, you don't look at it the same, man
Fuck love, 'cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood, but I'm still here
Hip-hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s, plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and let you—
Get away, now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the colleges, professors
Now, I regret the day I met ya (Bitch)
I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked hip-hop
[Verse 2: Nas]
And if— And if— And if— And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason, Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today, I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap—to this bitch, you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her Vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love—word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her WorldStar
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings
Made some friends resent me for writing about my life
They thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would've never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, ugh, hallowed be Thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her, used to ride her—for dollars, not for fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second
Then, I screamed, ""She's dead!""
And everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her—she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck hip-hop
[Scratch Outro 1: DJ Premier]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I would I give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit
I fucked hip-hop
And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most I can give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
I fuck hip-hop
And you all know how the story go

Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?

I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)
[Verse: J. Cole]
Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say ""Fuck that shit"" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes, there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Said all that I could say, now I play with thoughts of retirement
[Chorus: J. Cole]
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?

The block is at war, post traumatic stress

If we believe enough, will we ever get to know him?
That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen

Look, look

A miscarriage back-to-back every year for like ten
Pregnant with my moms, doctor told her it was slim
Was bed rode for nine months, but gave birth in the end

In one generation, he came from Africa young
He said he met my moms at the Century Club
Los Angeles love kinda of like Hussle and Boog

Startin' to see this life shit from a bird's view
We the ones that made millions off the curb, fool

Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (Nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Point it at your head, got the bread then you blacked out
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like you seein' a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't tryna stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing round-ups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now I'm stunned thinkin ""Fuck that"" (Fuck that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (Get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz
[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats, they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him, you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love, the hurt's pure
When you front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
You was right there back-to-back with me my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz 'em in then meet 'em right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead, you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'bout what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzers
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches
[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton & Meek Mill]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh oh (Yeah, for life)
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six Os in the bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up, I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm tryna get full, mask on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft and sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon & John Legend]
My pain ain't never been told (Ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (This knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (In my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day
[Chorus: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around (Nobody's around)
Cold world (Cold world) cold world (Mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (Always take you down)
Cold world (Cold) a cold, cold world

[Chorus: Akon & Anthony Hamilton]
'Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender)
Surrender to you (Surrender to you, which I will never do)
Oh-ohh, oh-whoa
Oh-ohh (oh-ohh) oh-ohh

Started in Atlanta then I spread out with it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter
On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jacksonville, Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn; holla at me
Be in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland, daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled
Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop 6-4, three-wheel, then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches
Got a Glock four-fifth, blow your head off with it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off with it
Say you need bricks, I said, ""I'll get it""
[Pre-Chorus: Akon]
If you want to, we can supply you (Supply you)
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to (Try to)

Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
I'd rather get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come runnin' like water

Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress

They'll come back quick if a nigga OD
Cash rule everything around me
I'm YSL, Versace
You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset, sittin' on Ds
Feelin' like Pac, all eyes on me
Fresh bandana and I'm blowin' mad trees (Trees, trees)

Nigga came at me wrong, so we got him done
Fuckin' with the fam, I'ma give him some

Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
Why'd they have to send my baby home?
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game, now my son on the throne

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Ah, I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
I'm untamed, I need a leash
I'm insane, I need a shrink
I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on Easy Street?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter pink
And my wrist-wear Chopard but the Müller's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor
Red light, red light, stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big kahuna, y'dig?

And you know it don't stop, grindin' 'round that clock
Masterminding my second album, my first album just dropped
Scored a touchdown on my first down, niggas thought I was gon' flop
See I hustle like my momma but I look just like my pops, ha
And we still duckin' cops, ride around and take shots
Hennessy for my enemies, niggas know I'm takin' they spot
'Cause that score up on the play clock show just how I came from way back
Just like T-I-P told you—ASAP; but you niggas rappin' like Aesop, Aesop, get a grip!

And if anyone ever doubt it, then they are the loudest of liars I know

And I hope that my dick is a whistling flute, and that's not the instrumental
Now pick up my coat
You let that motherfucker drag like RuPaul, I'll drag your ass to the floor
Bitch, I can admit, I'm a recovered addict, paraphernalia that is
Telling the doctor I'm sick, head doctor, I'm needing your lips, yeah
Proper analogy for it, if I can afford it, then I won't ignore it, clear
Cop me a palace and Porsche and right, when I floor it, that's when I switch gears
Living my life on Uranus, ugh, keeping one foot in your anus, ugh
The other foot all on your neck, repeatedly stomp 'til I break it, ugh

I work with dope boys, I keep a fork on me (skrt)
I'm in my drop top
But won't let you get the drop on me (catch up)
I keep the yop on me and trouble seems to follow me
I take my pistol to the mall, my pistol shop with me
That bitch is jockin' me, and young niggas admire me
Yeah, but I'm a product of the streets so they won't hire me

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Can't let you play me off the streets you know I got kids
And more major keys than a locksmith
I could teach you niggas how to rock this
My bed was a pallet on the carpet
My ride was a bus named MARTA
Pillow full of Estee Lauder
Nigga, I'm allergic to a Charger
Nothing but foreign cars in my garage, ah
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, you ain't go to church though
I still bless you, but you know what come first though
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for

[Verse 4: Big Sean]
I'm takin' risks, she takin' pills, takin' pics
Day job night job, Jamaican shit
I stick to the basics, not a basic bitch
You deserve a young young legendary
Heartthrob speeding up your respiratory
Treat these others hoes secondary
I couldn't even cheat with my secretary
Faithful to you even when I'm on road
Even if I'm on a different coast
I'mma still make you feel close, mama
I'm addicted to your ass and titties
When you dance the bedroom turn to Magic City
Got my ass throwing hundreds, fifties
Outta thin air, yeah thats magic tricking
I take you to the Caribbean
Make your mind as clear as the water you swimming in
In and out that bitch like we amphibians
I won't change you up next season
For another chick like they did Aunt Vivian
I'mma put you on the businesses
I'mma divy up the dividends
I'mma show you what the fuck commitment is, baby
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give
Girl you make me wanna leave the one I'm with
Start a new relationship with you, this feel like déjà vu
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Sunday, that's what they pray to church for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for
Make me give up everything I worked for
You gon' make me give up everything I worked for (work, work)

[Outro: Big Sean]

No substitute for me, but they gon' still tempt me, nigga

Cause all I do is win, win, win
And if you going in put your hands in the air make em stay there

Who hotter than me (Khaled), I'm wearin' the crown
We can't stop, won't stop; go hate on me now

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could never get enough when it come to gettin' fetti
Niggas ain't ready for my Ferrari Scaglietti
Mario Andretti, money comin' fast
My honeycomb hideout is made of all glass
I could never be a racist
Wake up every morning just to count white faces, Neo in the Matrix
Glorious as Morpheus, employed all warriors
I'm mean as a scorpion, Dr. Kevorkian
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Fire and brimstone, yo
Everytime I come you gotta know a nigga comin'
Get a lot of money when I'm in the buildin'
And I come and say there ain't motherfucker money better, better, better, better!
Uh-huh, Okay
Niggas know I got you when I hit you with the pitter-patter
Whenever they see me then you hear a lot of chitter-chatter
Niggas know there ain't nobody better, better, better, better!
I watch a lot of niggas when I'm in the cut
So sick when I come and hit 'em in the gut
You will crown me king (no matter what!)

Ok, let's shine my friend
Get up on my grind again

Now I run the game so I toss the first pitch
Yea, I'll let you wife her but she still my first bitch
If it's less then nine digits nigga, that ain't fuckin' rich mother fucker

Ayo, all I do is win, ain't that the reason that you really mad
Undisputed hailing all the way from Trinidad
I ain't mad ma, see you on your bummy swag
I'm in that money green Jag, lot of money bags
I told Khaled you the best but I'm the bestest
Better run for cover if your name is on my checklist
You could talk slick, all the way down to the welfare
Ask the IRS bitch, I'm paying for your health care

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
I'ma make this here official, Let me clear some issues
First off I am not for Britney Spears initials
Thats no B-S, at your re-quest

Finish em, I'm through with em
They gon have to jump me, it's gon take a few of em

Ridin' through Harlem me and Jeezy pardon me
Puffy surfin' on the hood for niggas that keep doubtin' me

Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless like it's livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet
Lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga, play yo' part or parallel park yo' ego
Next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it
Or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac with a MAC
In the back of a 'Lac with a latch on the back
Of the trunk, hit a punk in the back with the pump
In the back 'til he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future
When you are mentioning talent
And I'm back in the back of the block
With a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch with a block
Or whatever and cut, no cut, mo' guns, mo' guts, fuck boy
You fucked up twice, you fucked considerin' you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip head first smilin'

Okay, big money on this side

Need a new safe, money getting too high
Dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up, she deep in a coma

My Rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do, Bird? My fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma

Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber

Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fishscales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail

I’m from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That’s why when the babies grow up, damn, they be like us

Man I’m so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain’t no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand (Young Money!)
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil’ nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I’m in a whole 'nother tax bracket
Amen

[Verse 1: Future]
A million dollar cash on me in the studio when I did this verse
My money is longer, my weed is stronger
All my bitches is badder, these niggas is sadder
My rubies got chalice so fuck all the chatter
Tissued the money, I rest on them plaques
King of the Patek, clarity showing without even knowing
Jump out that Lambo with the red bottoms on
The capital going up heavy in Florence
Duffel of Franks just to boost my endurance
Two number ones in a row
I sit back on that Act' and sit low in that Ghost
Lamborghini got a S, Sierra Leone baguettes, yeah
The gold from my neck, it done got in my flesh, yeah
Parking lot look like a film, yeah
My duffel stuffed with a M, yeah
My shooters at basketball gyms, yeah
I got some permanent scars
I will not wait for tomorrow

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, yo
Queen back in the US, low iron, but you pressed
Who lied and said you next? Crying emojis in my group texts
Stay in your bum-ass duplex, it's Minaj, no group sex
Queen never shuffle, you deal
Just turned down a four-million-dollar shoe deal
Keep your man off my Instagram, bitch
99 problems but ain't one a damn bitch
G4-fly even when I land, bitch
Lookin' like Pocahontas, yeah, they want my land, bitch
I'm just exotic, bitch, chronic bitch
Shoe game on psychotic, bitch
Yes, I am iconic, bitch
P-Pussy get 'em hooked like phonics, sis
Every ball player tryna find this bitch
Ball hard but I'm too fine to fine this bitch
I graduated with honors, bitch
I'm the truth like a motherfuckin' honest bitch
Full throttle switch
Pick a side, pick a side, they gotta switch
Big MAC billboard out in Times Square
And I ain't talkin 'bout McDonald's bitch

Welcome to my hood, them boys will put you down on your knees
(Woop, woop) That's the sound of the police
In my hood

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Audemar on my wrist, diamonds look like they glowing
50 stacks, all singles, I make it look like its snowing
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin'
Treat them like jack boys, catch them slipping then slay them
Lord, forgive me for my sins
That's my confessions, if they put me in this Benz
I got possession of a federal offense
I'm talking pressure in my criminal intent (Huh)
So wear ya vests and I'm still gon' stunt like it ain't no tomorrow
Fuck ya house note, nigga, blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back (Rozay)

I know some niggas from my hood that would rob Noriega
I’m talkin’ Noriega, nigga, the real Noriega
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, than stop impersonating us
And tell Congress when you see 'em, bitch, I'm stealin' cable
And leave the D-Boys alone cause they motivate us
And why is the half of my whole hood on papers?
Some are on house arrest, some are on child support
Some of them did they bid, the other half waiting to go to court
Mr. Landlord, we gon' bust your ass with an eviction note
Better have the police with you dog, if you came to repo
I'm talking strip clubs, I'm talking liquor stores
We throw our money round here, but y'all can

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Bitch, I’m on probation, so my nerves bad
And they say time flies, well mine’s first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit and practice what I preach
Back from hell, cell 23
Tell the warden kiss my ass, pockets on Monique
Bitch I’m from the murder capital, ho, I’m far from practical
Shit happens and since I’m the shit, I’m who it happens to
Young Money, Cash Money, blood bitch, I’m red hot
I don’t see nobody, see no body like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewn up, check the thread count

With this bottle full of 'gnac, I'ma sip this slow (Oh!)
Singles double when triple-beams take over
Now holler 'cause these Impalas got extreme makeovers (Woo!)
Couches covered in plastic, babies all in the street now
Wear the wrong color, catch a Rodney King beatdown
Kids hit with switches, mamas is quotin' scriptures
While Luda's getting head, more gums than baby pictures (Woo!)
Cock my .40 Glock and my partner just bought a replica
Now Asians sayin' they don't keep no cash in they register

Impossible for you to stop it (Damn!)
(More fire 'pon di place!) Now go and heed the villain
You're like, ""He's injured"" and prob'ly need a medical situation
Because the way I'm fuckin' everything up 'til the people dead

And, you don't wanna come behind me with it, bro! (Hunh!)

Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 4: Twista & Mavado]
Welcome to my hood
Where board members and faculty backin' me
If you ever try attackin' me
That could be when I eat 'em, especially when I beat 'em
When they see a bunch of killas and hustlas on the side of me
I'm an anomaly to 'em, put 'em on crutches
With succulent verses, I'm just the one that's kicking the ruckus
Munch as I smoke a Dutchess, and model bitches that cut us
And motherfuckers that love us, and enemies wanna touch us
I'ma spit a flow as if it was a sin (Haha, what!)
Then the gangstas are resting up forever (Ah...)
See a silent four-, put it on the fin (What!)
Then you know to never test him
It'll be a category F5 (Ayyy)
Handle military with automatic weapons, so let's ride (I...)
Love to the Hundreds, and everybody that runnin' them north
And the whole city, and I'm from the westside (Wan', today)

[Verse 5: Mavado]
Welcome to the gully where we no take bad up
Big spliff in ah mi hand (Haha) and Hennessy in ah mi cup
You see the gyaldem we have up is like some angels abduct
Them fat-tongue, grabba, yah hear me? Haha
When you pass the gate, written at the entrance
""Violate: Straight death sentence""
To live, you must be great; to be a snake, no repentance
We coming at you with vengeance

Never slippin', I'm ballin', Puff keep on callin'

Fuck that shit you be talkin'
Rep Miami, the ghettos (Dade County)
Every hood and the projects
And when I drop off my singles
I'm droppin' one of my targets (Tsssss)
Lord, forgive me for my sins (God, forgive me)
I gave you hits—I gave you ""All I Do Is Win"" (I won't stop)

Ace Hood in this bitch, ho
Kickin' down in your front door
Knock-knock, you hear the Glock cock
And that thing pop on that four-four (Brr-r-rat!)
Posted on it, that same block
I'm in the droptop with that bankroll
Young—Young nigga, I'm out here
Can't name a place that I can't go
Ridin' round with 'bout fifty grand
And they wonder, ""What do that safe hold?""
Middle finger them Feds
And that's what I pledge—a part of my G code
And it's fuck them prosecutors; hustler, connoisseur
It's We The Best Forever
Make sure you spread the rumor, bitch

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 9: Fat Joe]
Good coke, hard rock, stashed in the body shop
Only way to break them bricks down is karate chops
Niggas gettin' left right in front of the Marble precinct
Leave 'em like them Jordans, red-dot, leakin'
I'm fifteen when I first startin' coppin' pies
You 46 just turnin' Blood? Stop it, Five
It's like the only way to make it is supplyin' things
Hoop dreams, dunkin' over cars, let the choir sing

[Verse 10: Game]
Yo, it’s that black raw, black dawg
Pullin' up on that black Hog
Compton, that's my backyard
That's where I used to get them sacks off
But now I got platinum plaques in the back of the 'Bach
And I'm back with Dre again
Aftermath, We The Best, me and Khaled, Dre and Em
Detox, RED, that's back to the back
Step in the club with my hat to the back
Nigga, I'm so hood even though I'm living good
Niggas still in the VIP strapped with a gat
Drop a couple stacks, then, it's back to the trap
Couple hoes in the back, red wheels on the 'Lac
REDRUM if you try it; nigga, it's Westside!
Throw it up! Now!

[Break: T-Pain]

Savin' every dime (Yeah), tryna choke a quarter
And they ain't sellin' crack (Nah), they sellin' coke and water (Woo)
Smokin' or ya snortin' (Ahh), they coppin' all the Jordans (Yeah)
Nothing's more important, steal 'em if you can't afford 'em (Yup)
I'm gettin' to the money (Money), I need another comma
Some of 'em love the drama (Yeah)
More than they love they mama, ugh!

[Break: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hood!

[Verse 12: Bun B & Waka Flocka Flame]
Yeah! Welcome to the land of the trill
Well, everybody walkin' with they hand on they steel
And the model is a supply and demand, and at will
You been outta line with the wrong man and get killed
When you damned if you will, damned if you won't
Lot of dudes sayin' that they can, but they don't
And a lot of boys sayin' that they Gs, but they ain't
Mess around, get laid down in the paint
Better do what you say, say what you do
'Fore I come around your hood, broad day, with the crew
They got them FNs, ARs and Ks with 'em, too
And they will gladiate all day, what it do! (what it do)
R.I.P. to the trillest that did it
To my Gs on lockdown, acquitted
Stick with it, think I'ma stop reppin' PAT, forget it
RIVERDALE! Waka! Flocka! Waka! Flocka!

[Verse 13: Waka Flocka Flame]
Welcome to Clayton County (Ugh! Ugh!)
My house got surrounded (Ugh! Ugh! Flocka!)
Enemies tryna drown me
But my hood still around me (RIVERDALE!)
Rookie of the year (Yeah!), no Freshmen cover
Shawty 16 years old, with four baby mothers (Flocka!)
First rapper ever to jump off the stage on BET (Uh-huh)
And since Pac go to Hollywood to keep it street (Ugh!)
First Woo to put T. Rodgers on the TV (Flocka!)
Every day is a party on Grove Street

Makin' these bitches obsessed (woo)
Makin' these niggas grip TECs (ahh)
Flex on my ex (flex)

She saw the Patek and got undressed for sex ('Tek)
Dinosaur drank, I done found a T-Rex
Unleashin' the beast and I beat on my chest
Ah, uh, step on the peds (step on the peds)
Patek on my flesh (ice, ice)
Lambo wings, fly out the nest
We do not settle for less (who?)
I'm in the ghost with no head (ghost)
I'm thankin' the Lord 'cause I'm blessed (God!)
And some of my niggas, they dead (rest in peace)
Pockets on Gotti, we pull the street in big body
Might pop a wheelie, Kawasaki
We make the profit and cop it, as soon as they drop it
Money fallin' out of my pocket (hey!)

Yeah, yeah
The Patek Phillipe sit right on my wrist
With a super bad bitch eatin' right at Phillipe
Know she fuckin' with a winner
Jewelry lookin' like a slushie fresh up out the blender
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't
Even if I did, I don't remember
Been a player since the very beginning
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no
Chain flooded like the levee broke, huh, incredible
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope, shit, let the dice roll
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?
Drippin', let you know I gotta go
I catch you anywhere, you get strong-armed
I'm talkin' upstream on a paddle boat
Okay one car, two shoes
You in hot water like a pack of noodles
Yeah, wife-beater, no tattoos
Like Wu-Tang, my cash rules, yeah
Brand new Richard Mille and it's tourbillion (tourbillion)
'Bout to swap the Patek for the Vacheron (switch it!)

Ain't tryna flatter you but baby you a star
I had to come after you, I seen you from afar
When she walked in I was standin' by the bar
Soon I saw you girl my dick was standin' hard
She so wet I make that pussy fart
Pussy good, I just might buy you a new car
Girl you could come and meet my mom tomorrow
The way you walk I thought you was a model
I'm just a regular nigga from the bottom
I hope you ain't one of them hoes that like to gossip
First I eat it then I beat it just like Michael
Yeah, I rap but I don't consider myself an idol
Ain't wanna say it but I think I like you
Certain shit I just don’t do because I’m prideful
Let a nigga get a little close to you then inside you
It's okay bae don't be scared I ain't gon' bite you

[Chorus: Jeezy]
Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart
Yeah, I'm shinin', don't you see me from afar?
We the type of niggas pull up in new cars
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
She can't wait to fuck a nigga in your squad
Real niggas wet your head and they shinin' hard
Rolex today that Audemar tomorrow
Sometimes you gotta pick these hoes apart
[Verse 2: Jeezy]
One thing about that sack boy, I'ma run it up
Your favorite trapper's favorite trapper and you the runner up
Free credit, say one bitch, you know I got that sauce
Really got out here and got it I'm a motherfuckin' boss
Cause I call when I call I ain't tryna catch no feelin's
Dick rock hard, yeah I hit her with the buildin'
To all my haters I be mad too, you gotta watch this
Pull up in them 'Raris by the twos just like they chopsticks
It ain't about the sprint lil nigga, it's about the marathon
One time for my city bitch, they love me like I'm Farrakhan
Woke up on the first, yeah I bought a couple bricks
Got 'em all off then gotta suite up at the Ritz

Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shawty cause of you, went and dropped the roof
Went and got the loot
Went and hit the dealer, went and dropped the deuce
Tried to make her mine, I'm a hustler lookin' for a buster
Baby go and find 'em, see you on your Oprah grind
We can hustle, both can shine
She buy the payment I knew that
My mind's telling me don't do that, my dick hard so I flew that
That fake love, we grew that
Take off all that Mac and let me see the real
Twisted off that batch I can see your grill
Fuck the blogs, baby chill
I pick these hoes apart
Fuckin' with her mind
So much it started fuckin' with her heart
And I just play my part
I'm just seein' if you real, you wasn't with me from the start
These hoes'll tear your heart apart

Love 'em with your mind and never with your heart

I get a way for, and won't pay for and these bitches did't know
I told her take off all that MAC
Lemi see who you are
Even if you love ‘em they gon’ try to play you hard

Pick these hoes apart
Start off with their minds and then I end up with their hearts

I told her, ""Don't worry, we stay high""
Plus there's a bed on my tour bus

Straight up, look
DJ Khaled

[Verse: Big Sean]
When it get this dark, you gotta feel your way out
They tried to bury me alive, I Kill Bill-ed my way out
Letting go of grudges that I used to feel a way about
'Cause some emotions are too taxing to keep paying out
Life is what you make it, I know I'll make it for sure, then make it some more
I know critics hate it galore, it doesn't phase me no more
I know some peoples only taste of success is the bite that they take out of yours
My GG told me God laugh at you when you make plans
The type of wisdom that made us men
Plus tryna thank everybody who helped us along the way
Is like trying to name every single member of the Wu-Tang Clan
Yeah, I might skip one or two
But that doesn't mean they wasn't just as part of the plan
Some love goes without saying
Who would've thought that DJ that was on 6 to 10
Right there on 99 Jamz, screamin', ""We the best""
Would've had all the execs eatin' right out of his hands?
Showed us all the keys to success from doors being slammed
Look, I gotta thank Khaled, who back in 2010
Convinced Ye, Sean should drop ""My Last"" shit
It's a smash hit, add Chris to it and it's a classic
That's that rare shit, yeah loyalty everlasting, look
All I know, forever stuck to the code
Only one I changed was 48221 to 90210
Fast forward later, this nigga Khaled my neighbor
The type of stories that you can't make up
The universe doesn't just work it out, man, it works in our favor
What's Heaven on earth, getting everything that you prayed for?
Shit, believe it to achieve it or you never will
On the phone with Colin Kaepernick
He like, ""They not gon' make it easy for us in this game and they never will""
I'm like, ""That's not just the NFL, bro, that's every field""
Look, no restraints, bitch, only strength
That's my wavelength, surprised I ain't go insane
Heard more gunshots outside than the doorbell rang
And swam with sharks that's too big to fill up tanks
And I'm right here, right now, how could I not give thanks?
Feel my pain, I paint these pics, I spill this paint
I miss my dogs, I spill this drink
I pray that all your growing pains turn gold champagne
Plus I gotta thank my exes on some ""thank u, next"" shit
And all the old times that gave me new perspectives
Speaking of new, I'm about to ink a new deal, Don Life Records
And put anyone on in the city who needs connections
This that Fortune 500, my shit never plummet
I just bought a mansion and moved in the dungeon, don't none of y'all want it
So all y'all fuckboys that want us to fuck up
Just know I made five hundred plays and not one of 'em fumbled
My vision is tunnel, Sean Don
[Outro: Big Sean]
And I just gotta give thanks
'Cause it's that time
You know what I'm talking about, that grind time
You've been grinding your whole life
It's that time where that preparation meets that opportunity
And you gotta be ready
And give thanks5Embed"

With naps in my head, who's white or black? It's a rare package
Get smacked if you said that I'm neck and neck with them square rappers
My guest room's got plantinum plaques and a air mattress
No time for furniture shopping, too busy burnin' you
Watching you, learning you, word to Pac, I'm plottin' to murder you
Sure the thought didn't occur to you, my next album flop
Then I'm goin pop like Nelly with tops dropped on convertible
Porsches, born sinner, not burning no crosses
Might burn a couple bridges, I'm losing by double digits
I gotta do somethin', fightin' depression, I'm trying my nigga
But everytime I think about it, I'm cryin' my nigga
Cried myself to sleep on thousand dollar sheets
I reak of the scent of a vendetta that's deep
I'm playing for keeps, but you ain't think I'd bounce back
They love to hear a black nigga count stacks, count stacks

Forty thousand in my pocket, you see it
Another twenty on the way, you see it (Ay)

There's a Judas in every crew, concealing a kiss
Kiss of death, let's put the rest all to tedious bits
Fuck's sake, you niggas emanate effeminate traits
Bitch nigga, we could never relate
Nah, cause man, you niggas is birds
You learn that at bird school or somethin'?
You eaten that bird food or somethin?
You sick with that bird flu or somethin'?

And my stock steady risin', you would never get a share (No)
Ridin' nigga faces, I don't never get a chair (Ahh)
If I don't take a break off, you would never get a year (Never)
Prayin' on my downfall, you never get a prayer
Had to tighten up my circle, so I never fit a square
[Chorus: Cardi B]
I get big paper, so I deal with big haters (Yeah)
Got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors (None)
Got it out the club, they ain't do me no favors (No)
Cardi this, Cardi that, make me more famous (Woo)
Big paper, so I deal with big haters
Bi-big paper, so I deal with big haters

Go-go-got it out the mud, they ain't do me no favors

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh
Pat them down count the money, let 'em see the work, yeah
That's the definition of a major key alert
Another nigga gotta die, won't be the first, nah
Won't be the last, all we see is cash, yeah
Your real story don't match what you rappin' 'bout (liar)
So keep the movies in, stop actin' out
And I ain't talking 'bout no watch or no cars neither
Everything will get copped at Allah's leisure
Was a crack monster, I had the hard fever
Switch from the bald head to the dark Caesar
Used to be the capsules, now they love the plastics
I ain't tryna get caught up in this thug-rap shit (never)
Rather be bumper to bumper in drug traffic
Cash on deck whenever the plug ask kid
You don't sweat the small things, they become drastic
Next thing is cremation or a casket
Fuck fallin' back, I need all of that
I need my name in the cocaine almanac, Jada
Real dope boy put me in the hall of smack
Went to job interviews, they ain't call us back (hahaha)
Either way I ain't never evil
Why do you think the streets love me? I ain't never leave 'em (never)
Heart stops, but the words are forever breathing (forever)
You hatin' cause we the best, find a better reason
[Verse 2: Fabolous]
First thing first don't ever play yourself (ever)
Oh another thing, I ain't ever play myself (never)
Even when they all changed up, I stayed myself (it's me)
Did what worked for me, then bossed up and paid myself (woo)
See I’m showing the Piguet off, gave the Rollie a day off
Still got that work, I don't know about no layoffs (nah)
Team still ballin' so I guess we in the playoffs (swish)
Team full of baddies, all my bitches in a slayoff (ahh)
See we be in the party wasted, no part of fake shit (yeah)
Nothin' but love 'round me, Cartier bracelets (oh)
I feel like Frank White walkin' into Arty Clay shit (oh)
You niggas got fat while everybody starved
My city don't sleep, I ain't ever noddin' off
When you're in the Benz, it piss everybody off
So I ain't stall, I do me, I ain't y'all (nah)
This New York nigga let 'em hang, giant balls (ahh)
Odell Beckham, respect him, you can't check him (you can't)
Blindside hoes hit me when I don't expect 'em (hey bighead)
Then I hit 'em with the curve from the major league (hol' up)
Gotta wait your turn, that's a major key

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Mami yellin' I'm the greatest
Back to back with the slow cum
In the lane, I got her so strung, I don't even know her
Every night I meet a new wife
Now ask your wife what this dick like
Balmain Joe, every time you see, a nigga flee
Mr. Officer, I was only grabbin' ID
Mami only listen to Romeo
Wild cowboy, I be speakin' through the yayo
Bout to let the cans go, woah
Fuck your bitch and let your mans know, so
Yeah, now it's the Don in the Don, couple laughs in the Uber
Only drivin' Uber cause I'm franchised in Cuba
This is big money talk and you tied to the sideline
Brian Scalabrine, niggas always tryna high five
Gotta stay away from they driftin', all sauce
Every day Vera Wang, nigga, cloth talk
[Verse 4: Busta Rhymes]
(The Conglomerate)
Now I'm takin' over everything like that's my callin'
Wakin' up in pussy like beautiful Sunday mornin'
Now we swimmin' in the money like a line of dolphins (closed caskets, nigga)
Prepare for killin', now please line up all of the coffins (Closed caskets, nigga)
Think we playin'? Niggas think it's funny?
Pop you in your shit, brotha
Now make room for the money, MOVE!
If you don't make room, I'll beat a nigga past painful
Make a fool of yourself, I'll beat you past shameful
I get this bread and shine like an angel
One of the last with bars, you niggas better be grateful
(Thank you so much)
I Diddy bop and drop on you niggas
I count bread and take it to the top on you niggas (Mountaintop)
Blah blah blah blah, you sound alike, my niggas
Blah, blah, but when I do it, I finesse, I got it locked, my niggas
I give you new brand shit, fuck you gon' do?
And know we love the boom bap, oh yeah we do this too
Yeah, fuck with the realer side, oh you against us, nigga?
You better run and hide, until I'm finished, nigga
Don't play yourself
Play yourself and lay yourself dead in a casket
Pray yourself, end in a basket
Hate yourself
Cause you ain't ask if you could possess you a heater
Or you could be you a leader for the people
You talk a lot, I've seen the truth like Sevyn Streeter
Don't you ever play yourself
[Verse 5: Kent Jones]
I saw a lot of niggas fade out right after I put my tape out
I offered to help you shape up
I see that you'd rather flake out
Sellin' stories on them tracks
That nobody can seem to make out
That's why I keep a good head and shoulders
To keep all the flakes out
Seen a lot of singles chart on and off durin' the climb up
I bet if I had the clippers, they prolly all had a line up
You worried 'bout your followers, so hurt when I follow up
It's the ones with the most pride end up bein' the swallowers
Fuck a beat for a verse when I could do all three
No pop artist but pop is what you rappers do call me
A lot of washed out niggas tryna find hope in
I'm just tryna raise a son like my blinds' open
I know the hood well, but glad I ain't stuck in the streets
I'm pop chartin' but hood niggas got my song on repeat
I'm still loaded with illest ammo up under the seat
I'm playin' hopscotch with all the charts up under my feet
While you do it for the 'Gram, I do it for my Grammy
Fuck a gold trophy, I'm talkin' my mom's mammy (haha)
You gotta finish bigger than you start
Or fall victim to bench stories, you ain't even part of it all
Start from the bottom or oh, please, don't start at all
I build a ship just to survive my own flood, I feel like Noah
Cause all he had was little rocks, an ark, and saw
Road to riches, I'm still in gear while you park your car
Your baby wanna get nailed in the sprinter Lexus
Text back and told her
""Please be hammered so you can sex us""
My arm strong, if Louisiana then tell her Texas
And if it's not immediate then don't even send a message
FYI I'll be free 'round 2 or 3
And two things you gotta be, New Orleans
I'm an organ donor, I'm alive with no heart in me
So never say my name in vain
Cause bitch there's no arteries

Fucked up the trenches (Fucked up the trenches)
I weather the storm (Weather that shit)
Young living legend, I be on that shit that these niggas ain't on (Niggas ain't on)
I went to war with the system (Yeah)
To give my son toys on Christmas (Yeah)
Probably won't give me no Grammy (Give me that)
Putting awards on wrists (Yeah)
We had to kill just to make it out, shit, we puttin' rewards on niggas (Brrt)
Live by the gun and we die about it, shit, I'm praying the sword don't kill us
Praying the Lord forgive us, we going to war with killers
They put a bounty all on my dawgs, want 'em dead by morning, nigga
We took risks to live like this, ain't doing consignment (Doing consignment)
I brought my mama tears, and I turned 'em to VVS diamonds (VVS diamonds)
I know you see me on top of my game, ain't see me declining
Turned to a monster, the next time you saw me, you seen I was climbing (Seen I was climbing)
They took my elevator, I said fuck it, I'm taking the steps (Taking the steps)
Got me on bail, they want me in jail, they say I'm a threat (Say I'm a threat)
Fighting for freedom 11 years, they been taking my breath (Taking my breath)

Tapping my phone, taking my rights, and making 'em wrong
Deep in this shit, had to dance with the devil to make it back home, yeah
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
I got a call from one of the dawgs, say, ""You been riding private""
He say I should tell the pilot to come and get him
And the crazy part about it, my nigga sitting in a prison
And the other crazy part about it, I really know that feeling, yeah
I can't put my trust inside the system
Gotta be here for my sisters
And my niece believe in Christmas
And her dad, somebody killed him
Some shit I don't remember
'Cause I left him in a box when they had me in them locks
I blame God for my convictions
Never give a judge that ammunition
Never had no codefendants
God gon' be my only witness
Never take it personal, it's whatever when we handling business
We been through the worst, them situations we can never mention
You gon' have your mom losing her mind if you get a conviction
Got some homies sitting in the feds, hope they get an eviction
Praying to his gun, he got his fire, he ain't got no religion
I heard Meek got 2 for a wheelie and I was in the kitchen serving Had me thinking is it all worth it?
Thinking 'bout the chances that I took to buy you purses
Thinking 'bout them licks that we went on and just go splurge it
Switched it up and everything been working6Embed"

It's a blessing, you know that you're talented

What's sad is they don't know what balance is
I ain't been the same since I had a kid
Look out for him and protect where I live
I done got famous for what I did
Rollin' up papers and showin' love, we all in the same
Now the bank come to where I live
Don't hate on another man, no that ain't part of the game
Did it all for the fame
And don't call it a game
Started small every day

I'll hold you down (We the best music), I'm on my way
My mama told me (you are) make sure you got a rider beside you
Even if you ain't have all the money, fame and the power huh
So I found her, fly shit to jump up out her
I pick her low valley, she rock with me, it don't matter

Together we're better, you're a breath of fresh air
Hold this ready and I'm round
You hold me down, I'mma hold you down

I'mma get money, nigga, smell it on my gear
Black bottle, boy, baller hood billionaire (ah)
Boots in the mud, now it's marble floors (what)
Staircases to the roof look like it's heaven's door
Said a prayer for my woes who be dead and gone
How could I let you down if you never hit the phone? (ah)
Then they gave him all his money, make you go insane
We fucked the game, she said she knew that I would never change
Trap star, two bricks in the match box
Gold D's, fat boy, peanut butter top (wah)
I wanna spend a night with Jessica White (right)
But is a dopeboy really Jessica type?

It's been a long time and she's still holding me down

Nevermind the hoes I've been fucking with that's out of town (let's ride)
I have been through hell, had ups and downs

DJ Khaled! We the best
Who? We, nigga! We the best
This the remix! The ""I'm So Hood"" remix!
I'm makin' mo—vies!
I'm so hood, remix!

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Young Jeezy]
(I'm so hood!) Yeah, I wear my pants below my waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
We always gon' be the best, man
'Cause you and your man is plannin' to hate (We run this, man)
(I'm so hood!) And I got these golds up in my mouth
I make hit records, man, this is what I do
If you get closer to my house, then you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
I'm out the (Hood!) And if you feel me, put your hands up
I'm out the, this the remix
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
I gave you We Takin' Over (Yo Khaled)
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here you can walk it out
Ay, Young Jeezy (I got 'em, homie)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
You got me? (Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm (We run this, man, we run this!)
[Verse 1: Jeezy, Ludacris & T-Pain]
I'm so H to the double O-D
Walk around, there's goddamn money on me
Pockets so fat, don't make no sense
Whips so clean, it don't need no tints
Watch so bright, it don't need no light
You know where it were, don't need no mic
Niggas like, ""Young, what you get for your show?""
Tell 'em, ""Same thing I used to get for the blow""
Set 'em on the run, nigga, what I got to lose?
Put 'em in the vans, I ain't talkin' 'bout the shoes
Do the speed limit, watch out for the lights
Pussy ass niggas, gotta watch out for the dykes
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I said it
Seventeen-five, yeah nigga, I meant it
And when we do it bad, but I'm doin' good (In my hood, Luda!)
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so motherfuckin' (Hood!)

[Verse 2: Ludacris & T-Pain]
Look here, everybody come equipped with bangers
Throwin' up our middle fingers
And you know I don't slip
So I gotta keep ten in the clip and one in the chamber
Better be walkin' with angels
And never take candy from strangers
Through the stress and strife
Had to earn my stripes like I played with the Bengals (Hood!)
I'm in the zone, holmes, goin' for the two-point conversion
I'm so hood that Ludacris shoulda been on the original version
But this is the remix, with the cheap tricks, hittin' sweet licks
And I cut the braids off
But the waves and the fade'll make you seasick
See this is the way that we ball
And this is the way that we brawl
So put a fist in the air if you care
That united we stand and divided we fall
When the South's in the house, better watch your mouth
'Cause we on that hood shit
I'm hood rich, comin' around your hood, bitch
I swear I'm so—
[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Busta Rhymes]
I'm so hood! (Remix!) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
Khaled, they actin' like we ain't
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here you can walk it out
The kings of the streets and the gods of the hood
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Busta Bust, bitches!
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes & T-Pain]
See all I know is how to go and get my money again and again
Top down, let the money blow in the wind
With a bad bitch sittin' in the passenger seat
With a doobie-wrapped head full of bobbie pins
You know I keep that thang when I walk
See the dialect different from the slang in my talk
Baby still leavin', got a crackhead frontin'
Got another bad bitch that'll boost for the spark (Hood!)
I'm used to leavin' the strip last
Hustlin' until the sun comes up gettin' cash
So much bread in all of my four pockets
It look like a nigga got hips with an ass
And from the DNA in my blood
Niggas idolize me and try to do what I does
And if that other nigga ain't really from the hood
You can easily die, tell who that fake nigga was (Hood!)
And even though I spit a little rap
Got niggas in the hood tryna sell the most crack
Violator, I send a nigga to do it
Just to make you spend a lot of money just to get your shit back!
Y'all niggas know where I'm from
And I rep it to the fullest 'til the day that I'm done
So hood where we live, if a nigga sold drugs
And he rich, momma still proud of her son! (Hood!)
[Verse 4: Big Boi & T-Pain]
Daddy Fat Saxxx so hood like the Cadillac
Ornament, on from the Babylon
Call an ambulance to come and pick that ass up
Cause the nigga never had the chance
They tryna dance with the devil in a pale moonlight
Advance on a level that they can't do right
Lay hands on a fella like the man in blue lights
Whoop, whoop, do it twice (Hood!)
Your boy the B-I-G
I'm nicer than MC in your top three
You cocky, I cock, squeeze
Bust them things, now you sloppy
Speed it up, slow it down then screw it
Don't bite the flow cause I got that fluid
Run through the crew on some whole other new shit
Newness, bitch, we do this

[Chorus: T-Pain, DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
I'm so hood! (Remix) and if you feel me, put your hands up
(Hood!) My hood niggas, can you stand up?
(I'm so hood!) If you not from here, you can walk it out (Alright)
And you not hood if you don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout (Weezy!)
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm so hood!

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne, T-Pain & Fat Joe]
I'm so Hollygrove, New Orleans (Lil Weezyana)
Home sweet, Home Depot, you will need a hammer
It go down like Frasier, I ain't talkin' Kelsey Grammer
I be shittin' on you boys, I need a Alka-Seltzer sandwich, ugh (Hood!)
Since I heard Plies, I done bought the Phantom back
And went and got me a fifty-two inch Maybach (Calca, ghetto gatka, haha)
I'm eatin' like a big dog, I'm so full, I'm so good
I'm so straight, you so fake, I'm so real, I'm so hood (I'm so hood!)
Yup, crack, crack, crack, crack-crack-crack-crack-crack-crack

[Verse 6: Fat Joe, T-Pain & Birdman]
Yeah nigga, welcome to the Crackhouse
I should own a McDonald's the way I bring the MAC's out
I'm from the hood where every nigga lies
Flip a couple grams, they tell you they bakin' pies, shit (Hood!)
Still got my name carved in that central bookin'
Gave that pussy a scar and told her, ""Good lookin'"" (Yeah)
You's a crack baby, that means your momma paid me
You can't even blame me, that's what the hood made me

[Verse 7: Birdman & T-Pain]
Martin Luther King, Calliope, Magnolia, Melpomene
Gettin' that money with a triple beam
We ride on Clyde, on Josephine
Saints is my team, that's what we breathe nigga
That's how we eat, get this money on the streets nigga (Hood!)
VL my street, blood, five star G, blood
Fly as a bird, got these eagles on my seat, blood
Then head back where I stay, 3rd Ward, we get that cake
Thirteen is where I lay, shouts out to M-I-A (Hood!)

[Verse 8: Rick Ross & T-Pain]
Mo' money, mo' problems, don't call me conceited
Just call me the boss, always got what you needed
M-I-Yayo so hot, but my neck got the fever
If you sneeze, you get shot, Gunplay makin' believers (Hood!)
I just bought me a ranch, watch the hundreds stacks
No, those ain't Rolex diamonds, what you done to that?
You fools fugazi, my fools from Haiti
I moves 'em daily – it's a movie, baby! (Hood!)5Embed"

I'm addicted to winning and I can't be benched
Go to war for every black queen that they lynched
And my pockets on chubby but they can't be pinched
Uhh, after they use you, then they abuse you
Then they get mad when they lose you (excuse you)
You know the liar will accuse you
You know the queen still reign, it's just business as usual
Anything I touch, I bless it, track record so impressive
Opened the Billboard Awards with a hit record
The devil thought he had me
But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a baddie

Eating with Kent and Ace at a table, no dinner plates

Yeah
We the Best Music!
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Please, Khaled, don't pair me or compare me
Unless the said party is a rare breed
The stories I hear, they tend to mirror me
At this point now, rap is only therapy
President Push—I'm more Eric B. 
I ain't no joke—check out my melody
Felony, felony, felony, that's all they selling me
But two million in large bills is billing me
I was on the wrong side of the law
Like Pac was on the wrong side of the car
Like B.I.G. at the Soul Train Awards
The moral is all greats been driven
G-Wagons are bulletproof
The ones before me got snatched like bullet tooth
Tony nigga, only one left from the drug era
The jewelry weighs more in the drug mirror

[Interlude: Pusha T]
Yeah, what you see when you look in the mirror, nigga? Haha
Yeah, I know who the fuck I am
[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yuugh, tell me how you fit in
Was you a street nigga when Nas said It's Written
When Reasonable Doubt dropped, how was you living?
I was leading up the grinding in my kitchen
Getting work from Detroit like a piston
We was on a mission, stuff it in a Michelin
I could spend a year reminiscing
The length of your career, reminiscing
We can't occupy the same space
We ain't even running the same race
When it come to these bitches, it ain't the same chase
Moynat vs Céline, we ain't the same taste
Therefore, it's no comparison
To be mentioned with you niggas is embarrassing
I am one Joe Blow, you know my narrative
Clear your sinus like Claritin
Push

[Interlude: Jadakiss]
When you look in the mirror, what do you see, nigga?
'Cause I know when I look in the mirror, I know what I see
You peasants don't deserve my presence

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
You portraying other individuals
Me, I'm just weighing my residuals
From where success is the bare minimal
You a rapper, I'm a criminal
I had money before they found y'all
That's why I feel funny around y'all
Lord, bless those praying for my downfall
If I get too deep, don't let me drown, y'all
Hearing 'em talking 'bout how to flip a key
Started moving that Daddy Kane and Nicky D
Had the whole YPD sick of me
Don't sit, if you get tired, just pick a knee
Bet it all or bet it large
Now the coke, all these pills, and the crack, all these credit cards
I just laughed and I shrug at it
'Cause the niggas with the money are the drug addicts

Down south nigga, talking Jam Pony
Rest in Peace to Uncle Al, he showed me my first Rollie
Bitches want to know me, haters want to show me
But I'm just so vicious, double M worth eighty tickets
Cop just pulled me over, caught up in this thing (Woo)
Take my case to trial, my juror Paula Deen
I know they hate a nigga but he's such a major nigga
Give Chelsea Clinton the .44 when C.I.A. was with us
305 the realest, Ricky Ross the richest (That's right)

We killing niggas, no repents, my momma got like three Jags
You talkin' 'bout you a baller, nigga we really gettin' that street cash
Say old money, new work, smell the 'caine on my new shirt
My OG said, ""Strap up and don't lay your head where you do dirt""
And my momma said, ""Do schoolwork"", I was making that tool work
And niggas wanted me dead with a whole all in my head
Man they hit Big in the passenger, hit Pac in the passenger
So I'm riding 'round with this Mac on me and a bunch of shooters in back of us
Roll up, you a dead man, headshots when we clap at ya
We sendin' niggas to the motherland, and I ain't talkin' 'bout Africa

Feel like it's me against the world, bury me a G
My middle finger to the world, I'm gon' forever be a G
Pussy nigga want a witness, stay armed, no biggie
When we get busy, no alarms, just semis
We pour out a little liquor, thug life, straight balling
We cradle to the grave, ride when my homie call
Give a damn if it mean life or death, what's beef?
When somebody gotta die, we gon' march to the street
They said Brenda had a baby but she left it in the alley
One shot that playa hater now we going back to Cali
Hypnotize niggas, I got a story to tell
My ambitions as a rider got me ready to die
And when we ride on, no more pain, we go hard as shit
Why you complaining? And you wonder why we call you bitch
It's an everyday struggle nigga, me and my bitch
It's unbelievable suicidal thoughts you would get
Said fuck me warning and the gun don't blast
Give me the loot, sorry nigga, give me one more chance
You know this shit don't stop, keep these suckers under pressure
Hollerin' only God can judge me shawty, I ain't mad at ya
Got my mind made up, you nigga ""can't see me""
A paid thug nigga, that's why shorty wanna be me
See a kid around around in your town kick in your door

But I can't get this shit out my heart that took my father from me
Shit, do you know the feeling of success?
When you young and you black but you stressed and you blessed
And you gotta wake up every single morning, do your best
And when you get your cake up niggas gon' try you on the 'net
I had to switch way up 'cause I can't die by my respect
I got kids I gotta feed, I got a momma that can't grieve
When it was slow and niggas left, I made my mind up, I can't leave
Plus homie doing life, shit, I got guys that got free
Juveniles don't get no life at seventeen, he was eighteen
They gave him life so we gotta pray and believe
And try to squeeze on every resource that we know that he need
We must achieve
And once we see him we gon' go and succeed

Over the bridge is muddy waters, 'til your dreams come true
But I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
From the balcony I see the fountain blue
Over the bridge is muddy waters, 'til your dreams come true
But I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)

[Verse 3: H.E.R.]
Who knew it would be worth all of the losses?
Hopped in the Bentley, ain't even worry what the cost is
I know you out there tryna sell your soul for profit
We gotta count all of the blessings 'cause it's God sent
Standing on the edge right now
I said I'm standing on the edge right now
And if the walls come down
If it all come down
If it come down

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
Staring at the fountain blue from the balcony
Running a mile or if I was tryna chase a dream
'Cause I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
Ain't got no hate in my blood or no jealousy
Know it's somebody, it's somebody out there just for me
And I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
I can have it all, I can have it (I can have it)
[Outro: H.E.R.]
I could feel it in the air (The air)Embed"

Never let me down
For the kings have decreed (bless thy soul)
Righteousness shall be
Show us thy love, oh
Have mercy upon thy soul
Never let me down, no man
Happened today like nothing
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Sizzla]
I wanna say thank you for the time and the love that you share
All the help and the effort just to get me there
When everyone turned their back you showed me how muched you care
You believed in me, never forget you I swear
I'll always be strong, my character defines me
I will never be that hateful and throw stones behind me
Temptation and ego can get you so wrong
A lot of people easily forget where they're comin' from

[Chorus: Sizzla]
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
[Verse 2: Sizzla]
Hours upon hours searching for a better way out
And the evil and ignorant people sending the choppers
Still just gotta look out
Jah is my guide, I know I'm here for a reason
Put my trust in the Most High
And my prayers are so consistent, ah
Who would've thought it would be like this today?
Nothing but prayers lift up your head
Lion in the jungle, I tell ya
He who have been blessed...

[Interlude: DJ Khaled & Sizzla]
Welcome to Grateful
Strength is strength, strength is strength
You realize and appreciate your blessings
Embrace your blessings from the heart
To express your gratitude by doing righteous deeds
Asahd, my son - I love you
Thank you God
I also want to thank all my enemies, for turning they backs on me
Thank you, I'm so...

[Chorus: Sizzla & DJ Khaled]
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul
With the riches of love forever
Happiness shine as a burning sun
It's a blooming blessing, hey
Let it flow, it's a pleasure
Hours upon hours, searching for a better way out
DJ Khaled!
I'm so grateful for all you've done to bless your soul

Courtside, SportsCenter, I can make you a believer (Swish)
Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it
Hundred kilos in the Bimmer, boy don’t make me get excited
Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger, huh
Real niggas, taking over televisions (Huh)
Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes
Hot boy, Young boy, still on fire

Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin, it could kill ‘em
And these suckas, I don’t feel ‘em

Half my dawgs dead, the rest of them is here
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon believe ya
Said I did it for my dawgs, did it for my dawgs
Everybody ridin’ till you sit ‘em in the morgue
Started with a Bonne now I’m sittin’ in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you looking at a boss
Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless
Hundred bottles send ‘em to the vip, ballin’
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding

Got price on my head, I'm in a drop top 'rari
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’ (Haan)
Play with my paper, run up in your offices

Ok I did it for them niggas who they lockin' in them jail cells
Go to court they under oath they never tattle tale
Tired of countin money bitch I went and bought a scale
Homie caught a case I put a quarter on the bail
Look my brothers keeper, sleeping with the reaper
Rims on the jeep sittin higher than Khalifa
Its that black boy sleeves tatted, dreadlocks, fuck cops
Ridin with the burner turn your shirt into a tank top
20 chains on you would think I'm in a headlock
Everything foreign like I grew up on a spain block

Yo, watch who you drinking with
Watch who you smoking with
1.7 in my safe when I open it (Cash)
If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it?
And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquanted with you
Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgs so I had to put the bails up (Yeah)
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut (Uh)
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeh the pills is flying but the smokers is something else
If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt (Ahh)
The dough got ‘em bringing in the broads (Come on)
Obvious the flow got ‘em screaming for the lord (Lord)
If there’s money on ya head, what you think is the reward?

I laughed my ass off on my way here nigga
Bentayga with the brain bust open
That new Mulsanne got the brain bust open
Play them racks like Jimi Hendrix on the guitar
Load my gun, cock it back and then I push start
I can't name how many times they tried to clone me
I can't name all the names that tried to clone me
This dirty money help me see the devil
Sidity thots, know they ain't forever
My trials and tribulations playing out on blogs
Spend three hundred thousand or better, that's on all the cars
The Maybach park itself, nigga
That Range Rover came with steps, nigga
Electric tables in the back, I'm eating filet mignon
He been 44'n all year, I put that Rollie on
Trapping good all year, put the Rollie on
They parading in the streets, you gotta keep a drum
Say a prayer for my young nigga, know he dumb
The murder rate going up nigga
I done ran this check up nigga
Get hit up from the neck up nigga, yeah
The Goyard looking like a graveyard
Murder money, I'm in love with murder money
Old friends of me turned into my enemy
My money and fame changes niggas into enemies
All my hard work and lonely nights no sympathy
Want to send a hit but too far in the industry
I feel your energy, I know you niggas envy me
They rep the gang that bangin' it out in penitentiary
I watch the shit come out your mouth and it's finicky
I'm tryna love you but I doubt I'll scream infinity
With these billions on my mind, it's hard to be cohesive
Gettin' that A-Rod money like I hit the needle
Keep a spanish mamacita like a Fanta liter
And I gave 'em all dope and they pissed off
Got my lil Haiti babies waiting so they can wack ya
I got my Memphis Ten niggas waiting to jack ya
I got some DC niggas waiting to kidnap ya (chyea, chyea, woo)
I got the clappers, finessers and the trappers (chyea)

Told my bitch I love you 'fore I knew you

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
I am absolutely, positively on my grizzy
Even though I'm sick and I'm tired, I gets busy
Started a 62, but it ended up a frisbee
And me, I like to stand at the stove until I'm dizzy
Ball so hard it's like I brought the game with me
Left my glove so white you thought I brought Jermaine with me
'Bout to paint a perfect picture like I brought the frame with me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
I give it all up before I let the fame get me
I got niggas tryin' to sue me, bitches tryin' to do me
Way these niggas actin', you'da thought they never knew me
But these niggas know me and half them niggas owe me
I'm fed up, it's why I'm actin' like the old me

Before you let your top back, get your bread up
Made history, but now we claimin' victory
Get ya out the White House, go back to your efficiencies
Suckers feel me and I know you haters hear me
(I'm fed up, I'm fed up)
Like the IRS, you wonder what I'm makin, yearly!
With them brown bags circulate, so I perpetrate
We shinin' than the bottom cause we're down to twerkulate
Lookin' at the parking lot; better get your mind right
I hope you fed up being broke because the times right

[Verse 3: Drake]
Uhh, me and Wayne was gettin' high on 'em
He leaned over and told me, ""Just don't retire on 'em
And when they give ya they shoulders, never cry on 'em
And when they love you to death, just never die on 'em""
And the question still remains
Have I counted all the money that I've managed to obtain?
Niggas dedicatin' overtime to damagin' my name
And somehow I'm still the hottest motherfucker in the game

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
(I’m happy to be back man!) I’m tired of these haters
That’s why I go hard like A.C. Slater
Weezy Baby here, y’all pre-natal
I just get the beat and murk it out like Fredo
Uhh, I’m sick of bein' criticized
That’s why I’m higher than the Star Trek Enterprise
I do it big, don’t get mad cause you minimized
I keep a red flag in case I get penalized
Uhh, it's Young Money like you didn’t know
Stop playin', I hit Drizzy with the give-and-go
It was all a dream, now we the dream team
Who trying to see us? You seein' things
Hustle like I still pay rent man
Got a chest full of heart, no Tin Man
Uhh, Kha-Kha-Khaled I’m fed up
Flow wake the dead up, Weezy
[Verse 5: Usher]
Yeah, hop out, I been in this, been breakin records since '94
So I ain't gotta brag about records that I’ve broke
Records that I hold and records that I’ve sold
And I’m fed up with these niggas relieving my lingo (yeah)
Don’t bite the hand of your provider
You sayin' I ain’t influenced you, you a liar

Maybach Music
Out in Vegas like Lamar, third floor Tropicana
Fascinated with the cars, smokin' dope in the Phantom
Teflon's on the rise, I despise propaganda
Camouflage Mac-11, I should set an example
Never baptized, as I walk through the fires
The pain and the flame never match my desires
Crucified cause I'm rich, in the coupe, take a pic
On the phone at the light, Kelly Rowland's a friend
Catfish in the Benz, Manti Teo's a sucker
Plaques on the wall, hustler so I can say ""fuck 'em""
Bel Air for the hoes, Ciroc in the pool
My bitch is a stripper, her name is April's A Fool

She threw the pussy and I caught it, presidential 'bout 40
That drop head from Europe, that coupe got deported
I turn coke boy to that corporate money
Big choppa, I'm walkin' funny
Money talk but you ain't talkin' money
You ain't even got no corporate money

We the best, Khaled tried to told ya
TRUUUU! You just second best, Kelly Rowland
(Hahaha, I'm just playin' babe)
Uh, renegade like Em and Jay

If it was a slumber party, I'd be fresh in pajamas
Silence the shawty, I'm killin' them softly
They slept on me, I stopped sellin' work and started sellin' them coffee

Have 'em walkin' out with that choppa
These North niggas don't play that
They murk somethin', I'll tell you that
200 change for this Mulsanne and the wheel's a fortune, Pat Sajak
We catch cases, don't say jack
Don't talk work cause they tape that
Don't sell the work where we lay at
And don't spend the bread you can't make back, no
[Verse 5: Ace Hood]
Rest in peace
I'ma start murderin' and bodyin' beats
Ain't no defeatin' the eye of the beast
And I'm laughin' at people who try to compete
Name any rapper that's fuckin' with me
I'm who these niggas pretendin' to be
Claimin' you wantin' these problems
Tell momma get flowers and plannin' your funeral speech
My sanctuary's that cemetery
My choppa, named it ""Obituary""

Just wrap 'em up good so the dogs can't smell 'em

[Hook: Dre]
Brown Paper Bag (thank God for that)
Brown Paper Bag

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Thank God for those days, thank God for those nights
Though it might seem wrong, thank God for that white
They used to call me the Pyrex kid
A.K.A. Young Arm & Hammer
In the kitchen with the pots, yeah I work the glass
Hard on 'em, pimp, yeah I work 'em tass
And when they came in, we unpacked 'em all
Broke 'em all down and unwrapped 'em all
Just two words nigga, duffel bag
I just know it so well, can't help but brag
Gold Mouth got 10, Mel Man got 3
It's just your luck the rap game got me, hold up

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Here we go again
Just spent a hundred of that brown paper bag money all on Timbs
And the bad **** all on him
'Cause the cars that he drives are all foreign
The game is mine, I'm so far in
I'm speaking with an accent you just caught wind
Can't even relax in my room
That brown paper bag money push my mattress through the roof
This for my **** gettin' brown paper bag money
This for my strippers gettin' black plastic bag money
We talkin' 'bout that bad money
That IRS can't tax money, ya dig me?

Just made a hundred of that brown paper bag money
I thank God for the mil' he prepared for me
Take care my fam and my little dog, money

Just pulled over in my CM 5
Big bottle on the dash, hope he let me slide
Got 20 in the trunk, you can bet me five
20 minutes and they dump, I'mma let these fly
We the best! Look at what we drive
Got pic-nic tables on my lap, gettin' high
In the back of the Maybach, and it cost five
Hundred thou and a nigga spent that with a smile
Stackin' numbers at alarmin' rates
White house, still move a brick of raw in a day
I'm that Bin Laden boy, I'll bomb ya state
I ain't come to stay, I got a postbar and a date
Two million in a bag, ain't one to brag
You don't know the feelin' when the villain peelin' in a Jag
Just starin' at the ceilin', ten woman at your pad
I was at the center, now I see villain just in fact, I'm a Boss

Just spent a hundred of that brown paper bag money
It feels good to be Young Money, Cash Money

Practice make perfect, I'm relaxing at rehearsal
I'm a mothafuckin' professional, like Herschel
Walker, the talk of the game, is I
But I wonder will they still be talkin' after I die
But that's not important, money's more important
And understand I been in that water like I was snorklin'
Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin
Miami, Khaled took me in like an orphan
Why did they start him, now they can't park him
I go into the booth and just change like Clark Kent
Lamborghini dark tint, philly blunt cigar scent
I'm by myself cause niggas run they mouths like auctions
T-Street's my brother, FeFe's my brother
And we stay on point like a fucking box cutter
Ya heard what I say, mothafucka did I stutter
With my brown paper bag here to represent the hustle, I'm out

Coka baby, man you know I already had money

Ya'll niggas want coca music
Lacostra Nostra flow, show ya how to do this
Pin it so easy, a caveman could do it
Nigga, we simply the best, don't confuse it
I confuse it, critics be hating
Best album yet, don't give me the same rating
I'm waiting top of Rap Rushmore
Etched in stone, right beside Pun's noy
Unsure, anythings possible
4 mill spent, bought out the Art Basel
I'm Picasso, in a Versace suit
Don't worry my nigga, Khaled I got you
Not just cause I want to, cause I got to
Put the squad on your back, the impossible
It's only logical to spit it from the heart
Brown paper bag, who else but Joe the God?

I'm up out M-a-r-c-y P-r-o-j-e-c-t
Ain't no other motherfucker in the rap game harder than me
I go hard and get it in like a porn star
Follow my moves you wanna make it to the top
I'm OnStar for new born stars
Even when the camera stop
I'ma hundred million dollar movie, hand on my cock
Big Homie from the back block
When you first learned how to slap box
Then you even learned how to dribble the pill
Or to hand the pot, bring it back, rock
Number one rule: if your ass get popped
Don't chatterbox to the Matlocks
Death before dishonor, I'ma honor the code they created
Number 2 Rule and it might sound rude, but...
Yup! Fuck you, pay me!
I drown my pain in Porsches, I lost my partner to the bullshit
Still tryna hold on to my religion so
I put a couple diamonds in the crosses
Close your eyes, see the darkness
That's what it's like where I'm from
No lawyers no doctors
So either I go the hardest or I could just call this a night
On dark nights, it's like I see better
On Dark Knights I'm like Heath Ledger
Even if I overdose on drugs, motherfuckers can't kill my buzz
Wait, I ain't done; I'ma freestyle this, Khaled let it run
What's the hardest county in the Yayo?
'Cause I'ma go harder then they go
I'ma go harder than Baltimore
Philly gon' say they can't touch the boy
Where you at Duval? I'ma go harder than you all
Harder than New York, turn the Pro Tools in the booth off
I'ma go harder than Ye go
And Ye go hard; that's baby bro
Put some more beat on that joint
[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you were as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live you gots to go on
I am gettin it in until the end I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm gunna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon head spit that murder I wrote
Man I dont care what what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Dope like I'm comin to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin on me
Funny how I'm flyer then them all
Now I'm at the top ain't know where to go now
Instead of me, she gon go down
Maybe I would've slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin old but its good I'm young
But my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be numba one
I guess its gon be what its gon be
But heres one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas I'm out of here
[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me

Yea, yellin’ fuck a 9 to 5 boi

‘Cause I do it, do it ,do it
Like it’s no other option
Fat asses, big bottles
When I’m around they both get poppin’
I talk about girls and money
Too much I admit,way too much girls
Too much money,those 2 things that don’t exist
And I think It's so impressive I’m riding in the back
Young and black ’cause I’m chauffeured and not ’cause I’m arrested
Getting richer every year, yeah congrats to my progression

Ain’t gotta go back to my hood ’cause they 'round
And the niggas that’s next to me it’s all the niggas that stress with me
I done made it from the bottom and they say I did it on my own
So to me that’s destiny
If anybody got a problem I just tell ‘em to get on their grind
Try to to see as much checks as me
And my wife is a goddess my tree is the finest
A click full of real niggas that's just the one thing about us
They showin’ us love, but I remember back then the niggas would doubt us
We used to go out but now when we go out all the people surround us
They screaming my name, I’m repping my city it’s me who they proud of
So fuck what the lames about wouldn't me no game without us no game without us

I'm setting my intentions, manifesting good change
And life gets hard, but a purpose
Has gotta make the bad days worth the tears
So I'll just be still, be still

I am the streets, the future
I introduce you to Ace Hood, Meek Millz, Big Sean
Wale, Vado, this the future
They getting money, they making hit records
They hustling

[Verse 1: Ace Hood & DJ Khaled]
Okay now Khaled told me kill em (Kill em), he just told me kill em (Kill em)
Hundred for the Beamer, kudos for the dealer
Murder bet I wrote her, kudos to the killer
Chevy sitting crooked, teeth on Reggie Miller
I'm a motherfucking beast, see me in your sleep
Nightmare on any street, swear I will murk any beat
Spread this to the industry, lyrics like the chopper piece
Flow right through your fitted T, pull this loot with chemistry
Hottest nigga 'round, they saying greatness is my tendency
No such thing as sympathy, more money my remedy
Pockets on Heavy D, bitch I'm hot, third degree
Whip I drive, owned by me, wrists and neck, anti-freeze
Can it be I'm who you dying to be?
Last of a dying breed, talking Siamese
Twin pistol shooter nigga like a 7B
Big dog getting it, you still on your pedigree
Yeah, fly nigga with some stupid swag
Dead faces keep my money in a body bag
And I'm G-U-T-T-A, hops in the whip and I gotta get paid
Fuck them bitches, ain't tryna get laid
Walk in my house you can meet my maid
Any given day you can push that Lac
Push that Benz on, push that 'Lade
Hopped in the whip, no top on mine
Niggas gonna hate, man fuck them guys
Real nigga shit, don't tell no lie
Private plane, my seat recline
Top ten charts where I reside
Got me a house, about to sign, nigga
[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Meek Milly
We the motherfucking best, word to my mama
Ridin' presidential got me feeling like Obama
Cause all I want is change and my niggas they wanted the same
I wanted the money and never the fame
I turned into something they never became
Through all that rain, I kept my flame
And I kept burning and it's my turn and
Real nigga, my hood confirm it, now it's 6-2's on closed curtains
And that Maybach, let me take 'em way back, when I was starving
Now it's payback, nigga where that cake at? Murder all your artists
And I, I, I, I can feel that love, I can feel that hate
When I got that drum, I just feel so safe
I put it to your mug and it ain’t gonna wait
From this lil '08 when that thing gon fly
Got a little kick but it ain't no tired
Niggas talk murder but they ain't gon ride
Now we going hard like I ain't gonna die
Meek Mill

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Boi, boi, do it, okay, okay, smoke until I ain't got no lungs
Got her going down, no teeth, I call it speaking tongues
(Do it, do it) Now you speaking my language
From when they twist and talk with they fingers
Man but this ain't no sign language
Just fresh out of the ashes, this a Detroit fucking classic
From when MM got the masses, and Trick Trick got them passes
Bitch I'm from the Motor, Motor, yeah, that motor be the fastest
Bitch, they call it Motor City cause you're most likely to crash
Fuck it, good thing I got a chauffeur (Chaffeur)
Going broke? (Going broke?) No sir (No sir)
Bitch I'm the rap game stylist (Boi)
Cause I gave the rap game style, bitch
But I overshine, ain't no niggas over Sean
Toll rollin' five quarters so I guess we going overtime
'Til we dumb high (Dumb high) dumb high (Dumb high)
Westside, bitch I run mine
I'm rolling around in my old school, I feel like the alumni
Fuckin' hoes, no strings attached
So don't ask me why they strung out
I'm like Jordan to you niggas, I might even stick my tongue out
She wiggled and wobble, bobbled then landed on my throttle
Bitch, I might make you my baby and even buy you a bottle
Your niggas don’t ask how the top feel
When you keep 'em right beside you
My pockets got paper on paper, this shit just look like a novel
Boi, hundred thousand worth of ice on me now
But it don't feel half as good as grandma saying she proud
[Verse 4: Wale]
Forever dedicated, Maybach poetic genius
Some think they close to seein' me, tell 'em they close to Stevie
You poser niggas ain't 'posed to be here, we don't believe ya
Double MG up, we put a wreath on niggas' career
We the best, Khaled, no need to stress, Khaled
Know there's a lot of artists, but I got the best palette
Multiple colors, my mind is more productive than others
Married to Winnie, he think he really Nelson Mandela
That's fire though, one time for the 305 though
That hydro make me tired, yo, my kick game be so Tae-Bo
My balance be so tight rope, that's hard to find, Quick Tri-Flow
Can't fuck with me, that dyke flow, hoes blow for me, I maestro
Shit, that white whip sit like a slight wrist slit
Suicide shit, you can by shit if you write this shit
Nigga and right this minute, they say I'm buzzing hard
My driver's out of this world, you playing bumper cars
You niggas under cars, you should be unemployed
All you smokers Reggie, I'm in the telly, bunch of noise
Who gon' tell me that I ain't going or I ain't flowing?
Young Folarin, you see them 'puters, that was my influence

[Verse 5: Vado]
The Towers fell (Uh-huh), turned to Ground Zero
Kids ain't like Reggie Jackson, Nicki Barnes their hero
As I play Rothstein, Corleone like Bob De Niro
Been through it, we're here though, don't move with the weirdos (Woo)
Dress pimp, make a toast like, ""Let's win""
Penthouse is on West and Fourth, pipes and MAC-6
While we in a Maserati brickin' his best friends
When I die, tell 'em to turn my coffin to stretch Benz (Just like this)
Rims on it, problems, my mans on it (I see em')
See him, we stomp him out, his mouth, our Timbs on it (Yes)
Always smoking an ounce amount, no tens on it (No)
Spins on it, you have no clout depends on it (What)
What the fiends say, few roaches you need spray
On tours, we straight, making sure lawyer fees paid (I got em')
Get the bills due, Mildew SRT-8

My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write em'
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter
My darkest secrets are bright I need a sun visor
I say ""187"", make your bitch run my errands
I'm at the bar with a Dracula ordering bloody Mary's
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazing
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell
Got the world in my hands it got all under my nails
In a room full of stairs (stares), give em something to see
I be so fucking faded, Who washed the colors with bleach?
Now they biting my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street
The World's under my feet, I'm just kissing the sky
Tune, what is that smell? That's the shit on my mind, hah

[Chorus: DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes
Fuck all you hoes
1 million, 2 million, 3, 4
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, breaking up the kush, sticky fingers-onics
I'm throwing up gang signs you can see I'm in my vomit
And I'm cool right na' but please dont change the climate
Cause I'm sleeping with the enemy in bulletproof pajamas
I got issues bigger than you, bitches taller than me
Ratchet and Bougie, I like R'n'B
Unapologetic I'm sorry for not being sorry
You niggas old news prehistoric
I need benadryl for my trigger finga, bad bitches for my home boys
The grass is greener on the other side, I'm focused on my own yard
Ain't got enough, need more dough, we twisting blunts like torsos
I'm rich as fuck but more so, a poor soul
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier, GI Joe-Ann
— take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll em
I left that crab table with a chip on my shoulder, huh?

[Chorus: DJ Khaled & Lil Wayne]
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches (Fuck all of them)
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you bitches
Fuck all you hoes
Fuck all you hoes
1 million, 2 million, 3, 4
[Outro: Lil Wayne]
We ain't got no motive, we just killin' yall for nothing
And my bitch got cotton mouth, you know them snakes cannot be trusted
And I bet y'all niggas don't say shit, because I'm feeling lucky
And I still pray everynight that Aliens abduct me, Tunechi

Last time I seen bird, he said young nigga get this money
Fuck these niggas
And you know what I said
I said, fuck ‘em!
DJ Khaled

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Uh, murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Born sinner nigga, I was born winnin'
Heart cold, but my soul warm in it
Glock 40 and, I go to war with it
Steady aim, shoota' with a form, with it
And I go on tour with it
If I see it, then you know I'm gon get it
Yeah nigga, for the love of that paper
I got hoes sipping, liquor, six in the morning with it
I’d die for this cream, die for my dreams
As I stay and I fight on the side of the ring
With my back to the rope
Hear the crowd as they scream
But I come out on top like Mohamed Ali, woooo!
These hoes fuck so good
Now lil' nigga get money now
Same bitches laughing at me I was dead broke
Gettin' head from 'em thinkin' how funny now
Brand new Rolls Royce in the summer now
Big boy mink coats when they come around
And they wanna put a hole in my soul
Head shot for a hater now simmer down
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Yeah
Eight million dollars on a brand new Lamb
Suicide like revolvers don’t jam
Mountain top, nigga, high in this fame
Filthy rich, still doing my thing
Popped off, we had to pop that spot
Jewels flying, nigga, we so hot
Yachts, condos, living that life
I’ll do it again and I’ll pay that twice!

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Murcielago when the doors go up
And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up
But, when the money gone you know the hoes turn down
And I pray to God he don't let my soul burn up

And when the money fall you know the hoes turn up

Fuck this money nigga, fuck this chain
Fuck my watch, you can have that ring
Keep my whips, you can have that fame
So stressed out, I'm going insane
Young nigga can't even sleep at night

Fuck around and went and bought a chopper twice
Cause I'm paranoid, and I bury boy
If he playin' with mine, then it's oh lord (oh lord)
Please don't make a nigga do that (nah)
Please don't make a nigga do that
You don't know what the fuck I been through
Plus my lawyer texting me too

All these foreign's parked in my yard

Then woke up in a million dollar car
Boy I'm too stressed, so blessed
Please somebody pray for me (woo)

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
Still playing with them M's (M's), thinking like a felon (Felon)
Hope Shakir Stewart see me balling down from heaven
All I know is that these rap niggas dry snitching and telling
That work don't even come like that, fuck is you selling? (Huh?)
I gave you niggas a whole lane, a whole lane (Lane)
That's better than me fronting a nigga the whole thang (Thang)
And where I'm from, they know I'm the truth, just being honest (Yeah)
You niggas better pay all your taxes and plus some homage (Ayy)
I'm in a white chinchilla ('Chilla), eighteen wheeler (Let's go)
Five hundred in the back, nigga, ain't no body iller (Haha)
Do it for the streets and the slums from which I came (Came)
Got the same wounds, same scars, they feel my pain (Yeah)
Love this money making like Mitch, can't leave the game (Can't)
The only thing that get us excited, money and 'caine (Woo)
I don't know about the rest, just a legend in the flesh (Let's go)
And when it comes to here, I'm the motherfucking best
I could work four pots at a time, bitch, I'm a robot (Yeah)
The only thing keep crossing my mind, I hope the door lock (Damn)
Fuck niggas hatin', they fake, they can't relate (Nah)
Twenty seasons straight, no stain, let's call it fate (Haha)
Jackboys run in your shit, you give, they take (Yeah)
If you leave with your grind and your life, you're good, you're  great (Ayy)
Paint a picture so vivid, it should be in a museum ('Seum)
Probably why my new house looking like a colosseum (Damn)
I'm borderline brilliant, other half ignorant
That mean I kill a pussy nigga, get away with it (Brrt)
Last time I got an order, nigga, gotta slay with it, Snow

It's the biggest, haha (Maybach Music)
All black hoodie just like I'm Trayvon (Uh)

I'ma bond out my whoadies just like I pray for 'em (Pray for 'em)
I'ma take care of they lawyers until the case gone (M-M-M)
Half of these niggas singing like Trey Songz
Half of my kilos insured by State Farm
Niggas doing hits for free, don't even pay for 'em
Twisting up expensive weed, wait in LA for it (Woo)
Do it for dollars, not for the decimals (Uh)
You niggas headline the Fyre Festivals (Hah)
Your go-to jeweler is unethical (Hahaha)
