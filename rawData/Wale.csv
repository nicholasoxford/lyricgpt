Monogamy or whatever you call it
I'm startin' to think it ain't for er'ybody
Most of us is rushin' into it anyways
You know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't rushin' for love, and I ain't up here to judge
Let's neglect the what if's
And make it do what it does, let's get it

[Chorus: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
(Let's get it!)
[Verse 1: Wale]
Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun
And the hood girls want a smart nigga
College girls all want a thug
So it seems that we fiend what we don't need
Got a thing for a queen who know when to leave
I ain't 'bout to judge you, don't judge me
You ain't gotta really sing about your rap sheet
'Cause I heard you (bad, nooo)
In the literal sense I mean that
Rough sex, sayin' I love ya
But to kiss them is sayin' you mean that (bad, nooo)
I know, I just be callin' her mean-ass
Oh the irony, got the bomb indeed
But the problem is probably a deep past
Still I'm feelin' of somethin' I need bad
Thinkin' if I get her, I get her to need this
I don't need emotions to open your deep sea
I conceive an ocean by goin' between legs
Beg? Nope—bed, floor, dope; go for it, couch now
Slow motion around, put it down
Lord knows she was gone ‘fore the morn', hold up
[Chorus: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
(Yeah, let me tell you 'bout her, look!)
[Verse 2: Wale]
She hurt feelings, she break hearts
She stay quiet, she play smart
She take pride in goin' out
And gettin' hollered at and sayin' nah
She no saint, but she don't pose
She don't wear make-up by the boatload
Ridin' through lake shore with the nose up
She don't really date much, but it slows her up
She got haters, but we all do
Heard you're winter-time cold, shawty, fall through
Baby, look at they approach, how they court you
All those minds games, nevermind, 'cause they all lose
(Bad, nooo) In the physical sense I mean that
I ain't tryna kiss up, suck up, feed gas
I ain't like them nigga you suckin' your teeth at, nope
Play big, trust me I'll humble yo' mean-ass
Look, shawty is actually in prevent
'Cause the one in front of her is workin' with deep threat
Yep—bed, floor, couch, more
More, shower, Lord, perm, done
Love? Nah, called in the morn'
Cell number wasn't on, goddamn!
[Chorus: Tiara Thomas]
Is it bad that I never made love?
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I'll be your bad girl, I'll prove it to ya
I can't promise that I'll be good to ya
'Cause I had some issues
I won't commit, no, not havin' it
But at least I can admit
That I'll be bad, no, to you (to you)
Yeah, I'll be good in bed
But I'll be bad to you
Bad that I never made love
No, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck

Let me rap to you real quick
I wanna enjoy the luxury of like
Not knowing each other for real, hold up
Lotus flower bomb, firefly
When I'm low, she take me high
I can teach you all the sounds of love

[Verse 1: Wale]
Flower bomb, let me guess your favorite fragrance
And you got that bomb, huh, I'm tryna detonate you
No disrespecting baby, just tryna make you smile
Try to keep my spirits up, that's why I lays it down
Try to keep your spirits up, lil' vodka, whatever
Took you forever to get dressed, I acknowledge your effort
So I clap for her, she deserves an applause
Shawty working so hard, she deserve that Vuitton
Shawty, where your baton? Racing through my mind like
She heard that I got that work, I heard that she been on strike
Care to tell? I read your mind, she been on them dollars first
Caramel macchiatos when shawty get into work
I can be your boyfriend, be your nigga or a friend with perks
I'm just tryna work that, huh, they just tryna work your nerves
I'm just tryna read your mind, I'm just tryna feed you mine
I'm just tryna give you light, they just tryna leave you blind
[Chorus: Miguel]
We're living in a fantasy
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity?
Tell me, would you care to be
My lady, my baby?

[Verse 2: Wale]
Flower bomb, can I blow up on your mind?
This is not no Sandra Bull', but you're Potion #9
Navigating through her eyes, destination to her thighs
And I hate to tell you too much 'cause I stay with too much pride
And we way too young to know love, maybe not, but we don't need no rush
Don't believe in love at first sight, but I believe in love at first, huh
Can I be with you just one night? I could wear you out inside
I could tell you like persistence, but I make you cum in tris
I just think we need one night, can't decide if I came right
Easy, baby, my thing tight, but that lotus flower just ain't right
I ain't thinking, I ain't right, can't decide, but I can't fight
Easy, baby, you the bomb and all but I be damned if I do not land mine
Or at least try, can I speak up? Was it peace out? Can we eat lunch?
Can we take shots? What's your flavor? Flat drinks we call A cups
I just think I need one night, slightly more if it's done right
With that gorgeous face, I don't know your name
It ain't important babe 'cause I'ma call you mine
[Chorus: Miguel & Wale]
We're living in a fantasy (Haha, Ralph)
I feel it when you dance with me
It's feeling like you need to be
My lady, my baby, yeah
Can't you see
I'm talking about eternity?
Tell me, would you care to be
My lady, my baby?

[Outro: Miguel]
'Cause I don't know you, you don't know me
The clock keeps ticking, baby, what's it gon' be?
I don't know you, you don't know me
Let me teach you all the sounds of love
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, eh-eh-eh-eh-eh
Ee-ee-ee-ee-ee, I, O, U

Bad girls ain't no good, and the good girls ain't no fun

Yeah, cause real niggas just want (haaaaa)
So it seems that we caught up in the wrong thing

Seems like the ones who roam never got a ring
And I can see that you're (bad, no to you)

Gone blaze up, take the wheel Jah
And Rihanna got these women in they River's Island
I'm just tryin' to take a dip ya (splashhhh)
Never did terrible bullshit ya
Enough with concerns, she try and live it up
No more sucker for love, she probably duck it because
You try to follow your gut feeling you get lost
(Cause I've had some issues) Yeah and I noticed it
You got the coldest corazon, but warmer skin
You froze with it, you try and play Sub Zero I be Scorpion
Pshh get over here today
Smellin' like Jean Paul, got the ye
Got about three friends, she don't even tweet them

Seinfield: Getting engaged is like getting, uh, it's the first hill of the roller coaster
And you hear those clickers, the loud sound - this really violent, metal
'Chunka-chunka-chunka' and you go, ""What, what's going on here,"" You know?
""Boy this thing is really, really goes high!""
Wale: I'm looking down, 'Oh shit!'
Seinfield: And then you go over the top, the wedding is at the top. You go over the top, is the wedding and then you're just screaming
Wale: Even if you make plans you never think you're really ready for marriage?
Seinfield: No it's uh, it's like any growth. You're no- you can't be ready for it because tha- it's growth, it's gonna be new. It's gonna be new. You're gonna have a new life, you're gonna be a new person

[Intro: Usher]
Couldn't make you wait forever, for forever
This is forever
I gotchu

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it
Baby, don't worry, I've got plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 1: Wale]
(My sincerest apologies, I mean it)
Look, I'll admit it, albeit pathetic
That I'm in my late 20s, still never been to a wedding
Guess the idea of that lobby empty do not sit with me well
It’s not your fault they try get me cause I'ma need the sales
Cause I'm selfish, and I need you to myself
Tryna see you afloat, but don't wanna see you excel
Cause I failed and see you 'bout to cry
Cause when I enter they city they leave without they pride
I'm sorry, and you starin' at my comments
Fearin' it's gone always be you sharin' me with all them
Wrong, how dare I say ignore them?
Preparing for that day I leave you here and switch you for them
It's hard, you know temptation and all
Bitches out here tryna see if my relationship's strong
Get a place in the charts or runaway from your heart
Gave this music my all, nothing is sacred no more - I'm wrong
[Pre-Hook 1: Wale]
But I'm promisin' you better though
And your friends sayin', ""let him go""
And we ain't gettin' any younger
I can give up now, but I can promise you forever though

[Hook: Usher]
If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it

Baby, I've been making plans for you
Baby, I've been making plans
Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Realest shit I ever wrote, realest shit I ever wrote
Realest shit I ever wrote, if you ever knew love)
I’ll admit it, let me be hypothetic
The day I find a woman I prolly be scared to share it
The idea of me finding love, would run somebody off
And true my wall could use some plaques, but still I gotta floss
Brush you off, see I'm kinda lost
Now I'm up in the club with a couple of move ons
And dark, good nigga, troubled heart
Went from fallin' in love to drunk and fallin' apart
This is hard, tryna find some time to move on
Cause when we lost our baby, I got shady, shit got too dark
Soft, and I thank you baby, you strong
My ex before you married too, you solo, I say so long
Nah, good terms how that ended
But it surely put a dent on how I worry about this business
Off white picket fences, on flights with the children
On site stealin' kisses on off nights my intentions but
[Pre-Hook 2: Wale]
But I plan to do it better though
But you still sayin' let it go
We ain't gettin' any younger
Women love me now but in your eyes we forever though

If there's a question of my heart, you've got it
It don't belong to anyone but you
If there's a question of my love, you've got it

I've been making plans, oh love
Baby, I've been making plans for you

Baby, I've been making plans for you

[Outro: Wale]
We ain't nothin' but some planets

Seinfield: I always feel like I’m a planet. And these other women that are, kinda moving through this solar system with me. And, marriage is like you decide to jump off of your planet, across to another planet. And you can only do it when one planet passes real close. And you look and you go, “Hey, I think I can jump across.”245Embed"

The time is now, on everything
Took my heart away from money
I ain't interested in fame
And I pray that never change
Ambition is priceless
It’s something that’s in your veins
And I put that on my name

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, only hope I had was selling dope
Was on my grind cause times was harder than a cellar floor
My momma taught me never steal and never tell on folks
I grew up looking up to niggas that was selling coke
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
No religion I was getting saved by the Glock nine
By the minute I was getting paid like a hot line
Servin' raw and, fiends was calling, we was dot com
Well connected, well respected and well protected
Ain't get accepted, was rejected and now they regret it
Ain't get my message, was no signal when I was texting
The niggas I was calling was fraud and I learned my lesson
Now I move with aggression, use my mind as a weapon
Cause chances are never given they tooken like interceptions
So throw that pass, I’ll be the cornerback
Me and Folarin MMG gon' bring that Warner back
[Hook: Wale]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
It speaks for itself
Define ambition for me

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
My ambition to win, just to get me some ends
Help me pay my little rent, maybe sit in a Benz
I saw momma praying as she wait on results
It was hot in the kitchen can I wait on the porch
My father was missing, War Lord Oliver North
Life was diggin’ me deeper, I kept on coming up short
Breaking so many laws, waking up in the dark
Who cut my power off? it’s time to move that powder soft
Not too many options when you coming from the projects
Sittin’ in the trap now you moving Cyndi Lauper
Girls wanna have fun, and a nigga with some change
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is priceless that’s something that's in your veins
And I doubt that ever change
Ambition is my shit and I put that on my name
And I doubt that ever change
[Hook]
For my ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
They gon' love me for my Ambition
Easy to dream a dream, though it's harder to live it
Look, they gon' love me for my ambition
Beautiful music, painting pictures that be my vision

[Verse 3: Wale]
Well wishes to my opposition
You niggas probably cop a plea before you cop a pistol
I got nothing against them, they got fucking potential
But every nigga who can read gotta get his issue
Subscribe, niggas reside where all the lions and killers be
And I ain't spend a minute up in the streets
But I’m limitless mentally, I’m lyrically ZMT
Lebron shit, I was in that 6 after 23
And family is everything, and money is less important
Long as your mama love you, don’t ever love a woman
I got a lot of bitches, they got a lot of feelings
But I got that green on my eyes
And that ain’t no Donnie Simpson
I retire you niggas: fuck you and your position!
They placeholding so slippery niggas can’t even kick it
Y’all rambling, talking shit to these bitches
You know you real you don’t say it
You know you real, we gon feel it
Ralph!

Sitting in taxi cabs, where daddy roaming the streets
Seven hallelujahs, my sutana was clean
On everything I wear it, all the America's tees
This whole system most prolific in the DMV
Listen when you get the keys it's seldom, you don’t get the beef
Make a nigga wanna get the piece to get to peace
You gon' need more than Wikipedia to get to me
PG to Mo County bet they all know about me
Every hood, every 'burb, I got superb balance
From the city that made me love you forever for it
Hope you celebrate every moment forever ignore it
You made me what I am, you made me what I'm not

As you reaching your goals, you gon' meet you some foes
Having dinner with Leonsis I'm dreaming to own
But for now me and my homies see the bottom floor
I'm trying to redefine the culture, and renovate the soul
Women in town, but I'm manifestating every goal
I see potential in John, talk to him once a week
Media targets in our city it ain't ever sweet
I lost a lot of friends and they ain't even dead
When I was on my way up, why you ain't see the stairs?
Lord father if I opted to follow them
My heart would tear from my dreams let me know that you here
And it's rare when I'm anywhere with too many heads
Niggas jealous and never tell it until they stare
How could you blame us envy?
We do the same thing for a living
Know the same niggas, but they all commend me
Champagne I'ma spill it until we all fill up
Maybe it stopped me from giving a fuck about opinions
And probably not, but I'm temporarily out of fizzucks
So tell the post to leave propaganda to politicians

[Intro: Jerry Seinfeld (Elaine Benes)]
I guess maybe some little problems could arise
(There are always a few)
If anything happened and we couldn't be friends the way we are now, that would really be bad
(Devastating)
Because this is very good
(And that would be good)
That would be good too, the idea is to combine this and that

[Verse 1: Wale]
Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell everybody that we're just friends
But to be honest that platonic shit's for TV shows
Same place, we're with different folks
Case closed if they crack the code
Is it me, or is you cold?
Cause the feelings you ain't showin' pokin' out your clothes
Go put a sweater on or get a room
Forbidden fruit, swimmin' in your juice
Lot of ways I can get to you
But my train of thought is tryna get you out your ch-ch-choo

[Pre-Chorus: Wale]
Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Could somebody tell somebody
I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go
Work
[Chorus: SZA]
I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time, we can hook up
We can hang out, we can just chill

[Verse 2: Wale]
Tryna keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Tell 'em all that we're just cool
As far as me and you, we got a simple code
Spendin' nights, well that's optional
No telephones in the afternoon
I know that overthinkin' only leads to subtweetin'
Every time your ass in the mood
Sharin' thoughts when we share a room
Though we barely talk when we share a room
In the dark, still see your curves
Body like what, swear to God you're a miracle

[Pre-Chorus: Wale]
Still we keep it low
Keep 'em all on that need to know
Could somebody tell somebody
I'm somebody and I'm sorry but somebody gon' need to go
[Chorus: SZA]
I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know your name
And maybe some time, we can hook up
We can hang out, we can just chill
[Interlude: Jerry Seinfeld (Elaine Benes)]
I mean let's say, what if we did?
(What if?)
Is that like the end of the world or something?
(Certainly not!)
Why shouldn't we be able to do that once in a while if we want to?
(I know!)
I mean really, what is the big deal? We go in there, we're in there for a while and then we come back out here. It's not complicated
(It's almost stupid if we didn't!)
It's moronic
(Absurd!)
[Chorus: SZA]
I'm not tryna pressure you
Just can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
You ain't even really gotta be my boyfriend
I just wanna know your name

Baby, you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again
Baby, you got a body like a Benz
And I'm just trying to drive it once again

[Verse 1: Wale]
Shawty, can I fill your tank, yeah?
I start off with that, ""what you drinkin'?""
Pardon if I'm road raging
But I know you heard my drive is crazy
Yeah, let me pace that with some patience
Let me do it till I fill every void
You're like a Maybach, thinking damn
They ain't even make 'em like you no more
It's like a high beam gleaming through your eye (bling)
I adore you up, baby suicide
A little wordplay, I'm hoping I can make you smile
Least until I'm out of line like a DUI
Girl, you remind me of my Jeep
Can I see what's up with that G-Wagon?
Can I take you off of these streets?
To the side of me, I'm trying to see your hazards
Trying to be with the baddest, won't be the fastest
Gotta make it last, I hope you comfortable
I need to get to you, you're like a '62
A little work then it's curtains when I'm skrrting through
Came through in the group, trying to leave in the coupe
That mean I gots a few, but I believe in you
Trying to chase the cat, know I'm killing it, dawg
You ain't feeling me naw, that mean I don't need the roof
[Bridge: Jeremih & Wale]
You remind me of my Jeep, I wanna ride it
You something like my car
I got the keys to them, I need the keys to you

[Pre-hook: Jeremih]
You put on a show, you don't need no clothes
Give me little bit more, always take it slow
I know you don't wanna stop, I'm trying to make it go
Now speed it up like a Maserati, and look at me and pose

And I'm just trying to drive it once again

A good woman is scarce to us
And I wasn't prepared to love
I know it sound crazy, but your miles scare me
I'm just here cause your character good (truth be told)
A good nigga is rare to her (truth be told)
You heard it all, but hear this love
One night with dude, I be the reason you cool
So let me know am I clear enough, yeah, what's up?
Way I, way I, that's the way I think
Shawty straight like a concept on Bayonne Street
In the morning I slide over, she needs a ride I'm like
""Tight, let's keep it AMG""
Sliding down, precipitating is straight
Top down, let me kiss your physique
I'm digging your fleek, I'm checkin' your gear
Can tell you had a good year, spent a grip on your feet
She like when I drive it, I like it in park
Pull that thing over you likely to sore
I got her floating like riding on stars
So I keep it GPS, see where this going
Nothing will stop it, I slide in no prob
Ch-ch-chop it, my swipe your parts
Sex is her weapon, my snake in her garden
So know when I'm not here the viper is on

I thought it was important to go right into the booth after the arguing
I think it's only right, hoarse and everything
Like fuck it though, what's up

[Verse 1: Wale]
Pessimism is all that she know
Cause every brother she go with always pick up and go
I been trying to show you somethin, got a different approach
Told her, ""Give me your heart; try to get you the globe""
Have the world baby girl, live it up, you deserve it
Every time she catch feelings she go throw away the gloves
We go together / break up
We go together / break up
Ain't this an insecure bitch, meanin we love to make up
When we good, we good shawty
We don't ever make love
But if I call you out your name, I bet your ready to ""uh!""
You say you ready, you ain't ready enough
Cause when it fall right in your lap, you be ready to get up
This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit
She the shit, she the one
She got cold feet, my love will be the sun, get it done
This is her, this is it, this is sabotage love, counterfeit
She the shit, she the one

I'm feeling like I never want to be apart
But just when it gets good, she's gone
And I'm left right back at start..

Let's roll a J and pretend we in love
I've got a paper plane, it's propelling my buzz
I'm trying to make a way, she never call back
She's tryna fall back, cuz she say I'm all that
She only love me when I be ignoring
When I be doing throwin it on her, shorty brushing me off
I swear, I kinda feel like she's slightly bizarre
Sabotage all the time, have me Avatar'd
Blue ball, who fault? Mine, only cause I stick around
She leave before the sun up, leave you something to think about
Yea and this is something to think about
Why people want you single every time that you got a spouse
Ha, that make it hard to be faithful
Knowing I can go wherever and get 8 more
Ten more depending on where Wale going
Fuck it I got a few more now that my hair long
It’s weird shawty, your wares showing me dead wrong
You gon' miss a good thing, end up bitter alone
Shit ain’t better alone
I get her once I bet you keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for more
Keep coming back for more, keep coming back for...

I promise you ain't never really freak out until you be out at freak hours and see each and every freak out from free couch to free couch

We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light
We go deep and we don't get no sleep
Cause we be up all night until the early light

[Verse 1]
Man they really ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
I used to pop blues with my lil' chick
I call her boo cuz her real one I will forget
I use a Uber to scoop me to SLS
What you expect, a little groupie to see my crib?
Oh no, no these women ain't serious
Do you know what type of women I've been dealing with?
Try to tell me adderall make her get a rush
Used to use it to study until she fell in love
Told me that lil buzz just make her think a lot
Told her ""Nah you lying, cuz you don't eat enough""
Nah Nah Nah
These women ain't serious
She sprinkled a little something up in her liq
Start sipping and now she sweating, her lips clenched
Kind of dizzy, her friends tell her to get a grip
I'm trying to get me a real woman to take out
But for now, they're wild
They rather get it in

Cause we be up all night until the early light

[Verse 2]
In her purse where her hand go
She disperse by the handful
Coco make her go up
Nothing popping, pop a Xan' when she laying low
Bars to break, so many bars to break
She at the Grammy's turnt, none of the stars is fake
She like ""Oh my God, I'm on the moon and I'm lit""
And my particular moon like a platoon and shit
You know the hitters that I'm dealing with
Politicians and niggas living it on the rip
And my position to give my lyrics to little kids
Is not official unless I'm giving them authentic
We're all living with small demons
We're all sinning, it's all similar
Broads with us and they bong hitting
Let me tell you about the women I be chilling with
The really insecure ones look good in here
Nothing fill the void of a little pill
A little shot, she ain't shy when the liq spill
And it's hard to feel alive when you're feeling dead inside
Beside that the lime light be so real
Let me tell you about the women I be chilling with
Told me nobody love her, that's why she cut her wrist
Not enough for the hospital but cut it close
That's why she want to get high cuz she be feeling low
Told me pour me a vodka, pill and little smoke
So I could numb her insides and we will never know

Look, another day, another dollar
She hate me when I leave cause when I leave I never call her
That's life, shit, aight, shit, I could call you right quick
But if I call, you gon' be like, ""Boo, why we haven't skyped yet?""
And on Skype, bet you say, ""'Le, where my flight at?""
If I decline then you inquire on where I spend my nights at
Shit this life gets overwhelming and more then hectic
But a woman worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
Just look closer, my life is quite deceptive
Women'll sell they soul, just to buy some attention
I need something to hold, fuck that passive aggression
And when I'm back from off that road, don't ask me no questions
Please, fear what you don't know, haha

Don't remember how I met her, but I know I won't forget her
And If loving her is wrong then I just know I won't see Heaven
She say she from Seattle, she 20 and some change
Before I get to T.I.A, I'm sure to make her rain
Then I'm back up on my plane, Chi-town O'Hare
We spend some time and get some wine, have some milds from Harold's
I told her this here's overrated, but I love your city baby
Gotta get back to the D, you know we finally famous
Driver drop me off at Dulles, I'm headed to some money
TSA be laughing, all them rubbers in your luggage
I know I'ma always leave 'em, but I swear I'll always love 'em
Tell her you'll probably find someone but you'll never find another

Got on my suede shoes, I'm in a great mood
Air baggage claim, awaiting miss thang out of St. Louis
Know she shining bright, got on my Cartier
She my Billie Jean, we menage with Mary Jane
See we city hop, Vegas to LA
Brings a lot of joy, Bugatti boy, that's lane to lane
Our faucets used to drip, I used to ride the bench
But it was written in cursive for this king to exist
Packed her bags now she live amongst entrepreneurs

Accountable for a half a million uncounted for, boy

Sippin' syrup by the gallon, smokin' kush by the pound
Make it flood with the ones, broke bitch might drown
Juicy got chips like Frito-Lay
And I'm fucking these chicks out of D.O.A
I'm so dopeboy fresh that you think that I'm selling blow
Take your chick to VIP and get her pregnant in her throat
Shawty bust it open for me, I might throw this cash
Shawty throw that ass like a Hail Mary pass
I'm fucking me a new chick every night
Make that ass clap, I don't care about that cellulite, uh
[Hook: Wale]
Shawty got a big ole butt, oh yeeeeeeah

Clappers to the front, got a backwood full of skunk
Got a white boy with the funnel gentrifying, that's whats up!
Look, clappers to the front, all you niggas got the skumps
Now she finna bust it loose, screaming rest in peace to Chuck
It's that DMV, we up at KOD
And I can CC you these CC's
But don't be OC

[Verse 4: Nicki Minaj]
Shout out to that cellulite
Got a real bad bitch that will sell you white
Got another bad bitch that will sex you right
Got a couple hoodrats on Section 8
Make a nigga cum, don’t procrastinate
Ass on 5-0, come crack the case
Got ass for days, come activate
This ass on fire, evacuate
Throw that ass in the air, evaporate
Where your money? Let a bitch evaluate
If you 'bout big money, elaborate
I'ma shake this ass ‘till I graduate, nigga
[Hook: Wale]
Shawty got a big ole butt, oh yeeeeeeah

It's like, sunshine on a rainy day
It's like a high, could you take me away?
Take me away, away
It's a beautiful bliss, oh (When you feel like this)
Beautiful bliss, oh (When you spill out hits)
Beautiful bliss, oh, oh, oh (When you fly as a bitch)
And you ride with this, and you ain't bothered a bit now, baby

[Verse 1: Wale]
Fresh out the airport, fresh out the chair with the clippers
Like Shaun Living', thinking, hmm
I'm tryna get it like Sean get it
If Lord giveth, a mil' and a MILF light skinneded
It's slight blemishes and life system
But I'm giving it foundation when I write lyric
That Anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
And a nigga so fly I should be droved in jets
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath
No joke, you see them boys sign me to the scope, right?
[Chorus: Melonie Fiona & Wale]

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville could get a deal?
Ay, tell them niggas at the top we want yo spot we are for real
And yeah, we heard you got it locked but like them socks, we on your heels
So you best be on your toes nigga, especially on your flows nigga
Cause man they keep on checking for me, especially all your hoes nigga
Catch me on your doorstep, you see me, let me in
All I wanna do is eat, I'm like a freaky lesbian
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV, need ESPN
They heard I'm 'bout to blow so all my enemies say let's be friends
And all these rappers know just where I'm 'bout to go so catch me then
Where all the girls we knew that screamed fuck you going let me then
I'm definitely in a class of my own, at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just passed the Patron
Ain't nothing given dawg, it's earned if you just living, dog, you learn
I let you niggas see the light, I'm like the prison yard, I yearn
For that living large, but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise, kick back and know your son set
Forever I ain't run yet, and I never will, Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet, you up yet
My punchlines like gut checks I'm raw-dog, I'm rough sex
I'm on deck, I'm up next, I'm God blessed, I'm success
So fuck stress, you can get the fuck from 'round me
And if you listening, know you wondering where the fuck they found me
I'm from the Ville, boy, ay Wale, good looking

[Verse 3: Wale]
Another day up in my ES, wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed, muscles
Your feedback ain't plusing, and you can keep it running
Ha, like a muffler, when we not in summer
They like A-list actors, they not no stunners
Too much practice now for me to malfunction
So any beat that function, I breathe on and puncture
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting, showing you her beauty if she's naked
It's like the view of a painting or a lakehead
This just how beautiful my day is
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or an I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up
Motherfucker, hah!

As often, I do this
I turn a straight prude bitch into a nudist
Foolish, I be on that new shit
And I'm blowing up like bitches we went to school with
Ain't nobody checking for your garbage
Lot of intuition, I ain't even finished college
Never hit the mall and forever get it all
Any broad, bet I lay her like I'm dressin' for the fall, nigga
And I'm all that, hit the passenger door
Shawty was Pinkberry sweet and I ain't lactose
I ain't tryna brag though, I just know I'm that dope
Kick game Bojack, my Bo Jacks Tae Bo
Haha, and it ain't no problem
You race to these broads, I relay and baton 'em
Bitches ain't hearin' one thou'
But when you step out, why these bitches run out?

Yeah, see, breaking up is hard
To move along, it's even harder
It's over, she got colder, now
Can't locate where her heart is
And I'm just being honest
Since we not even talking
My mind won't let you go
Shit, even consider stalking now
You know I be teasing, though
You know that my ego won't
Thought this was forever love
Guess that was just seasonal
She got back with her old boy
She probably had a reason though
Although thought that we would grow
Guess that wasn't feasible
But we ain't gonna be beefing, no
I miss you at my recent show
I speak to CJ often and sometimes
I just want to speak you up
Yeah, hit you up
Or call you up, or send a text
Your new man got my respect
So if I do call it's just a check
Heard that you alright though
My nigga for life though
It's funny how this life go
We love for a while then a light goes
Took me a while just to write those
Pride, I had a fight so
I'mma stop right there and I know you don't care
But I hope you got that bite, boo, ay
[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, tell me about the love of ours
""Contemplate"", I wrote about her
We no longer close or nothing
That's why she ignore my flowers
And my call and my text
Spending her time with him I guess
I regret some shit I did
But darling, is y'all intimate?
Who was better? I know I was
Don't you lie, don't blow my buzz
You ask me who I'm stroking now
I say that the pool is closed
Can we stay broken up?
And all these pages, close them up
I hope we both do learn from this
So my next joint don't got to be so rough
Huh, got to get better with time
Relationships should never rewind
Better leave it all behind
Guess that means you can never be mine
Well, um, there's a but
Without your love it's cold as fuck
Life is a movie we both say ""cut""
But most times darling the sequel sucks20Embed"

I can tell you 'bout the Mach Five
I can show you what them blocks buy
I can tell you 'bout my block ties
I can take you to the far side
Poor decision makin' plaguing niggas' lives
You sellin' crack up on your momma porch

When he really needs to raise his boys
Young thugs with so much talent
Young thugs havin' no balance
Young niggas havin' no fathers
Young niggas catchin' dope charges
Growin' up she say she felt alone
Now she strippin' for that pot of gold

Her mother always wearin' gold
Where I'm from, I guess that's how it goes

Why you lettin' the devil beat you out your soul?
If you don't believe in God then at least believe in odds
This house of our is just a house of cards
Just without the yards, and nice adjacent parks
We was born black, but that shit'll make you dark
Even with a handful of hearts
Mind on the club just to find a little love, my regards
Cause when your P-O-V is poverty
It's like D-O-C a lottery, that D-O-C be lock and key
Finna D-O-P-E, bob and weave and that boxer boxin' free
Up out them rings like it was Rocky III, caught up in the game now
Look at how we came out like olly olly oxen free
Golly, why they watchin' me?
Yeah, yeah, poor decider since like four, five or
Sugar-coated colored edibles
Instead of buildin' up a habit in them vegetables
Now early 30s, my blood pressure's incredible

Turn around and publish bars like it ain't got shit to do with me

And I'll show you where they raise a tool
It'll have a nigga late for the labels or the latest shoes
I'm from an era where gold trinkets could buy attention
And the hoes thinking might blow your winky for a known emblem
Label whores who fuck a sale and suck a store
Lust apparel who dream of Rolls but can't Accord
Or afford a Dodge or a Ford
Where she end up on your knob cause she has never been adored
Lord help us, my generation come to an end
Cause we all selfish but livin' shallow, how we gon' swim?
I mean really, why should I pretend?
Walk a day up in my tennis, my soul is possessed
I'm reppin' my set, no matter who posin' against
Once I got hot, they only good option to vent

Ay Ricky, I'ma flip the mission
How 'bout poor niggas makin' rich decisions?
Yeah, poor niggas makin' rich decisions
That shit right there is more efficient
I think that might be a better description
Poor niggas makin' rich decisions
Can't afford 'em but you still gon' get 'em
That's a poor nigga making rich decisions
Buyin' jewelry but you know your vision
Yeah, on a mission, hah

DMV up, roll up and kick my feet up
This shit was for a ticket, man -- I call that shit that free lunch
I tell a ho to speed up
She slow and she can keep up
We know we always out
But somehow they would never see us
Keep a gold chain, hoes changed, I didn't
They say that karats help your vision
But somehow it made them listen
No this ain't silver, this is my dilemma
Arrogant when I finish
I came from humble beginnings
So it's nothing to finish
I put my hundred percent in
Put my pride in the pen, cuh
And modify your opinion
Trying to give them light and a message
But you rather have some fucking V.V.S.'s
She said I'm charming and I meant it
But she was talking about my pendant
I got geechi on her, came back with thirty chains
Now she attentive, I bet she listen to everything
Straight geechi on her, came back with eighty chains
Now them silly bitches calling me like everyday

Look, she so stingy with vagina
But why it open when them niggas get to shining?
I was hoping you would notice where my mind at
Put money in the book, I bet these bitches wouldn't find it
Look, okay this chain music, fuck how them lame's do it
You chained to it, your brain has been way too influenced
I been dope, cold nigga for sure nigga
But where I'm from there ain't no love for no broke nigga
She seen that geechi shit, ain't been to church since
Pray to whoever got on the biggest of crucifix
Lord Lord forgive us, personalities clash
And my license is suspended, so I hide it
I don't spend it, did I get y'all attention?
She can't escape the chain, shoutout to Mrs. Tubman
Shoutout to Maybach Music, my logic is getting money
Spitting something real, let the people know, and still love it
Shady flow: Johnny Cage, chain flow: Johnny Dang
Ben Baller, six bottles, talk with such expensive slang
I got geechi on 'em, now they notice a nigga
So who that chain change? It ain't both of us nigga
I got geechi on her, came back: a hundred chains
And now these geechi motherfuckers all know my name
Geechi on her, came back: a million chains
I see these geechi motherfuckers all know my name

Working out 9-to-5, keeping them babies fly
Know the time, know what's like, no one notice your plight
No one notice your struggle, no one know what it's like
How you hold in emotion, nine months while holding in life

I can't touch her, so for pleasure, I get special attention
Yeah this the illest bitch alive, I love her freaky side
And the deeper that mean she get the sweeter, just rise

And I know it's double standards when you fucking with us
But I pray these everlasting groupies don't fuck up this love
New Louboutins when she dressin', Louboutin, please correct me
Stretch marks, make her self-conscious, I kiss 'em when we sexing

But, tomorrow's uncertainty promotes the urgency in this shit I'ma say
Perfection doesn't exist if it doesn't consume her
And the truth hurts that this world's mine but, the womb's hers
Ms. Mother Nature, I pray that our daughter's carry and favor your genes
And when you take off your jeans, you get all the me that you need, heh

Oh so there's still hope?
I don't want hope, hope is killing me
My dream is to become hopeless
When you're hopeless, you don't care
And when you don't care, that indifference
It makes you attractive

[Verse 1: Wale]
Uh, a nigga feelin' hopeless
Uh, who am I to change perception?
If a nigga kill a nigga he's another statistic
If his skin's a little different, they gon' say it was self-defense
Nigga feelin' hopeless
Uh, starin' at the idiot box, riddle me this
If a killer was a nigga would niggas still really care
Cause niggas worser than Zimmerman livin' life everywhere
Niggas hopeless
Small niggas with big tools
Couldn't get to Harvard, hard work, he hard whipped
Cause them hardy har's and hard nights are hard to live through
When you hopeless
What we gotta do to be winnin'? Cause all the schools gettin' closed
Dribble a little, coach shootin' at a foe
Cause they chargin' them to hoop at community center
My nigga hopeless
25 bands he was shootin', not a damn givin'
Cousin threw a couple grand at some dancers
Throwin' back their fat ass, is my glasses confused?
We're the hopeless
America's dream and nightmare in the same being
Even when being polite here
Niggas try to bring me down, the life of a pioneer
Lightyears worth of hopeless
Celebrity celebrating disgusts me
The cerebellum invaded with all these fresh things on
Watchin' ""Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta"" as we speak
Nigga we hopeless
Okay, the Steebie show is on
And so my broad rollin' weed now she's mad at me
Cause she seen a scene with Rasheeda baby father
Said, ""You niggas all hopeless""
[Hook: J. Cole]
Got a pocket full of lint again but it make no difference to me
Fallin' out with my friends again but it make no difference to me
Goddamn I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Aw man, I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Got no gas in my tank again but it make no difference to me
Overdraft at the bank again but it make no difference to me
Goddamn I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless
Lord knows I'm hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, hopeless, still I pray

[Verse 2: Wale]
Nigga feelin' hopeless
Like a penny with a hole in it
We as empty as a corazón of a widow
From a soul that she don't know when he's comin' home
He don't got no limit, hopeless
What's a purple heart to a hurt head?
He done done 12 years, he was told 6
Prolly go back in a minute, ain't shit here
Nigga so hopeless
Thoughts are ravaging in the whole crib
Now he post-traumatic and always on the edge
On the pills, some bills, two kids, one leg
Nigga so hopeless
A lot of black cops always clap back
And some foul white cops always on deck
Playin' race card, guarantee you'll make a blackjack
Nigga so hopeless
Cause we ain't 'posed to never have shit
And we ain't vocalise rap
Niggas cause we don't promote unless we drop hits
Nigga hopeless
Look, look at what I go through to show you
Niggas respect money, money respect power
And power, we never given unless a nigga catch, shoot or dribble
We are hopeless
Nah, you ain't out here for the culture
You finna riot, without a purpose
You ain't a mothafuckin' rider, you a fuckin' token, posin'
Nigga hopeless, of course not literal
But why complain about The Man when a nigga want my skin?
The same problems with them I had is out there killin' niggas too
Eat your food, nigga...

If they're gonna judge you for life
Say we can't always be fly
We gon' be good long as them sneakers white

Said, you'll be alright

[Verse 1]
Gucci S. Dots, whole hood had 'em
Ice cream 'fore the hype beasts that's into fashion
Yeah, being for real, yo, try being Pharrell
When your black ass in a back class, the fronting was real
No Lauren London, we was on a budget
You know, sharin' Old Navy, so the army could be fresh in public
Where the sneaker stores and laundromats get all the money
'Cause it ain't 'bout what you're doin' but how ya lookin'
When they love you for your status and your catalog
And everybody got a jersey to play along
Back then the hoes checkin' for your zapatos
So even dirty niggas had the foams, you know?

Viotech trainers on the way to work
And we would quietly complain while Eric would lurk
That was the PG Plaza manager managin' us
Yeah, I'm standin' in Lucky 7's, but slingin' them Lugz
Still have them J's for the low, low, and I could get 'em early
But I'm not without a conscience, I see people out there hurtin'
Got 'em for Penny Foams that was bought at this very store
And I think that was my shift, then again, I'm not very sure
And that's a lot that can get to ya
When you're not sellin' drugs, but the outcome is similar
'Cause out come them niggas with pistols, tellin' you give 'em up
Now out come the moms with tissues 'cause you ain't give a fuck
Free lunch for everyone, income was very ""uh""
On the 2nd and 16th, everyone would have every one
And Reebok would carry pump
And that's not the scary part
These niggas love white shoes so much, they'd be buried in them

I had a lady once stop me on the street. I was wearing white shoes. And she says, ""I'm glad you're sticking with the white shoes."" She says, ""It makes me feel good.""

Why you talking?
Mufucking Groundhog's Day

[Verse]
The most highly underrated of my generation
Behind them crooked smiles niggas neglect to embrace me
Respect is in order now, my liquor is more to y'all
You throwing little shots, we catching some cases
Lot of niggas hate to love me or they love to hate me
Labeled as reckless and crazy by my record label
Doctors say it's bipolar disorder, he diagnosing me wrong
It's obviously depressing counting blue faces
Hey, here go that real shit
Battling anxiety and privately them percocets
Purchased like 30 of them, murdered them in like 30 hours
Weight of the world on my shoulders bet I military press
I remember me and Cole would open for Hov
Everyday a star is born, I guess I died in the womb
I ain't make it on Blueprint, so made me a blueprint
You got you a nice watch, my minutes was finished
I was lost at Interscope
Contemplating on copping a block from Benning Road
Thoughts of suicide cause who gon' want you alive
When niggas you used to ride with cry with all that high shit
Talking down in they interviews, I ain't forget that Scott
Only difference is I didn't get no sympathy calls to get back up
I just heard a song about me on a hip-hop blog from a kid I know
Some niggas say a hip-hop God
It hit home cause there's some truth, this I know
This a cycle, I get psycho when shit get dark
Boy when shit get dark
Like Laurene Powell I've gotten married to a job
I drop my jewels, spit my bars, I get mine off, I be pissed off
Should get more props but still I
Pimp hard, drink hard liquor to forget my thoughts
Push 3 buttons I make the joint spin, Balrog (hey)
Hoes say I'm the realest, most hated on Twitter
Not to cause a situation
But what side of my biracial friends call me they nigga?
Forget it, I'm jih tripping
But my skin is made of chocolate, a copper's bullets is diabetic
My mind busy, I'm sad daily though I deal with it
My therapist terrible, I'm a terrapin, mellow trembling
Real subtle though
Tell them niggas SHINE coming, they in trouble though
I love my brother though, I love my brother though
That's why it's rest in peace to Tommy, we still bumping Cole
[Video Verse]

[Outro]
And they say
For as the sun shines on candle mass day
So far will the snow swirl until May
For as the snow blows on candle mass day
So far will the sun shine before May
Now in layman's terms that means
All you naysaying, instigating, player hating
Niggas be safe though
I'm on my way to Raleigh so grateful for that inspiration
I'll see you at the game bro

A little white chick, a little white wine..

Smoking weed in the suite 'til we out of towels

Fly as shit for no goddamn reason
And y'all aiite - but y'all not like me

Fuckin' with a dude probably the right move
Two times for the chicks with the right bag

Ridin' through the cap, Cap' STEEZ on the mind
Though, I ain't know him but I wish I did
Each one, teach one, may the youth live
On that, Joey Bad', please hold your head
Lost one last summer, livin' ain't fair
While them niggas scared, we forever here
Hate to see you smile, money everywhere
Dream killers out, I see them in the rear
Before I put them in a song, put them in a prayer
Amen

Cause we ain't 'posed to never have shit
Yeah, we ain't 'posed to never (we ain't 'posed to never)
Nah, we ain't 'posed to never have nothin'

You see my focus ain't on them

I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)

Look, look, look
Yeah, I'm focused, it's Folarin here
I reckon your barbershop talk of this
Heavenly Father, may the spirit of God
Help whoever at odds get your guidance, quick
All we need is Keisha, all we need is Becky
All we need is God, and Fed-free fetti
My little buddy live strong, young nigga peddle
He ain't make it in the leagues so the streets wet him
Gettin' wet up on the corner in whatever weather
Before see the jail again, he gonna see the devil
Rah! Been a week since he seen his mother
Uh, and 18 since he seen the other
I'ma pray for him
It's safe to say he got some pain within
It ain't too much that I can say to him
Cause my bank statement don't relate to him
Look, Ralph

I was so fresh, so clean when I stepped on that scene
Pulled up Aston Martin, you could ask them ya'll seen
When I came through this bitch paper tagging on lean
Baddest bitch in the game, nigga that was ya'll dream
Hold up, let me get a feel like Jackson
Hold up, I don't feel these niggas (nah)
Hey Wallace (Yep, what's the problem?)
I'm focused, I'm Kobe, I kill these niggas
Hah, I ain't scared of these niggas
Getting higher than Shaquille O'Neal's field goal percentage
Yeah me nigga, tell the brokest nigga with me
Got a mil plus interest, Meek keep living, get em
When I was dead broke
Used to always tell myself I'ma still be the shit
Told my P.O., she locked me up
I'ma do the time, come home and still be this rich
Still see the bricks, I'ma still be a Mitch
Got these Rico niggas tryna kill me and shit
Hol' up, tryna kill me and shit
Let me get the flow back, I was killing this shit
We was killing them strips
Dropheads, no ceilings and shit
Ain't talking 'bout Wayne, bitch I'm talking them things

Know it's a problem and we notice that
You be goin' too hard and never know when to stop

She got Instagram, niggas in town prolly been through that
So the niggas from outta get the pics from out her
Niggas clickin' they mouses she give a clip in them
It's like that, broad thick as shit
On the real though I'd prolly do some shit to it
But every nigga I follow prolly been through it
For every dirty dog there lies a thirsty bitch
It's like that, and I ain't perfect miss
But to be modest, I ain't worth a bit
Got a son with no father, ain't got no one to watch her
Only care 'bout the comments sittin' under the pic
It's like that, such a narcissist
They don't acknowledge 'til she blog her tits
Can't get any more out her even that equip
But still make it a problem when I ask to hit
It's like that

Can't' work for it, cause you ain't a model
Where your focus at?
I know too many broads that be going too hard

[Verse 2]
He on Instagram, followin' broads that never follow him
Take a pic of the watch, it might get him some box
But what she won't find out, it don't belong to him
It's like that, with all his kicks
In the club with some bottles and like all his pics
We applaud it yeah, you a boss for real
But it's easy to cop livin' out mama's crib
It's like that, on a search for it
Prolly show you his closet, never show you a crib
Yeah the thirst is real, get to twitter and get on every girl in it
It's like that, type of nigga is you?
I'm the type that ain't trippin' cuz I be gettin' the loot
Like I'm already groomed, when I come to the room
Talkin' yellow and bare, my nigga Winnie the wooh!
Tryna build me a pool, tryna get me a chick
Tryna see what to do, tryna kick it a bit
Tryna take it in steps before you gon' think I know your man

Would you rather love or just someone to like your pictures? Yeah
Met you in the club, I don't expect you to stop hitting 'em
So hit me when you buzzed, you know I'm buzzed
You know I'm wit' it
Your heart numb and I'm numb
So we be done, but I won't finish, yeah
Met a lot of women, yeah, got a lot of niggas

My heart severely scorned and you the cause of it
Goodbye, my baby, I'll abandon you, that's when you forced to care

That I miss you, malnourished
I need your flesh on my lips so I'm better (Yeah)
And I read you every month just like I paid for a subscription
And I've been on every page so it's no way you hide your issues
But yet and still though
Bottled emotions tend to spill out, but you get to sipping
And I know it's close to being over, I can see it's different
But obviously, when you be pourin' up, you get in your feelings
So who's the villain, girl?

But I'd like to take the time to describe to y'all my favorite woman
Look, teeth, white and bright and still talk to me like we back home
And the weave? That's optional
'Cause my only concern's that her head's strong
And her feet? Lemme see, course you know a nigga like 'em clean
And I can understand a little bruise
You've been running through a nigga's mind all damn week
And ooh, I won't OD, you'll get D, young as 19

Be sure to leave your armor and your woman penetrated
I give her back, I hate her, poof, get out of here
I say congratulations, your old lady renovated
You niggas lazy, my boy, why you hatin', my guy?
You bought her Commes des Garçons
She come and play with your heart
I'm far from a popular artist, one of the hardest, no lesser
And I saw your woman, I caught her low like a Cardigan sweater
Call her whatever you want, I got my revenue up
In Beverly Hills, my ceilings like the Beverly brothers
Since day one, Folarin been the same one

But when your wheel is a fortune, you ne'er gotta say jack

You's a fraud, you's a thorn in my side
I'm a knife in your back, I'm that turn of the knob
On the door when the boys from the corner come rob you
And tie you up to something, now stop with all that fronting
That big money talk should be reserved for those that got it
But when you really got it, you ain't pressed to talk about it
That's why I hear that capping on your raps and highly doubt it
The game too crowded
I'm 'bout to get all the way the fuck up out it
No ifs, ands or buts about it
30 mill on a deal depending on how the tour was routed
I seen your watch when you first dropped, that shit was clouded
Which means you used to fugazi shit
Fake-it-'til-you-make-it type, I shoot through you crazy with
Hollow tips, no holler backs, just hotter raps
I gotta black to make sure every dirty dollar stacked
Y'all aiming for the stars, bitch, I'm aiming at your Starter cap
Run, nigga, run like a fucking black quarterback (Uh)
Stereotypical, but to hear me is pivotal
I will bury you niggas and come and air out your funeral
Have your homies on stretchers right next to Roman numerals
IVs, IVs, it's the reason why nobody try me, try me
Have a nigga screaming, ""Lord, why me? Why me? Cole did me grimy
He took it too far, he treat them bullets like they Siamese""
Back to back, I clap like that's a wrap
But no video shoots, just hoodies and boots
Putting your troops in pine boxes

Look, I just want to make you better
I think I could save you
But I think I'm bipolar. I love you then I hate you
Grew with disdain though I hate whoever ain't you
Hate when I can't date you but I also need my space too
I made room for this love. How foolish of me
And every woman looking at you knew that you was lucky
So check the verse miss. I ain't say I'm perfect
But you was low on love, what I do; reimbursed it
And now it hurts to be around or converse with ya
And what’s worse is before this, I had worshiped you
Now war missiles hand guns and grenades
The walls I couldn't break em or take em apart with a tank
Now momma told me be careful who you love
G said just rap it up, these bitches actin up
And as for us, we was different though. Things have gotten difficult
Try to be Mr. perfect intercontinental, hold up
You spend your time with your friends all the time
And all that time with your friends put my momentum on decline
My minds gone evil. You changed with the season
You had a new clear heart. Guess I was Hiroshima

So now I need some Xanies, some Remy, and some reefer
So when this war is over I'm not PTSD'ing
And I don't wanna leave her. But you know what got me wonderin'
I'm scared to lose love but even more scared to love again
Why we gotta argue
Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fightin' for
So tell me why are we at war

[Seinfield Skit]

Yea, they do whatever they want, whenever they want
And nobody else can stop it
I'm catching myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from
And I ain't got the gall to tell my godzilla byebye
So I'm hurting. Me effort is apparent she not fertile

The anger I've adopted. The feelings been aborted
So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up
They call me better now. See when everything is stopped
And your loves in hindsight and you see everything its not
Notice everything it wasn't. Realizing why it shouldn't ever be again
Cause in the end its not about what you put in
Fuck kissing and hugging. They love pushing your buttons
New love is so beautiful. Time just makes it ugly
But fuck it I accept it. no longer will neglect it
If a period is late then I will mark it with a question
That mean I never trust em. And if you ever love them
Know that favorite girlfriends turn into crazy baby mommas
The war
Now why we gotta argue. Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you. I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for
So tell me why are we at war?

Just another product of this matrix
This maze I'm in amazes me at times
I just wanted to be at peace with you
And if I gotta settle for a piece of you
Then I gotta say peace to you
With all due respect I do respect you enough to expect
Effort is all I ask
If we gonna last more, I gotta ask for more
And if that means that I'm askin for too much
I'm sure we'll end up as our last or...past
We bash
We blast
We shoot
We lose
We pass.....war5Embed"

Titles for soap operas, why is you so dramatic
Why is you over-exaggerating with all the chatter
Slappin' me on my back, hoping that something happen
Give me a second or two, that's why I ain't messin' with you
Hangin' me on so you can holler domestic abuse
See it's time that a nigga roll
Things have gone awry and you tryna change a nigga role
Never trust a bitch just tryna be a side bitch
They just fly enough to out-connive the prior one
And it be fine to just get high and let the time run
But all that bullshit cryin' got me tryna tell you I'm done

[Bridge: Wale]
Just give me a second to cool off
If you respect me then take a second and cool off
Sit and reflect, these imperfections is with us all
Wrap up a blunt and we wrap it up when it's - hol' up
Give me a second to cool off
If you respect me then take a second and cool off
Sit and reflect, these imperfections is with us all
Light up another and we discuss when it's all gone
[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
Oh baby
Keep it cool cuz I'mma lose it, you gon' lose on my love
Oh baby
Keep it cool cuz I'mma lose it, you gon' lose on my love

[Verse 2: Wale]
Nah this ain't no deep shit, this ain't no we shit
This is that honesty, that's how it's gotta be shit
Gotta say peace to you when you on that weak shit
I'm on that see you out in public and don't speak shit
You ain't my main joant, we got a understandin'
She catchin' feelings and now them feelings is hard to manage
She broke up with her man, threw me all in the middle
Let's keep it real doe, you probably thinkin' I'd be your pillow
Thinkin' I'd be your shoulder, you tell me what's on your temple
In turn you givin' me lip our bodies is inconsistent
So pardon my starin' but see your body is so prolific
A body magnificent make designer she worth expenses
And every woman over 20 want a perfect man
And 20 something women just want someone understand
But as you live and learn, and you love and lose
By 40 somethin' you lucky if someone give a damn
So we can just enjoy the company of one another
And I only answer the phone if it's Warner Brothers
Rozay and some others, that mean it's numbers comin'
See money talkin' that little box, end of discussion

Cannon
M-M-Maybach Music
Huh, huh, huh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Sometimes I get so fucking paranoid
Reminiscing on how them bricks keep going back and forth
I asked the Lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, talking laws of attraction
The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in in '06
Planted my flag, bitch I'm taking no shit
I toted them toolies, I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, my bank account Jewish
Niggas is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Hyman, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sipping lean
Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam
[Hook: Omarion]
This thing of ours, oh (Oh)
It's so mafioso (Yeah)
You ain't never know though (No) never gon' know so (No)
No never, no never, no never, no, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uh, Ralph, look
This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper
They don’t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle
Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing
Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5'11"", what the fuck you guys scared of?
I'm a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip-hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama
Getting up in they mental, get 'em out of they garments
Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama
Just know that D.C., Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, natty dread, got no barber
I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us
When you young and you black, they see you as a target
So before them Foamposites, get ya lawyers in order
Ralph, Genius
[Hook: Omarion]
This thing of ours, oh (Oh)
It's so mafioso (Yeah)
You ain't never know though (No) never gon' know so (No)
No never, no never, no never, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Nas]
The don of all dons
Since y'all wanna call me something, all a sudden
Niggas ball and stunting, y'all just started pulling on Havanas
Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart? I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying
Gold medallion over my son chest
He'll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me?
I never owned the concept, I was here
I’m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other, my kid to me
I am my children through history
Upstanding men and stand up women
I am existing, I was conceived
To break bread with kings, and make connections
We haven’t met yet, my reputation you’ve stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction, that’s enough
But every male is not a man
So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand
This thing of ours
[Hook: Omarion]

It's so mafioso (Yeah)

Huh, random shit like my man say

Look, I was ridin' through wherever like my situation better
Bet they make amends when they see you makin' money
Romanelli custom, make it (Buy it)
Haters (Priceless) a hundred for the butters
I don't be with squares ('Less I'm sittin' on my luggage)
See that's a little different, Damier was a cover
Now won't you tell me somethin' 'bout the joint that you was thumpin'
Yeah Ralph, you know the girl that always askin' 'bout some money
Yeah, yeah, man cut that talk, I ain't ever spendin' nothin'
But some gas and some muh'fuckin' rubbers (Man)
Check it on the dash, 120 out speedin' (Shit)
You play phone tag a minute, was tryna see it
Told her we can be low, Pinot and rollin' weed up
(Did you get her on cam?) No brag but Tarantino
Now you know so we know, told me I can keep it
(Well nigga, did you smash?) I smashed (But did you eat it?)

Man, took her to the room, make her bust it wide open

Hold up (Wait, chill, let it marinate)
White girl with a booty, call it carrot cake (Yup)
Black girl with a booty, call it double fudge (Yup)
Brought my nigga along, we havin' double fun
Killed that pussy, died with its eyes open
Hopped out the pussy fly with my fly open
You hopped out the pussy fly with your fly open?
With her legs in the sky like the suicides open
Suicide doors, suicide whores
We all up at the crib (It's a quarter past four)
Chillin' (Smokin') drinkin'
Like Jay-Z, off-key I'm singin'
Okay, I met this girl named Sara
Did she pull up in the Panamera?
Nah, that's another broad (Who?) This another broad
Her? (Little yellowtail, but I ain't hit it raw)

Tell me 'bout the brin-oad you caught up at your last show
She was playin' hin-ard to get it (I dig it)
(You sweat it?) A little, blame it all on the liquor
Shit, I was so faded, couldn't keep my eyes open (Right)
Playin' eye to eye 'til she poke it out for me (Right)
Forty-five later, she was jumpin' all on me
It was on (If it's on, then put on for the homie)
Okay, next time I got ya, I just caught in the moment (Bet)
When I bring friends in, her friends will get focused (Word)
Dogs will be dogs (Huh?) shones will be shonin' (Huh?)

Da-da-da-dum
You gotta ask Jake One for the beat though
I don't know if he gon' be cool with lettin' me, I don't know, man
It's really some album shit that we just, takin' it up

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Yeah, winter schemes for my summer dreams
Winning seems to become routine, it's my thing
Underdog, never under y'all
I touch down in your city like a hundred yard
Dash, never punt at all, last thing I need is four downs
My baddest just graduated from Georgetown
Grad school 'cause a nigga like 'em grown up
I'm seeing rappers in the gym tryna tone up
I've seen rappers on the road, no one showin' up
I feel partially to blame, let me own up
I'm sorry, brand new Ferrari
Really though I'm just frontin', I really don't mind discussin'
That Bugatti in that Beyoncé video was just for stuntin'
Scared to mash the gas 'cause if I fucked around and crashed
That woulda been my ass, that whip is 'bout a million cash
Million cash? And dawg, I just got rich
How you gonna take a million from me, dawg? I just got this
Came a long way from that weak ass advance
Was in the Honda on that LIE passing fast
Wasn't bout the money then 'cause he had the chance
Built it from the ground up, no hit singles
Just a lot of fucking gifts, nigga, no Kris Kringle
Cole, I'm the reason that your old bitch single
Gave her dick, made her whole shit tingle, ya wan' feel me?
Born sinner, doubt this diamond chain gon' heal me
Lord, let me kill the game and pray the game don't kill me
Huh, multi before I die bitch, believe that
These rappers rich as fuck but don't know where they seeds at
It's a shame, niggas lame, this is fame for ya
I gotta be the only one that didn't change for ya
I saw ya sortin' through trash and brought change for ya
Open up they lane, do I gotta say names for ya?
Ha, and I ain't even flexin'
Plottin' on that Warm Up 2, I'm just stretchin'
Fourth quarter, so much due, but fuck stressin'
I just step into the ring and do my muh'fuckin' thing
My muh'fuckin' thing, ha
Fourth quarter, so much due, but fuck stressin'
I just step into the ring and do my muh'fuckin' thing
[Interlude: Wale & J. Cole]
Uhh, Wale, kill these niggas man
Uhh, woo!
Gifted!
[Verse 2: Wale]
Yah! Spring greening but I'm winter frigid
And with this summer album got me booking all them bitches
Uhh, 'til I'm bored with bitches, my parking garage official
Boy I play with foreigns and I feel just like Kawhi Leonard
God-given talent, momma gave me passion
Got me a, Rihanna feature, y'all should see my demographic
Copy us, dap me up, rapping niggas done got me fucked
Half these niggas is carbon copy
Faking a nigga would be redundant, right?
Ah, I'm tryna shed a bunch of light
In a country where niggas follow models and hype
You know? Trends and that shit
Niggas wearing leather down in a 110
Hahah, just a classic-ass nigga
Rappin' circles 'round these squares, out of shape and I ain't trippin'
Shoe game prolific, this Hublot a ticket
This Ron Simmons meets Richard Simmons
Go Google their differences
As I maneuver the industry, few is against me, I ride
With shooters but truthfully, tryna get loot out of Disney, I'm high
I'm tripping, I'm fried, forgive me, that's right, you with me
A cold world if I ain't slide by your chimney, we gifted
Tryna distribute what Allah has given me, listen
But some of the bars are synagogues to a godless opinion
Dig it, in layman's terms
Man these lames can't contain these words, new slaves we were
We was shut down, we was not proud for those things we stood
'Til I bust out then bust down that chain, we good
New black soul, new black soul, new black soul
Ain't toot my horn but I'm the new Satchmo
This Bishop Tutu with a 2Pac flow
You niggas think too slow, you Pikachu but I'm Picasso
Peep how I do it, got a deep mind so I free my quotes
Peep my approach, I'm thinking more like Lee Iacocca
Come see my show, this shit look like that door knob broke
There's hoes and hoes, and I'm sure I'm bout to know like four
You P-Myers, replace me then that four-five show
And I'm just saying if I don't make it, I'll still feed my folks
Still I keep shit real, I ain't never been a sucker though
Gold albums on my bronze game, fucking stupid
And I'll fucking do it, new legend shit got me juiced
Whoever got problems with Folarin come find me, pursue it
Remind you of a time there was knowledge in music
And I do it for the niggas they promise the future
So, new black soul, new black soul, new black soul
And any bitch that got me twisted only grew my fro

If Michael Jackson was alive right now
He would want us to smoke one for him
Double M, Self Made 3, let's go

[Hook: Wale]
Folarin in this muh'fucker
I'm just talking to you muh'fuckers
And if it don't make your niggas proud
Then this should never be allowed

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, misunderstood, just over heads
Just in your ears, although you deaf
Killing my fitteds with no intent, I groom better
Like I'm under a goal post, I am too officials
Extra point nigga, I forever kick it
As far as lyrics, I'm quite content with celibate living
Wittingly unfuckwittable with these syllables
And fuck your syllabi, little nigga been to school
The realest dude in the room in my groove
And all my women come frequently as the summer's moon
Keep talking 'bout ambition shit
Brown women, brown liquor, I'm innocent
And all these bitches don't know which body part they gon' pick
Invite them to my mind, but they end up on my dick, haha
Reminiscing upon my man Slick
We from the jungle, the grimiest animal a pig
As-salamu alaykum though
Try to hit the Jummah, Muhammed said you faking though
Somebody said, ""You winning, why BOA pray so much?""
I say, ""You tripping, such winnin make niggas prey on us""
Dreams fulfilling they ain't capable of
As I renovate a model but do raise up your cup
Hah, tell them niggas we never giving up
And never lose us on this never-ending revenue hunt

Still talking to you muh'fuckers

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, I did it for my family
I'ma take my mama to the Grammy's
And shoutout everybody that ever said that I can't be
And show her everything that she taught me done came in handy
Yeah, everything fine and dandy
Hurricane flow, dropped my album, it was Sandy
On another level so they couldn't understand me
I guess I gotta take what I want it like Meyer Lansky
Shore is 'bout to get back, put your feet up and sit back
Barely went gold but I got money just like I went plat'
You get that? Look like I went diamond just where my wrist at
I eat a nigga first four bars without a Kit-Kat, pause
Let me get that, aw, how you get that far?
Cause when I ran out of gas, I had to push that car
And when I ran out of cash, I had to push that hard
Like Chris Paul when he push that ball, you dig?
I ain't even used to live that far, you dig?
I learned to hustle when I took that loss, I did
18when I took that charge
Time to retire old niggas like they did Brett Favre, you dig?
New flows and new hoes
Now I'm switching Ferraris just like I do clothes
I run a business my nigga, I don't just do shows
I don't just rhyme nigga, all I know is grind nigga
I'm gone
[Verse 3: Rockie Fresh]
I'm looking at the plan like this shit might work
But if it don't work then this shit might hurt
We made first and goal now we gotta convert
Gotta get a couple mil' then go for dessert
I'm tryna break the bank, I ain't breaking the news
That negative attention be the reason we lose
Instead of paying bills, niggas wanna buy shoes
If it's money over bitches, is it that hard to choose?
Nah, give these fuck niggas some fame
Nine times out of ten, they wouldn't even sustain
You can tear they ass apart and let the pussy remain
Until the industry fuck 'em and then they no one again
I always been me, I was never ashamed
I understand that no man's path is the same
And when you not lying then you harder to tame
If you ever tell the truth then you free in the game
Yeah, nigga don’t be a statistic
Have yo main bitch sending me pictures
Feeling futuristic, might buy me a Fisker
Or a time machine to make the process quicker
I ain't with the waiting but I stay patient
I take work trips, I don't take vacations
I'm headed to the top where I stay stationed
Yeah, nigga I stay stationed
And I ain't with the drama, don't look back for that
The flow got more crack than the trap you at
I'm done with bitter bitches, it's a wrap for that
If you a angry bird, it's an app for that
I waited for a minute for this plan to hatch
And now I'm back with a brand new batch, yeah
And it feel good when it go like that
I spend quick and make the dough right back, uh
[Verse 4: J. Cole]
This verse never before rehearsed, it was wrote on site
To slit a nigga throat on sight
Took a whole lot of punches like the Cotto fight
Cole World, zip your coat up tight
I put your soul on ice, illiterate, the boy don't write
Never met a beat that the flow don't like
It's Cole, Young C.O., L.E., call me Neo
And if I ain't the one, I'm the prototype
Woo, insane how I rhyme
All I do is brainstorm then I rain down lines
Shame y'all lying, me I'm the truth
Dog-eat-dog world nigga, we on the loose
Niggas don't wanna hang, I'm the tree, I'm the noose
You little pups couldn't pee on my roots
Touch the people, I could be a masseuse
Thoughts black, I should be in The Roots
While y'all foulin', me I just shoot
Fallon, Jimmy nigga
Asked for it nice, now it's gimme nigga
Once poor, now it's plenty nigga
Still want more, no Demi nigga
Serve niggas quick like Denny's
Got pennies for my thoughts, now look what I done bought
Did the most with what I was taught
A Carolina nigga bound to be the greatest, this a hell of a start

[Interlude: J. Cole]
It's Cole, World, nigga

If I told you I wanted to talk to you
You know, you think I'm tryna holla at you
And maybe I am but
You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like
Short days, long nights
By the phone, no call
Need a clear mind cause I been blind, got me goin' down that road
Heart made of stone
Far away from home
Black woman you cold
Every problem that you ever had with another man I gotta face
Started off on thin ice
I'm still here but I can't skate
Slow sink, can't breathe, no remorse, don't think
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat
Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give, while she nurse the wounds by them
Tried them didn't work
Got impossible standards
Nothing I'ma do is gon work
Diary of a black girl

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow
[Verse 2: Wale]
Raised by a momma who, who
Hates her baby father so, so
She don't have a problem with, with
Saying fuck a nigga quick, quick
I'm just tryna be the one who never run, but you run away from me
Your girlfriend's man cheat, cheat
Why not me the same thing
She can't see in me, what I see in her
This pain she inherit can't be reversed
I can't even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers that played ya
The irony in that is that I ain't even that, but you put it those pages
Wife, you deserve the label but, but you been hurt before so you sore and don't feel your able
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing I ever do works
Diary of a black girl

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow
[Verse 3: Wale]
See all I ever wanna do is be relevant
Just tell me that I ever meant anything
Or that you could ever see me and you in another light
But it's like the dark women endures the darkest nights by the wrong man
And see mostly all of them have made you somewhat incapable of a first impression
What I do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna
Just intentions to impress you, if capable
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind
With such an ugly picture in it and
Money, nothing I buy can buy me more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say, but believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gon shine anyways
And every day that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary
The day before is better than the present
So anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences
No key for release
No reason to be around
Her minds in the clouds
She writes it all down
In her diary

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out

Aye
Don't ask me about my love life
(Hol' up!)

[Verse 1]
It’s complicated to find a lady in my generation
That’s not preoccupied with social clout
We almost fazing out from the high we get from love and conversation to go on IG galavanting for likes and shit
Oh, it’s complicated
I’m tryna say I need loyalty like Clyde Barrow was tryna get when Bonnie was shot up riding shotgun with him
My problems are justified but, I gotta admit
I got someone who loves me so effortless
But, I’m so messed up from another chick I feel like such a bitch ass nigga
That my exes got the power with no effort to decline the next shawty I get
So, I’m guarded and shit
But, never mind that cause you're a goddess and shit
What I’m tryna say is I like you but it’s complicated
Foundation on all my pillows, still your tender face is flawless when the sky kiss you
Should I bury you in compliments or buy gifts or
Just let you tell me bye and for that time I’ll miss you
My life is fairly complicated
You show too much of your heart I promise they confiscate it
I am young, black, and accomplished baby but
I’m not the type to bring home to mama
I’m just crazy cause I’m broad crazy
Monogamy’s kind of hard for me
When I start throwing them curves that’s when they caught feelings
I got famous at a young age I’m spoiled
I get paid, don’t go out so the club scene I’m bored of
I don’t believe in unicorns nor pure love, but more so the latter, seen Porzingis from courtside
I got missed calls from porn stars and church girls
You’d be surprised who get the wildest and squirt more
[Bridge]
Let’s be honest shawty
I got bitches you got niggas don’t be modest shawty
Don’t care about your IG pictures I don’t follow anyway
'Cause, if I really like you I don’t like your pictures, dig it?

[Verse 2]
I believe that love is complicated at best
And at it’s worst it’s a permanent burning in your chest
I pray to earn that from somebody someday
But, somehow someway I no longer have a heart to invest, it’s miles away
The smiles is fake and my job ain’t real
Why would you think I’ll find a woman who is?
I’m high today
Tomorrow I’m chill cause my job get real
What mature woman would put up with my shit?
I mean I’m damaged goods
I mean, I’m rather good at being just kind of good to women who deserve more from me
But, I see you as something more than a purring kitty
You hate my state of mind, somehow you think the world of me

[Outro]
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
It’s complicated
Just be honest shawty

Ayo, we good? Let me know when that drop
Yeah, louder (Hol' up)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Talk to me different, let's come up together
Fuck yo' ex nigga if you fuck me better
Let's go to Neiman's, let's go to Lenox
Spend a whole check and run a play to get the next one
Let's create the vibe, let's not take our time
Let's spray paint the Trump Towers, letters U and I
It's you and I 'til it's suicide
Or 'til the cra— pull us over and no one around, bang
We woke, shawty, protest and party
I know you love nostalgia, I got you Barney's
Get it? My bitch witty, her bitches with it
A snake is on the slippers if the snake ever get near me
Please tell me I got you, that's all for intuition
She tell me ""I got you"", I trust her intuition
And I promise to God I follow her intuition, so
I tell her I got her with Prada and tuition, hold up
[Chorus: Jacquees & Wale]
Can you be someone, I can hide my fears with
And if they got us on the run, we could still chase our dreams
Black Bonnie, yeah, yeah
Do I see my black Bonnie? Yeah
My black, Bonnie, Bonnie, yeah (Bonnie, talk to 'em)

[Verse 2: Wale]
I'll talk to you different, but never extra
She like the fact I get aggressive but I'm not possessive
Bad, but she modest, nasty and honest
Black Bonnie Parker, black Bonnie Rotten
Cash at the stash spot, she never snatch a quarter
'Cause loyalty is e'rything and e'rything before it
The world never love me 'cause girls only lust
But you a woman, I got no will to show me to trust
Bang, I'm woke, shawty, I'm growin' and maturin'
Of course we not bank robbers, they hate us 'cause we colored
Really should leave the city, really would if you with it
Really could never get lost, I follow what you feelin', yeah
She tell me, ""I got you, I got this intuition""
And I tell her my body count ain't nobody business
And I promise to God I follow her intuition, and
Graduated from Prada, now Bonnie got the wisdom (Black queen shit)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Can you be someone, I can hide my fears with
And if they got us on the run, we could still chase our dreams
I just need someone (I just need), I can hide my fears, baby
And if they got us on the run, we could still chase our dreams
Black Bonnie, yeah, yeah, I see
Do I see my black Bonnie? Yeah, I see
Do I see my black Bonnie? Yeah, I see you
[Outro: Wale & Jacquees]
Look, shawty
I know we not felons but I definitely see you as my best friend, confidant and co-defender (Do I see my black Bonnie?)

I ain't with the talking
See, I'm just trying to focus
Cause the loudest nigga in the room is usually the brokest
Tryna stay clear of my foes
And these shape-shifting hoes
Y'all can't stick to no G code
See them snakes show when you mow
Get my taste from all of my bitches
My mates calling me gifted
February cold as my heart
That's why your date is probably missin'
'Le Folarin be trippin'
Man I take cigars, start fillin'
I got a green bag with them blue strands
Man I smoke that Marjorie Simpson
Got a broken heart that needs fixin'
And I don't rely on no bitches
And I don't reply to most BBMs
So when you see an ""R"", don't be trippin!

3M's on my New Balance
I'm here to shine when I'm tracking
What you doing when Ross drop a hundred thousand
And you know you supposed to be stacking!
I should Michael Jordan these rappers
Man I'm twice as cold as these rappers (Haha, hold up)
Let me wipe my nose with these rappers
And I like the hoes that need passion
And I like my girls with ambition
See money talk and these days
You thought that shorty wasn't listening?

Top of the dome wit it, or wroten lyrics
They ain't grossing a million liquid, don't form an opinion
I'm sort of a genius, nothing short of a legend
Sort of Tommy Lasorda
The way I'm sorting these pitchers
Pictures whatever, fuck it my speech is off
Weekend trippin to wherever, only heaven is far
Metaphors in every color, these indelible bars
Jordan 4 seated floorside sitting with Mars
Only fear is mediocrity
So every time I got a beat I feel like I don't gotta sleep
You keep praying on your break, I hope you got a sling
Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks
Sort of like Socrates in a Prada tee
You can't kick it, your pockets thinner than soccer tees
People fucking with me, they ain't fucking with you
Lyrically top hmm, being generous too
I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room
Made some moves, now I'm known to spit December in June
Rented a coupe, cool, met me a chick
Always keep a rubber, word to Telly In Kids
If you gon do it you gon do it, go handle your biz
Or smoke some purp take a Percocet and Xanax and chill
For real, you real then you don't need to say it
It's something to be great, it's nothing to be famous..
[Chorus]
Fuck fame, fuck money
Fuck everything anyone can take from me
It ain't hard to make money
We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary

[Verse 2]
Zoning my second bottle, focused still on tomorrow
Sober thoughts keep me anxious, Moet gon' keep me calmer
Poetry keep her honest, these readings Stevie could draw up
Don't see this deeper than music, don't hear it but feel the author
I don't hear no talking, we just hear them barking
And you know you run shit when they pay you good for walk-ins
Failure is not a option, success is just a process
Say ""yes"" one time they use you, say ""no"" one time they plotting
Didn't make it through college, still debating my progress
End some friendships with homies, made some haters with albums
Limitation's for cowards, this is Che mixed with Malcolm
This is anti Mark McGwire it takes patience for power
Zoning my 6 -rillo legendaries forever
Roll a nick of that lala - that's how I plays it - mellow
Niggas plotting against you, hate you but never tell you
And I know my haters want to make my heart beat acapella
Hella proper, my garment is propeller of chopper
Cause I hella copped em so I could be way flyer than all them
I aspire for awesome and require some flossing
Only way they gon listen, find it highly unfortunate
Tryna see if real lyric spittin' can buy me a Porsche
Tryna see if I get my critics as silent as auctions
I decided to boss up, life's a bitch and I court her
Don't always fuck me good, I'm just too cheap to divorce her

Good morning, baby
I thank God I'm alive to greet you with the sun
She is but a flower, and I love her cause she--
And we both agree this rap shit is all me
But the seed of this beautiful world is ours
My black Bonnie
Dream big and follow through even bigger
15 years of slavery for you lady
I put in work to be your nigga
May the sun kiss you, unconditional
I pray each and every lyric get to you
On this third rendition
For you and your ambition both, bloom

[Hook]
Baby, let your hair down, let it loose
There's no need to be scared now, cause I'm with you
And there's no judgement here, love, you are free
To be as wild and crazy as you wanna be
So baby let me see you bloom for me

[Verse 1]
To whom it may concern
Let me thank your mom for the beauty you inherited
Let me call her up and be like, ""Excuse me Mrs. Um...
You don't know me, but...
Thank you for your flower, but I'm tryna be your sun""
Now wait, wait, know what you're 'bout to say
Male entertainers entertain everything
But that ain't the case, let me put it this way:
If I'm tryna see you bloom, why would I do it with shade?
Don't play, uh, nah I won't stay long
The pollution that you use to I illuminate such
Beautiful the evolution of your bud
Remove your make-up I need that human nature
Look, me and you just ain't enough
We fruitful as youth let's accumulate  some
Tell me 'bout your roots, and how you've came up
I call you my flower, cause you're my boo, k?
Good

Baby, let your hair down, let it loose
There's no need to be scared now, cause I'm with you
And there's no judgement here, love, you are free
To be as wild and crazy as you wanna be
So baby let me see you bloom for me

[Bridge]
(Be my flower, I'll be your sun)
Let me see you bloom for me, bloom for me

[Verse 2]
Just let me hold you in a dark place
And when it's cold let me warm thee
I know we both come from hard times
Cause I'm aroused you a rose of the concrete
Thorns probably on fleek, study and I go on three
I can hit it quick or chill and give you energy
Fresh out of college and they sweat you, now you got degrees
Busy to follow me, I'm tryna pollinate so won't you holla when it's gotta be
Honey, sweet thing, let's get into it
We can do whatever, be it intellect or intimate
Levitate your habitat, just know who you dealin' with
This sort of photosynthesis don't show up with the filter in ya
What, me and you just ain't enough
We fruitful as youth let's accumulate some
Tell me 'bout your roots, and how you've came up
I call you my flower, cause you my boo, 'kay?

You don't have to worry about comfort
I'm the safest place that you wanna be
No longer do you have to wonder
Just open up and spread your wings

Dear sweetheart, what's up, boo?
What you up to? More club moves?
I call her, no answer
Her phone in the bag, she dancin'
It's four now, the clubs over
I call her, but oh, hold up
Y'all know what, ignore button
Or the phone die, let's hope for it
That Damier bag I bought her
Caught the attention of those niggas on it
That cell phone that I bought
Is probably filled with some other niggas numbers
So it leaves me to wonder
Why do I still promise to love her?
Cut me off every time I'm talkin'
Which means she ain't never hear nothing
I say stay, she wanna leave
She get her point across so I gotta let her be
I'ma let her be by herself in peace
But five years from now I bet she see
When the club gets played
The things you crave are no longer escapes
And no longing for dates
You want a husband, but no one has a cape
Now you wonder and wait
And I ain't tryin' to hear what you want me to say
It feels good to be over you, babe
So play this shit while you contemplate
Contemplate, contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate

Them people, they talkin'
Them lights, they on me
This life I chose, but I ain't know 'til I found it
To be honest, I'm modest
One hater for every nigga on it
One day everybody is applaudin'
The next day you is everybody target
Why bother, why talk to 'em
Where God at, I need to call Him
My knees on the ground, dear Father
Don't let me break, please make me stronger
How much longer will it linger
Well my heart is giving, will they believe it
When my song is over will they need me
Watch how quickly they find a new leader
Questioning the whole meaning
In the Viper Room, just me and River Phoenix
With Courtney Love in Lake Washington
With a note there and I'm thinking of reading
This ain't hard, Chris Benoit
Heath Ledger said the nights gon' be dark
Feel the size of a Phyllis Hyman note
Apollo Theater I just might not go
Franky Lymon, the limelight gets old
Cold so in a while I'm schizo
I can't cope, I can't think; I can't breathe, this ain't me
This ain't easy, I'm thinking; am I doing this for them or me
I can't think, am I doing this for them or me

That bottom half is fishy, what, you a mermaid?
Getting on my level, joe, Nuvo new and yellow too
They not pulling in no green like smoking when that 'rello broke
Never did I pedal coke but Tony Lewis said I'm dope
And Tony Jr. said I'm the hope, big homie Hov' said I am close
And I got that bait, they all bad
And they gon' fall in and out of love like my partner Taz
They need something to keep, I need something to grab
That's the end of my speech, I'ma need you to clap

[Verse 3: Wale]
I ain't gon' stop 'til the town get on
These jawns here not found at the mall
Shorty I'm a dog but don't handle no broad
I be calling out game like Miles at the farms
Yeah, I'm stuntin' though, shawty from 124
Make her cum a bunch of times, she buys me a bunch of clothes
Girl stop being fallacious, this Mercedes is spacious
Black and white through the city, guess this gentrification
That fire flow, the finest women I adore
I'm cool with all these broads in here
But I do not date Lucaya hoes

[Hook]
Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out
We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up
(Go shine, go shine, go shine your light on me
Go shine your light on me)
A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice
Same one that get all the hate
Through it all I illuminate - away
(Go shine, go shine, go shine your light on me

Nah nig, nah nig
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga
Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga
We ain't fall out so you still my nigga
Don't always call you but you've been my nigga
You're still the same, nigga, it's just the trust
[Verse 1]
Nigga when you work hard
Used to get the outfit up off Curt Bone
We done came a long way from the all day store
And now spending 8 somethin' out Bergdoff
Word up, pray to God that my set good
Stand close to my rivals
Like you got a job they would kill for
It's all good cause the flow is to die for
My God, nigga life like a dice roll
And it's twice hard throwin' 'em with mics on
I hit 'em with the rap, everybody slept
Then I came back, killin' everybody's nap like a hot comb
At Saks 'bout to cop more
And cop more if they got more
And come back if they got more
Middle finger to them folks, tell 'em Gabos
Cause this game ain't based on sympathy
Know that fame will steal your energy

[Hook]
Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out
Hold my city down now we see the whole city up

[Verse 2]
At 21, played running back
24, I had the city mad
Slim Charles in The Wire now
You could say me and him brought the city back
Used to hustle in hand-me-downs
Now I'm whippin' the Camry 'round
Hit licks in Baltimore
Gettin' Hip-Hop chicken in like Kevin Liles
Uptown, I learned a lot
Suburbs taught me good
The white girl destroyed the black neighborhood
So white boys can run the world
White cops is goin' to war
I write thoughts and put 'em in songs
And the devil around the corner
It's all good cause the God is livin' in you
Cops can look in the bag
Tricky to man so can you read a mind
And they used to go to Madness, and I ain't really have it
Somehow they let another Eddie advance
Well I shine for the niggas that passed
So my niggas in the pen got me pushin' a pad
Back in the crack era, daddy whippin' a cab
But now I'm pushin' a camper doin' a similar route
One time, Junkyard meets Jay Hov
Marion Berry meetin' with Barry O
This is Lil Wayne meets Wayne Perry
This is Bad Brains from the go go
I'm in tears so I'm thankful
Cause I got haters and I got flow
Niggas can't tell me nothin', I got this shit jumpin'
From the White House to The Black Hole
Don't let no lame tell you differently
Bitch I'm the savior of the DMV

Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out
Hold my city down now you see the whole city up

On the brown, I'll probably OD

Time to clock in, baby
Yeah
You ready?
Yes, I was ready last time
We gon' call this ""The Intro About Nothing.""
It's gon' go like this:

[Intro: Wale]
La la
La la, la la

[Chorus: Wale]
Lord, my all, what you think of it? (La la)
Been on this long road accumulating luggage
As time proceeds, preoccupied with everything (La la, la la)
(Start the show) I think it’s ‘bout time that I sing of nothing

[Verse 1: Wale]
Sipping wine, sipping wine, 'cause my Henny finished
Hard to be friendly with women who seen too many niggas
So I keep my circle small, you need reduction
Never too much friends, what is your circumference?
Swear to God, times is hard, but they gettin' better
Tryna enjoy every moment, but see we so competitive
Gabbana made the level, and I never missed a supper
But still my hunger's like a fucking model at a buffet
And with these broads who in love, they ain't seen any better
But dollar signs never mind any Cupid's arrow
And if my heart could speak, it would talk to freaks
And leave the room when a nigga try sleep with 'em
Getting high, getting by, watching time fly
Tell my niggas, I'ma get 'em if they gon' ride
Young, wild nigga living the dream
Although I'm not who I'm destined to be, they keep saying, ""Grow up""
[Chorus: Wale]
Lord, my all, what you think of it?
You been on this long road accumulating luggage
And as time proceeds, preoccupied with everything
I think it’s ‘bout time that we sing of nothing, wassup?
Been on this long road accumulating luggage
And as time proceeds, preoccupied with everything
I think it’s ‘bout time that I sing of nothing, go
Go

[Verse 2: Wale]
I pray my girl don't turn to my baby mother yet
But in fact I do, I need my boo to keep my shit in check
And shit get easier when dreams of chasing respect
Get realized, and ain't no team invading your set
Getting high, getting by as my mind fly
Just bought my homie a Rollie simply to pass time
And on top it's lonely so keep your homies right by your side
And if life is short then we'll be the shorts of the Fab Five
Severed ties with any nigga who covet mine
And all the stunting got me looking ugly in momma's eyes
But I gotta do it, these niggas need provocative music
And as a youth momma worked too much to have an influence
Rapping and music, a bunch of bitches acting too foolish
You gotta be stupid, even Tim Allen had him a tooly
Getting high, sitting down, thinking out loud
It's a shame niggas lame, but I'ma hold it down
Let my bread roll, never let my friends go
That's why I let these dreads grow, I'll never fit your fucking crown
Getting high, getting by, watching time fly
Tell these niggas I'ma get 'em e'ry other time
Young, wild niggas sit in your seat
Know every weekend every liquor for free from Chilli Bowl to Phillippe
Necklace so chilly, bitch, I sow what I reap
Double M Genius, make these bitches so deep
I make these niggas' opinion on younger lyricists consistently weak
Put my cardio in the audio, you missin' the beat
I'm out, standing in every avenue, I'm good in the streets
Outstanding, shitting on niggas, but you sit when you pee, hold up
[Bridge: Choir, Wale]
La la, la la
I figure
La la, la la
They don't care nothing 'bout albums
La la, la la
So why not give 'em an album
La la, la la
About—ha ha
La la, la la (La la, la—hey, hey)
Hey
La la, la la (La la, la—hey, hey)
You better sing that shit, nigga
La la, la la (Hey, hey, hey)
Woo
La la, la la (La la, la—hey, hey)
This how you start the ma'fucking show
La la, la la (La la, la—hey, hey)
My fourth joint in a row
La la, la la (La la, la—hey, hey)
The moon's in the motherfuckin' sky
La la, la la (Hey, hey)
Alright, hey
La la, la la

You expect me to know, a lot of shit that I'm just out here tryna figure out
You expect me to know the answer to some shit that I'm just tryna get up out of
Where did the time, where did the time go?
I'm in the paint, tryna be Rondo
Of course, you got the answers, 'cause you ain't the one that's in my position

[Chorus: 6LACK]
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now
I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now

[Verse 2: Wale]
Look, the winter is here, depression is triplin'
Nobody give a shit, I'm gettin' bread
Industry really be killin' my niggas
Guess entertainment business yin and the yang
Wait, I'm not the same, I can't find no peace
I sacrifice my world to a world that ignore me
Black man in therapy, 'cause white terror don't sleep
I got to roll up my leaf, might stop the PTSD
Carried away, bitches break up with you if you don't break
Niggas is lame, nigga my drive ain't the same
Of course you irate, it's a Wraith
On God, I got some reason to wear my head down (Head down)
Pray all my odds be even 'cause it get hard
And I follow what I feel, but that's the issue (Issue)
My thoughts can be deceivin' if they get a warm welcome

I've been sortin' through a lot of shit that's in my head now
A lot of shit that had me scared now
And don't you leave me here for dead now

And on God, she got some reason to wear her head down (Head down)
Pray all her odds be even 'cause it get hard
And she follow what she feel, and that's the issue (Issue)
My thoughts can be deceivin', my thoughts can be deceivin'

[Verse 3: Wale]
Summer approachin', she look in the mirror, she wish it was winter
Her tummy is pokin'
Lookin' at Instagram, makin' you sick
Yeah, the figure you're fishin' for ain't in the ocean, no
Your potential is more than gold
Expectations is bogus though
Talk about what the eye don't see, this is body dysmorphia
Most of these pseudo-celebrities ain't really beautiful as you could ever be
Talkin', the tannin', and bleachin'
And all the procedures that make you go think that you not a queen
I ain't judgin', just bein' real, if the silicone help your anxiety
If I like you enough I'ma foot the bill
But you do it for you shorty, not for me
That's the cycle that she repeat
All the models she following livin' sweet
But the body she like doesn't come for cheap
She will live under knife, for the infamy
But who am I to judge?
I got my own problems, so I am not the one
When things get dark, I be in my own mind
So even in the crowd I'll be moreso alone

It's like us

My home girl told me I got an issue
With women with issues
I guess I got my own and I can relate to them, you know
The irony in it
When you get what you want, you don't always want it

[Verse 1]
Temptation, I'm done waitin'
I'm done thinking, this ain't enough drinking
I'm in love with a lady who crazy
Maybe it's cause of the way that she praise me
I ain't used to it, she got that hot love
I try to lay low, she like to pop up
I try to make the most of it, beat the box up
I make the pussy wet, I make the heart bust
Good pipe make a girl to a good wife
Good morning wood, I just need a termite
Riding though my hood tryna see where I'm at
She can't be in my face, then she be on my back
Like, ""Where you at Wale?""
Or ""Where is that Wale?"", ""Who you with Wale?""
When I'm back she be like ""You the shit, Wale.""
She crazy, that stalker shit
Every one of her home girls so talkative
No time for that, no acknowledgment
Think it's time you and I need to call it quits
Look, need to call it quits
You be on that stalker shit
Look, I tried to call it quits
Until she came trench coat and a thong and shit
Whoa
[Chorus]
I am like a masochist
So beat me to the bone
I am yours to own, you know
Don't be a pacifist
Cause girl it turns me on
Girl it turns me on
Girl I know you like that, you crazy
But I think I like that, just maybe
I ain't tryna fight back, but baby
If I go inside that, you'll hate me
Baby when I like that, I know it's crazy
Bite me and I bite back, and call it love
And you know I like that, you say you hate me
You bite me and I bite back, and call it love

[Verse 2]
Look
Temptation, starting to sink in
As I indulge in an instinct I'm fadin'
I'm in love with a woman who is crazy
Maybe it's cause of the way that she chase me
The more liquor around, the more I'm in love
The less clothes you got, the less I want to talk
But that throat she got have a nigga stuck
And I be putting it down so she ain't giving up
She call a nigga too much cause she don't get enough
She never ready to go so she forever come
I lick her up, she love it
I know I'm fucking up
I like it cause she a ten, but she say I'm the one
Like ""Settle down, Wale.""
Look, ""Right now, Wale."", ""I'm in love, Wale.""
""Guess I ain't nothing but a quick nut, Wale.""
She crazy, but I attract to it
All the insane bitches so passionate
What they they lack in trust, they make up in lust
And it don't really make sense until the draws is off
She is far bizarre, I be leading her on
I be deep in her rug, said the D is a drug
Shawty feinding for love, I be feeding her lust
I be needing to leave, but I be needing to nut
Never need it enough
[Chorus]
I am like a masochist
So beat me to the bone
I am yours to own, you know
Don't be a pacifist
Cause girl it turns me on
Girl it turns me on
Girl I know you like that, you crazy
But I think I like that, just maybe
I ain't tryna fight back, but baby
If I go inside that, you'll hate me
Baby when I like that, I know it's crazy
Bite me and I bite back, and call it love

In the face of adversity, I prepared a verse to see
Or hear rather...

[Verse 1]
Destined to win, get respect where I live
My reflection contagious, I’m the messenger here
Making love to the streets, they be lusting for bread
They ain’t sleeping until they know every customer fed
When the city was chocolate, there was death in the air
All I’m hearing is AIDS, I ain’t deaf in my ear
Nah … I ain’t deaf in my ear
But he push them whites in the hood like Ray Edmond was there
Shout out to Kirbo, he told me I would make it
Now me, Tony, G, and Tre got the keys to the nation
Pray for peace with the babies, they a beast in the summer
Of course he fiending for trouble, he had a fiend for a mother
Got no leaders among him, got no loyalty either
Once the police get to cuffing, bet his homie deceive him
See, it’s cold where they be at, on that boat like a pirate
Politicians fucking hookers, why you mad at my ganja?
Kick him out of the city, force them whites who can pay up
Still different ablers killing over what isn’t theirs
Lost my nigga over nothing though
Saeed Alisha I miss you, God bless my brother’s soul
[Chorus]
I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

[Verse 2]
Look, I lost my nigga over nothing though
Saeed Alisha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul
Ricky is sitting, Baba was sitting
Caught up and slipping for fearing a McDonald’s position
Seen it over a dollar, got him under a flower
Funeral drama, niggas mystery baby mamas
They ain’t really for condoms, I just think that it’s shocking
Got no fear in no officer, they be scared of them doctors
I’m aware that there’s problems, no Obama gon’ stop it
Where there’s minimal conscience and there’s thousands of choppers
I know Howard that college, but uptown has some problems
I done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise
Little women be mommas, little niggas ain’t fathers
Ain’t nobody here leading, it’s way too easy to follow
They knee deep in today, ain’t too fond of tomorrow
Although weight gets you paper, I pray you're weighing your options
This is soulful my nigga, I’m hoping I am giving a hope to my nigga
We just soldiers, my nigga — don’t know you, my nigga, but know you my nigga
This is soulful my nigga, hope that I am giving some hope to my nigga
We just soldiers, my nigga — don’t know you, my nigga, but know you my nigga
Nigga, know you my...
And you know my nigga
Know you my...
Look...
[Chorus]
I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

[Verse 3]
A king's assassination is why most often fear the hell
So needless to say this, leadership is not with a timid sail
I pray these words live and these gimmicks fail and
I pray whenever I’m seen in my city I forever resemble Braille
May your trees be loud, and your queens be proud
May you see your dreams allowed, before you see them from a cloud
May your glass never reach half-empty, may your enemies find the inner-peace before it ever get to beef
I wish you, wealth, health, and pact-free women for yourself and the shit ain’t the best, hope these lyrics help...my nigga

[Chorus]
I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

[Outro]
See I made it from home, see I made it alone
And all these peasant motherfuckers take shots at the throne
Time after time, again and again
They wanna see a nigga lose but I’m destined to win8Embed"

Is giving them something to talk about
Let, let 'em talk
It makes 'em happy, it makes 'em feel good
They don't believe half the shit they say, people wanna talk
Yeah, it's fun to talk

[Verse 1]
Hate to be the bearer of bad news
But I can't move with too many rap dudes
I respect dudes from my double M crew
But I'm just not that dude hanging on to who's who's and such
Cash rule for some, got room for none
Can't fool with niggas who put the rumors up
Wanted to quit, rap music sucks
But couldn't run a 4.2 so with you I'm stuck
Went in the booth, truth, the only tool I trust
And that's sayin' a lot, 'cause Pro Tools be stuck
You grindin' hot, they wan' be cool with ya
They're like consignment shops, they old news to us, aye

[Verse 2]
Fightin' for my respect, receive it or nothin' else
Preachin' and geekin', I kinda think that I'm Malcolm X
MDMA in my juice, jaws tired and through
Now I'm sweatin' cause the bitches, they perspired me to
Are you judgin' me now? Do you fuck with me now?
Miscarried my first child, ain't finna come out
Fuck the therapy route, where the syrup and loud?
Blue 30 come around, there's the smile
Opiated, could show up later with more elation
All my bitches say, ""Take it easy, enjoy the paper""
Try to be with the people see but I'm fightin' them inner demons
And hiding what’s eating me while I be in Vegas
Yeah, life a gamble anyway, Joe
Pop a Perc, I could merk through the pain though
Mind bills pilin' up, drop a single
Thrill's all gone when that muh'fuckin' fame go
Ever seen a mixed J. Cole and Django?
Educated shit but he whip like he ain't though
Black bitches say my shit is so graceful
White bitches barely know me up in Greystone, damn!

[Intro]
So you're the balloon, you've got that helium, and we travel with you through the string. So we're going up there with you even though we're on the ground. We can't fly, I can't sing, I can't make music, but I can get a-- I can buy it. So I can get a balloon. I can't fly, but I can get a helium balloon

[Verse 1]
I used to put my faith in the yarn, and now communication is gone
I agree we've gone distant, my new location the charts
Naw, mm, can't count the days, but let's just say five
Years, coming of age, it make you blow by your day job
So cry for me, wild for me
It's a horror story, eyes 20/20s that I-M-E your normal C
And I'd be different gettin' diplomas in peace
But gettin' applause and across, I'm hittin' Diplo for a beat
Slight work to Dahi, it's a purpose y'all see
In a world of dopplegangers, niggas ain't worth the copy
You capiche? You got me? Cool!
Niggas'll fly you up this high, won't let you fly to the moon
Goin' up!

[Verse 2]
They love your moves made 'til you make moves
Achievin' new feats every few 8 shoes
16, took a nigga dream different
Had SOBs lookin' like it's new Supreme in it
See that the line's been beastin'
The main attraction, I got 'em hangin' their cleats up
I've been keepin' it G
It's levels to this fellow, hello, I resemble the cheat codes
Some shit good, some shit flop
Some love to see you blow, they don't want see you pop
Shit good, some shit nah
Some shit recycled like second timers in Tour de France
First you picked up, now you picked apart
You get too far 'til your core fans au revoir
They like, ""You stuck with us, cause you let him fly""
Swear this life is like a helium balloon, I'm sorry
But I gotta fly
[Interlude]
Now when a kid gets a helium balloon, he's holding that string and he's keeping this balloon from going anywhere. But he also wants to let it go

[Verse 3]
Gave you a contract, stay true through all that
Came through with Ross, writin' bangers for y'all
But I ain't lose my content, fuck all that nonsense
Diverse with rappin', I'm a writer with passion
Tell the purist that laugh I don't reach out for daps
Cause ""No Hands"" triple platinum
Better writings for retail, why not see my detail?
Gettin' box office spins, only box I fit in is by thigh on a female
So they hatin' me for that, sayin' I just make women songs
It's perfect style, every versatile got me right where her walls at
Still know what my core needs, so fuck who ignores me
'For I need niggas, I'll purchase three mirrors
And show y'all what's for me

[Interlude]
So he wants to let it go and he wants to catch it. Eventually he loses it, he doesn't want to lose it

[Bridge]
Why they give a fuck about the songs I write?
As long as my thugs and my fans them nice
Movin' forward with my life
Crucify me, man of Jesus Christ
Nah do no more favor
Cause 'nough of them are traitor
Them a real back-biter
Them a try take your glory and your energy
Buffalo soldier
Selassie tell them man a gangster
And mi no see no boy me 'fraid of
Them are try take your glory and your energy
[Outro]
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever
Wanna see me good or never see me better?
Fuck 'em, can't say nothin'
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you
Fuck 'em, you ain't sayin' nothin'
Cause the same hand heal you might cut you
Whatever, tell 'em it's whatever
Wanna see me good but never see me better?13Embed"

So it's on me

Now we at the top, MJ, 88

Carolina blue kicks
Hottest nigga on your block
I ain't J.R. Rider but them wolves coming for my spot
From the percentage of youngins winning without no college
I'm in my Laneys but nothing JV about this balling
I lost my deal, got with Will he seen a nigga genius
My rapping skills is on Chapel Hill but you ain't see it
Eyes low, pyro
Grape swisher, my 5's on
My opposition decline slow
My J's straight out of China like baby Cairo
Shout out to Tyga but my squad Balenciaga
One of the rarest in flyest niggas to rep the chocolate
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
Never Michael Jeffrey in 17s, I'm staying with my team
No bullshit loyalty rare
And don't worry 'bout it shawty we here

So it's on me, I got threes for the whole team
Now we at the top,  MJ, '88, and I ain't ever comin' down
Work, so it's on me,  I copped threes for the whole team
Now we at the top, MJ, '88 and I ain't ever comin' down
Work, and the people say, and the people say

[Verse 2]
Groupies everywhere, I'm mentally prepared
I got a black and red joint, I bet they thinking bred
They tryna see me fail, just know my thinking and my sneakers rare
Get that Chi-Town love, I'm in Leaders gear
Bet they got they pom-poms up soon as I see O'Hare Seven
I make a damn movie fooly
I been the dookie, these rappers is Sam Bowie to me
I was a Bowie student, it wasn't really nothing
That's why I kicked it and blew grass like Boise punter
This is no Space Jam, I'm out the globe stunting
I'm a one-man band, I prolly Jordan 1 em
And all my singles golden
I will not forfeit, this my defining moment you know
7-Eleven, yea I got 'em open
11 pair of 7s, they touching my rap touring
It was all a dream, it was all a dream
And when I'm 45, do it like I'm 23
And premature, tell me I'm wrong if a nigga swing I feel it jack
I was just waiting 'til the sixth ring
[Chorus]
So it's on me, I got threes for the whole team
Now we at the top,  MJ, '88, and I ain't ever comin' down

So I let my friends carry paraphernalia

Picture a young, rich woman taking me serious
Although I hit my stride, ain't even in prime (nah)

She settle for this bread so therein should be a trophy
I'ma prolly marry somebody already familiar
VH1 10 and I'm not thinkin' about these bitches
Can do without opinions
Another brother caught up in the business
Had that lock since I lost my scholarship
I been gettin' it to my old coach and ballin'
Rose gold was forty, dopest nigga recordin'
Make hoes sprint the 40
See me I thought money would change it, it got worse
But it's a lot better than screamin' ""who got work?"" (who got work?)
From opening up for Back to packing out 9:30
I never sold crack when crack rappin' was workin'

Big black diamond, bigger than a black razor
Asian, Black, Caucasian, or Blasian
Persuasion, so amazing, it's amazing
How they stand there, cuffed up, patient
Waiting 'til the perfect time for conversation
My observation tell me that she's Gucci baby, baby (Mwah!)

And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210

[Verse 1]
Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go
Part-time waitress, she really want to make it
In the ""City of Lights"", it's hard to see clear
She don't really care about anyone advice
And nothing here's real, and everyone's alike
Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light
Indulging a meal when a toilet's insight
Expose those fries, can't hold those down
To read for Seven Pounds, you must release several pounds
This is Heaven on Hell
This is how she want to live
But she ain't really tripping, she's on Beverly Hills

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
[Verse 2]
Just another day out in Beverly Hills
She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still
Believing the screens or anything there
But reality shows ain't real
So pretentious with no potential
She goes to catch up, although her rent's up
In her defense she a part of the crowd
She going to borrow some money
So she can party at Chows
It's apart of her goal
It's all she knows
Graduated from Rosé, addicted to blow
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow
So she kisses the stars
And she gives them a blow
After every show, a dream she hold
Inhibitions is gone, she just want to be known
She want to be know, she just want to be known
Pulling down her skirt
""I never done this before""
Nah

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
[Verse 3]
You know big-breast girls
Never ever pay rent
They meet them rich boys
Throw D's on that bitch
Lease on the whip
Beach on the weekend
Hotel suite, room keys is a gift
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger
Now you just a whore to the known entertainers
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick
The sun's always out
But it's clouds over here
Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims
Hold on you can see my vision
Next time you look down on a nigga

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything

Niggas Shyne like a synagogue: think about it
Centerfold bitches prolly couldn't get a drink up out me
They say I need some guidance
But I think they need a stylist
Bitch you should see my wallet
This bitch gonna need Pilates
And you can't see Folarin
What the fuck are you, retarded?
I ain't hugging the corner, but I hustle so enormous
A modern day Goodfella, I'm Ray Liotta
Loud smoking so pass the L like a semicolon
The Bentley is rented but I got many chauffers
Foamposites if you ain't got em then you penny-loafing!
Underrated that's temporarily for the moment
Only marry your woman if mama cold as Willona
See, I'm second to no one
I'm the messenger-poet
They slowly showin' they colors
They music good but they bogus

Bored of the shooters
My women be in the newest
Yo bitches should buy a loofah
Where I'm from they is ruthless
Babies turn into shooters
Crazy talking and foolish
You catch a shell like a Koopa
And I don't give a fuck, see my bitches is kama sutra
One of them bitches is cute, the rest of them congruent
Why you talking my nigga? Just go and do it
Niggas awful at dressing, they just a'ight at music
I'm trend-setting, despite of an awful debut
Still got me another deal big as any nigga in music
The remedy is get your hustle on
Fuck a broad unless you love a broad
Well in that case, brother, then love her hard
Put my trust in my dog
Put my trust in my God

[Verse 1]
Ayo I’m goin' places, Dior Homme lacin' all occasions
And Lord gave me amazing thinking and short patience
Lay solo, forever flashy though I hate photos
Date four hoes, make her smile and make her moan though
Lady charmer, put armor by your baby mama
I hate to say it a later moment I didn’t warn ya
High roller, big spender
And my intentions to keep her on the sack, you just Saks Fifth her
I’m that different, this cat can react mad pimpish
I gathered a couple hundred thousand, I can’t remember
They keep talkin' and we keep winning
Why niggas never say capisce until police chalk em
Because of my bitch that's talkin', givin' her head, the streets will follow
I come from a place where niggas my age ain't placed to see tomorrow
To each his own but each of them is known to steal or rob you
But jails are overpopulated but know there's seats in college
And those are the least of problems, I speak to God he says I'm alright
My vision funny, though 20/20's my hindsight
Bad bitches with me, real niggas with me
Whole ghetto with me mixin Ketel with the Simply
Like the sweet anguish, find your peace baby
I know the millions you get come with a billion haters, yea
[Chorus]
Forgive me, I’m a rider
Sure I’m just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd
You know that I’m a rider
Tell 'em just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd

[Verse 2]
I’m pickin' apart, my wicked opponents
Get in my zone
Niggas can't join us, so, these niggas done cloned us
Look at me close, see the results you see a nigga a loner
Cause all of the bitches that's giving me grief also be given me boners
Blow up in rap, young and you black
Niggas be blowin' your phone up
Whenever you don’t, lose you a homie, ho
Adult from show cuz
If you get that, then roll up
If you get that, that’s no love
Every move you make they got lip
Every chick you like done got kids
And forget that chick had brought friends
Every jay you hit you need vent
Every friend you got, got M.O's
I’m in a game, even with a deep bench
I'mma ball like small fro Kobe
Without the 8, but all the hate though
Pockets thicker all my niggas, ain't the same though
I just came up, fuck is you sayin' though
Gave the business my heart, it just gave me the finger
Nigga, yeah

Forgive me, I’m a rider
Sure I’m just a simple man

""This nigga got a motherfucking statue?""
""Who?""
""This nigga Wale""
""Wale? What the fuck he ever done to get a statue?""
""Who the fuck this nigga think he is?""
""Hey spray that shit, spray that shit""
""Tag that shit""
""Hurry up, hurry up""
""Yeah, fuck a Wale, fuck outta here""
""Fuck outta here, man""
""Wild-ass nigga""

[Verse 1]
Life's better when your niggas good, and your mama straight
Though honestly still looking for some type of balance
Cause the status got me Jah tripping
Cause I like my bitch, but I love these bitches on my dick
When spitting tell me what you feeling different knowing you's the bread winner
And it's rare you hear niggas say he can't feel you
But in your ears like he dope, just not dope enough
And your closest homie probing you to open up
And to do so you must roll one up
And it’s lonely at the top, they tell me that they feelin' me
I eat this game and shit this out
My dirty drawers got winning streaks
I’m in too deep this industry, insane to a nigga
Got change like them niggas, but ain’t change like them nigga
They only fuck with my old shit cause I’m on shit
But I was potent in ’06, niggas slow as shit
Now my dreams is nothing more than minimal thoughts
And my cheese gonna fluctuate, though, sleep is the cause
And I’m tired though, and I’m high too
But it’s like my music made these niggas turn they pride to food
Yea, ye ain't even gotta love us
But you better respect this motherfucking hustle, real nigga shit
[Chorus]
Satisfaction's for suckers
Satisfaction's for suckers
And you don't even gotta love us
But you will respect this motherfuckin' hustle, real nigga shit

[Verse 2]
See life better when you know you real
I know some niggas is winning but ain’t been home in years
Pray they not know the feeling, sitting on a couple million
Sipping pretentious liquids
Usually think money would heal it, funny, it's only trippin'
If you were afloat, I bet you soak if you with 60 niggas
So we keep that circle small and never let no squares near it
It’s double-M G, I hope they know the set
Don’t you cop a second whip unless yo mama out of debt
Shout out to my cousin Bola, be home in a minute yep
My nigga’s at the Rivers correctional, that’s me in that vent
They thought I wouldn’t win in a crew full of trappers
But I do, I fucked the game and came out a gold rapper
I should be loving my accomplishments
But a brand new Maserati got me plottin' on another hit
Success is like a never-ending battle
Wit' whoever at the top and if that’s you-you who you tryna hit
To top all my last shit, it’s all that I ask of
I pray you forgive me if I don’t bask in this chapter
I’m a legend out Georgetown, we talkin' bout practice?
Cuz in this establishment you ain’t never established
[Chorus]
Satisfaction's for suckers
Satisfaction's for suckers
And you don't even gotta love us
But you will respect this motherfuckin' hustle, real nigga shit
Satisfaction's for suckers
Satisfaction's for suckers
And you don't even gotta love us
But you will respect this motherfuckin' hustle, real nigga shit

Let me mine you until your vagina is wet enough and fill your mind with pleasant thoughts
Champaign by your tub, rose petals as she walk, you know the floor don't need to see you
I got that good stroke, come be my Mona Lisa
You see, them other guys pay their mind to your physical features
And I can admire your body but your mind is much deeper
And I found me a keeper, and I found me a winner, and I found me a queen
What we eatin' for dinner? You know I cook it and clean it and do whatever for you
Black mother of the earth you know I forever owe you
I would never ignore you ‘cause I'm forever loyal
Let's fall in love, let me put my seed in your soil
See it'd be an honor to create life with you; can I lay right with you? And wake you up with light kisses?
Good mornin' sunshine, see the more I see your eyes is the more that I admire you
Whenever you tired I be right there beside, the pillow talk and confide, make your secrets all mine
May I sleep between your thighs and wake up deeply in your heart?
And you're mindful forever and repeat when we get up
I ain't even gonna front girl I think you is the one, so let's fall asleep with the moon and I will greet you with the sun

This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now the one thing you've got to be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person 5 seconds after it's over. I mean something happens to their personality, it's really quite astounding

[Verse 1: Wale]
That scary love, never get married love
I got that fuck you or make you love me temporary love
I just pick and roll these hoes; I don't even know these hoes
I cut ‘em first, cut ‘em deep I fuckin' Sheryl Crow these hoes, ha
Hey that pussy like some water hose and I'mma need to cum first, yeah her turn be optional
Modify your posture ho, mother fuck a cas, no?'
You can't see mi casa, we gon' rock at this Econo Lodge, haha
You know I’m stickin' to that proper code: strapped up, lock n load
Go stiff the condom broke, ain't no baby father ho, fuck that baby father shit
I don't respect no brain unless we talkin' that saliva spit
Ho I got a lot of bread, lot of whips, lot of chicks
You can be demolished then be gone without acknowledgement
This just how it got to be, this is how I got to live
I don't care about your drive unless you talkin' ridin' dick
You is just a groupie bitch and groupie bitch, no I am sick
I am sick of women treatin' niggas like that lotto ticket
Yeah my shit ain't no scratch and win

Tryna stay up out the light
Up out the spotlight
The club
And all that kinda stuff man
Tryna hide, tryna ignore
But its all fake
Understand what I’m sayin?
This life...
This game...
There ain’t no lovin it it don’t love you back
I feel your hate… I do man
But see man
A nigga like me man
I love the game
I love the hustle
Be feelin like one of them ball playin niggas you know
Like Bird, Magic or somethin
Yeah you know a nigga got dough, a nigga could lead the league
But if I leave…
The fans still gon love me man?

[Verse 1]
I need your admiration for infinity
Not that this ain't lucrative, but I just need your energy
I got the passion to please, I will not gasp or fatigue
And the way I'm ballin, gimme a Grammy or Danny O'B
Standing OV, let these bitches follow me
And I just give them D, give them D like they is out the league
Hasheem Thabeet and various other peoples
The pressures of greatness always comes with critiquing
Newest of sneakers, you consuming the bleachers
Blewin' some reefer in my zone like a 2-3 defense
Double-M G up, we up, y'all just relax
See uh, all my females show bust, Curtis Enis
Nittany Lion, my Penn State it, niggas recite it
I'm Michael Jordan major, you niggas Harold Miner
Pussy be all on me, we too young for romancin'
My niggas never block, I think I'm Barry Sanders
[Verse 2]
Vic Page never made it, Len Bias never made it
See God gave us the talent, but the devil make us famous
My effort is contagious, so check this BOA shit
With this recording I'm as sick as Jordan before Game 6
Jazz talkin, I bet I pick and roll with your bitch
You got some paper for me? Hit me on the Hornacek
Walter Payton Mercedez, sweetness in every ride
Hold on my pupils slowing, I don't got no lazy eye
Kicking flows, pockets about as thick as strippers on poles
Zone blocking with these bitches, I'm just picking a hole
Pardon that jargon but since I'm balling they getting salty
They all catching feelings, I should Biletnikoff 'em
Them niggas talking, they like man he official
Man, you Olowokandi I'm just being Pacific
I'm just bein' prolific, right now don't need no Mrs
I got a rack of Trojans, no ring, my Lane Kiffin
I'm tryin' pimp em I'm trying to be that cool
All them bitches Converse with me off that React Juice
Now Jordan III my shoe, Double M G my crew
When you do it big as Manute you make it seem minute
Ricky Moore Flightposite, Mike Bibby blue Foams
Interscope feeling like Charlotte when they traded Kobe you know?
But I let it go, Rozay finna re-up
He got himself a Kobe and they stuck with Vlade Divac
And we no la de de da I don't care for any people

If you read that? Oh

Let’s get it

[Verse 1: Wale]
What if they told you this music was bogus?
The government-run it, they controllin' the culture
Would you believe that? Hah
If you read that? Haha, yeah
What if they told you the iPhone was tapped?
They see all of your browsin' and know you via your apps
And Twitter and Instagram is really like middlemen
And internet soldiers, everybody was carrying Macs
What if they said Obama wasn't a red
He actually got a good ass tan
And the swag to appear black, hah
Would you believe that? Niggas impeach that, look
How 'bout they tell you you dyin' if you ain’t voting?
So now your go put one in, relying off that emotion
And believe that, haha
You know you do with your weak ass, hah, hah
What if they make a list, telling you what is dope?
Telling you what’s hip but never let they mother jump
Part in the flow with consistence control they many souls
Although it’s niggas, it’s loaded by television shows
Opinions show but most to us they null and void
A little gossip make little people feel more important
Some don't believe, somehow they need it for the allure
A lot of bull is a pot of gold to the gullible, yeah

I turn down the radio
Just to turn the tv on (on, on)

And then the internet slit the television throat

[Verse 2: Wale]
And then the WorldStar model fell up out the orbit
And for that broad, a rapper now is behind his mortgage
And other rappers would visit shawty, shawty keep goin'
And everybody be laughin' at him, he doesn’t know it
‘Cause he believed her
Thought he couldn’t be G'd by such a sweet girl
News flash, news flash, it’s a cruel world
No one is too thorough to lose it all to a girl, uh
What if they told you your chick was a groupie?
You know, like a ho, the type that be choosing
You gon' play it like nah homie, soon as the car pull up
Tell her you’ll holler at her, say get in and goin' lose it, uh

TV killed the radio, ah

And then the internet slit the television throat

When I moved forward, I gave birth to several episodes

We just believe they gon' repeat what we just told
And all that bull is a pot of gold to the gullible

Got fiends jumpin from the free throw line, like Michael Jordan
And why you think I got all of these J's on my feet?

Blowin' bomb haze, I just tell CJ keep on rollin'

All black everything, this shit like a HBCU

I make my old bitches buy me all the latest shoes
One whip just ain't enough, I just seen thirty-three
You only half a W without a second V
Gotta be dreamin', bitch I gotta be chosen
Shawty when I was 20, I had a Camry and tokens
But now I'm okay, bitch I got my shit together
Rozay told me, ""Keep on working shawty, you’ll be rich forever""
Ever, forever my endeavors
And I sever my opponents, bitch I'm cold like it's in Denver
The dilemma is, you think I got no conscience
You think I'm just here flossing on raw shit about car shit

Work straight out the kitchen, ain't no competition
You just shut up and listen and you can complete the mission
Know you want me to fall, I don’t do nothing but ball
You heard I was in jail, well I just came from the mall
I’m on my way to the jeweler, 'bout to cop me a Muller

On my way to Bootsy Bellows with hella the hoes
Try and think what I'ma tell 'em when they get alone
I'm a glutton for women I shouldn't yearn for
Shouldn't be tempted, but baby, I like to hurt, or
Maybe 'cause I was searchin', I found me the perfect person
But me and her didn't work out, she buried what she worked for
And I carried the bitterness of a kola nut
Nigerian shit, my parents never showed much
Womanizer, probably could've been a feminist
'Cause I respect 'em, but Lord, I got polygamy problems
The hoodie come from Barneys, spendin' money is therapeutic
To wear the shit they don't think that you care to buy
So we buying Prada, Balenciaga like it is nada
In the Ferrari, my fear is God and tax problems
Pyer Moss, I dropped ten on my last visit
And half that up at Saks, I favor black businesses

Sue me, l'm rootin' for everybody that black, yeah, uh huh, yeah
Sue me, I'm rootin' for everybody that black, yo, yo yo, look, look
Sue me, I'm rootin' for everybody that black
Spent 'bout two racks on handmade durags
Sue me, I'm rootin' for everybody that black
That's everybody from sports to college class to rap, I'm back

Hold up, yo, look
People, people, the high life is a movie, we ain't promised a sequel
Ambition, my second album, how was you sleepin'?
Dropped the album with Seinfeld, they thought I was tweakin'
A prophet, a genius
I'm flyin' with Lena, I'm ridin' with Nina
One write for the Chi, one right where I need her
The funny thing is I'll always be single
I love me some Logan, I love me some Issa
I'll never get either
Those women are queens, me? I'm a drunk, I'm a demon
Heaven knows I'm a dreamer
I seen Taraji and Kelvin, always hope I could be that
I fell in love with an actress actin' like she don't need me
Polarizin' the sun, underrated again
Show business will never love you the way you love it
You come and we go, they quick to forget
So every bourgeois event I attend, I tell 'em this

Still ya show no respect kid, the Good Book said praise
But you so stuck in your ways, you got my image appraised
While you sinning, I wait
Fornicating with women, I sat right there on your table
Don't bow your head for grace, though I'm keeping you graceful
Brothers was born to cheat, though I question who faithful
Fast for me, nope, blasphemy though
Rap to it so racks up to match up with me froze
How can a diamond supercede my wisdom
I seen a reverend with five of me as he read his scripture
This is bible readings to people with malice intentions
You silly get wits seen a Ahki with a crucifix pendant
With a Cuban attached on a secular scene?
I died for you all, now niggas die over me
[Hook]
Jesus piece Jesus piece Jesus piece
But don't nobody want know Jesus' peace
Jesus piece Jesus piece Jesus piece
But don't nobody want know Jesus' peace

[Verse 2]
Sierra Leone diamonds, LA to New York got em'
If nobody stores have me some probably would know about me
All over paparazzi, shout out to Murakami
See they commercialize me, I'm sure there will be more robberies
Work, new chain swag get you crew laid fast
Or laid down or not a ticket next to dad
And the bible told you wait on my arrival
But patience was your problem
So get Jacob to come find me
And religion is a style, if not then why this shit a quarter mil
No fugazi, see Jacob tell you that -ish real
Hallelujah the things you do to be the manure
You never thank me at shows but you keep me on tour
Sunday services pastor is the wealthy ones working it
Preaching Armageddon while collection plates been circling the room
Fears but a tool
And Gospel gone commercial pray the purpose isn't cruel
And the workers in the pulpit want they blessings to improve
And they stone me on the cross and niggas stone me for the ooh's
And the ahh's foolish, what am I who are ya
I'm coming down from the sky cause niggas keep praying to shine
Look... amen
[Outro]
For the price of fame
What would you do to have em' say your name
See I promise I would never cop another chain
But the Alms spent on these VS's
Got me in that complex page
For the price of fame
When that Bugatti drop my accountant stop me for a second
And said ""not today, not today""
For the price of fame

For the price of fame
What would you do to have em' say your name
It is such a shame8Embed"

Revolution might be televised
But make sure if they do see, them people see my good side
Black nigga with intellect, 6th grade, I was Special Ed
10th grade, eyes red as shit, lookin' like a nigga just left Japan
Well goddamn, now I be the man
And every bitch kickin it with me goin Mia Hamm
Every visit to Neimans, I swear I don't even see a tag
When you're reachin' your dreams, you got reason to brag
Ambition over everything
And I never plan on settling
And my wish is to have everything
And my only fear's a wedding ring
Hopin' that my niggas see, hopin' that these bitches saw it
Hopin' when this bread get here, I got the same addiction for it
Niggas think I'm slippin, niggas is lunchin'
Either dumb or smokin' dippers or something

[Chorus]
No days off, no days off
Heard they coming for a nigga, bitch, I'm Ray Charles
No days off
Takin' breaks will leave you broken and we can't fall
No days off, no days off
Heard they coming for a nigga, bitch, I'm Ray Charles
No days off
Takin' breaks will leave you broken and we can't fall
[Verse 2]
I used to sleep hungry in a bed next to roaches
Now I wake up, play a beat and burn a couple roaches
Permanently focused, learning while I'm going
And the word that most important, hoe regurgitate my sperm'll
Let me work that, know I'm nasty but I'm actually quite respectful
But you call a bitch a bitch and real bitches don't respect you
And that's fucked up, but I guess that shit's just tough love
Around my way, I'm cutthroat, and what I done just ain't enough
Fly shit ain't no thang to us, 20 somethin', no baby ma
Ma want me to go find a wife, I'm like, ""Sorry ma, this not the time""
Can't decide, take em out, G'd up, shake it down
Weed up, better make a sound, greened up, I'm like De La Salle
Higher than high school
Mariah tunes and five flutes or 5'2"" hoopers in light shoes
Never liked school, reckless when I move
Where I from, it get cold, niggas die over shoes
Niggas shoot over bitches, bitches get niggas set up
Stuck up, beat up and wet up, that's why I never met em
That's why forever I love seldom and trust never
And fuck whoever don't put one hundred percent in
Nigga

[Chorus]
No days off, no days off
Heard they coming for a nigga, bitch, I'm Ray Charles
No days off

The streets is cold and the beaches is warm
The bitches is everything in between

[Verse 1]
Who would believe this rap shit would have me well off
Type of life a nigga kill or go to jail for
Yeah, can't wait 'til the wheels down
And I'm amazed you clown niggas is still around
Smoking haze all over town like it's allowed
I like my women soft-spoken but the weed loud
Catchin' Heat, floor seats and we all fresh
From court seats to court seats is progress, of course
Tell them other niggas ""man up""
Tell LeBron drop fifty unless he playin' us
KOD a couple fifties like a precinct
Straight cognac got a nigga feeling seasick, oh shit
Chef Creole, two-seater
And my watch lookin' like it's all 3PO
2 V's in the street, blowing trees with hoes
And more weed for me, shout out to Meek P.O

[Hook]
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Little more weed, first class seats
First class hoes, we on South Beach
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
[Verse 2]
We at Mansion, but no cape on
And that ass looking right, what you pay for it
Look, I know you not gay or nothing
But we should find another girl with a tapeworm
I'm in a rental on Collins
Me and my compadres, burning up Barneys
With a model and some limited BVLGARI
My name hold weight and you don't really keep the bar raised
Where dark niggas with dark thoughts and long braids
Is not far from white girls with big bread
And light beers, they slight care, they spring breaking
But right there, they still scheming, they not eating
Knowing they needy as a bitch, they don't need a reason
And when you up in Wet Willies, you ain't even thinking

[Hook]
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Little more weed, first class seats
First class hoes, we on South Beach

If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon

[Verse 3]
Ok, black Panamera, dash on a million
It ain't nothin' better than a passionate woman
She graduated top of the class
Carol City or was it the west
Hold up I dont remember really, hold up
Two whips, six tattoos, no kids
And I heard you come alive, when you go to LIV
I ain't trying to be ignorant
But I'm leaving town in a little bit
Miami nights, ain't another one
Until the buzz go away lets have a little fun
Paradise, get away
Thinkin' why it's not South Beach everyday

We got the jet waitin' on us at the airport homie
We got money to go get baby
Let's get it

Does a kid, need a goal, if the powder's, made of gold?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Getting blowed
Thinkin I'm so glad that I can rap cause I couldn't move no dope
But I do know, a few niggas that did, and a few niggas that still
And the few niggas that's through, are the few niggas that's dead
So fuck a 9 to 5, they clockin' and tryna survive
Cop a brick and supply cause nobody offering jobs
Bricks build buildings, build houses, build neighborhoods
But a brick done turned a nigga to a baller or a dated shirt
Understated to say it hurts, I was optimistic
'Til I seen my youngin' whippin', made me wish that I was flippin'
Fuck this college when niggas out here just dollar pitchin'
Cause after 4 or 5, you don't got nothing but college tickets
Bricks

[Hook: Lyfe Jennings & Wale]
Been a minute tryna hold my head and work this out
Tryna work this out
Counting numbers up in my head tryna build this house
Tryna build this house
Mama told me if I make my bed then I gotta lay down
Tryna build this house
But I never seem to keep these words all up out my mouth
It's only one way out

But I do know, a few niggas that did, and a few niggas that still
And the few niggas that's through, are the few niggas that's dead
Look, little niggas'll shoot you, they got nothing to say
Cause local celebrities only bout a brick away
Niggas used to whip em he getting those from whippin yay
And you got no paper, you been so patient, come get some weight
Sneaker boxes, you can see your progress
And you weekend shopping, show people your people poppin
I can see the problem, you nigga don't lack no conscience
Can't shoot, can't dribble, can't rap, young nigga don’t got no options
From a brick, to a stone, turned a fiend, from a homie
When the powder, turn to power, and the power, turn to dough
Turning head, with yo whip, is it worth, what you did?
If a brick, is a brick, through a brick, you can build
From a brick to a stone, make a fiend for a homie
Turn a cheek on a foe, turn a reef to a home
Turn the powder, into power, and the power, turn to hoes
If a brick is a brick, through a brick you can grow

9 years old, Feds looking for my moms

First time I heard bricks, I was thinking construction
Until my 'migo plug from Mexicó gave me my introduction
Now 16, getting them bricks for the 16
Was unwrapping bricks but now I'm rappin' bricks for 16
I was 17 ridin' in that Lexus on 20's
18 and 19 payin' nothing over 20
And a thousand 8 grams divided by 4 is 252
If you know what that mean, you noticed it now
And if you don't, learn how to divide nigga

I’m talking work, no punch clock!

Me and my haters is literally Siamese
I can define me but if I let my friends do it
They'd tell you I'm some bipolar, hard drug user
The J gets smaller, I'm loving my zone
Though surrounded by an entourage, I feel like I'm alone
A long way from normal, I try to keep it cordial
I made some new friends, meet recorder and touring
Shout out to my nigga, it's now for a nigga
Know some niggas back home ain't proud of a nigga
They don't see my vision, grown man mission
They all see my life from a childish position
I'm the mouth of the District, nobody work harder
My heart is in the monuments, saliva's is in the harbor
So tell me all my followers, am I wrong for barking?
Am I wrong for thinking I was better off in college?
At least I'd be stable, yeah, slightly less popular
But wouldn't be the topic of my few friends talking
A few niggas talk but they do without knowledge
I do self evaluate, yeah, I know I've got some problems
Can't change who I am, I just try to get better
So in the mean time, keep it moving or accept that
And you all will respect that

You always say you wasn't ready for no man
But I wasn't having that, I gave you everything I had

And I bet you all them letters in your mailbox waiting
And I ain't never plan to be famous
So I'm a take that rubber off, I wouldn't mind having babies
With a home girl, best friend, lover, all that
Ex-boyfriend was wack, she had enough of all that
Look me in my eyes, say if you take it I'm a give it
And if I give it to you, don't you treat me like them bitches
Please Wale, she used to call me 'Le
One day she called me early, to tell me that she late
Fuck you mean?
See my hands start to shake
I ain't looking in her eyes but her face
Cause tears falling down make me ache
We should just ignore it, you know we can't afford it
She said I cannot believe that you say we should abort it
I will not support it, what happened to you courting?
And I ain't want no nigga from the jump, you ignored it
You just had to force it, you had to keep going
Now that little pre cum gone be having me swollen
As we go forward, I came back from touring

K Diddy, I'ma sound like money
Shawty put the ""ill"" in silhouette
Hahaha, uh, or the wet
Hahahaha, I play too much

[Verse 1: Wale]
I be lusting for women who resemble perfections
Sending 10 A.M. texts like um, ""Hello good looking""
Hypothetical question, how do you get all your essence in them
Getups and dresses? Oh, fuck it, I just be tripping, uh-uh
I love the newness of it, we closer by the moment
None of us used to nothing so my old jokes working perfect
Imagination, focus and hope I know you controlling
Holding your every word and you quoting my older verses
Both of our ex's issues with both of us now seem perfect
Hoping our imperfections aren't noticed or unimportant
We all just rush the feeling, nobody loves the searching
Of course we meet our intentions before we meet the person

[Pre-Hook: Chance the Rapper]
But whenever you got lonely, needed some advice (Igh!)
You'd call me your brother, that word is cold as ice

I be fishing in smaller ponds for, girls I knew 'fore the concert
Conquer the friendzone first then, beat through the bush I wonder
(Igh!) If the grass is green or, wilted and deadish yellow
I seen them put up lights but, Christmas was red and yellow
Ham, no burger, they fish for compliments (Igh!)

This isn't no gripe but a mere portion of a semi-important life
Far from a complaint, but a mere look at the present showing you the changes that I made
The proverbial lemonade that I made
I made my mistakes, you see life's lemons often times come in a abundance
In conjunction with the pressure that we're under
Underrated some would say
Hated, and some say it's the things I say or how I say em
And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words
It's like I'm an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard
I guess I gotta wait, deprived by the station's eye
Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves
Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind
In this state of mind that I'm in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that y'all give
And they hypebeasts, street wear, Versace and Vuitton that I'm in
And really don't matter unless y'all coming with
No days off, may we rip the face of the whole game off
Imma say it to y'all, I'm gonna put my faith in y'all when I don't understand me
They say I'm running hip-hop but I'd rather unify with y'all then stampede
And lastly for everybody who doubted I can't live without you, please
Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness y'all
Paint A Picture to A.D. to freestyles to famous songs we out 'chere (here)
Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic
Let's get it, I go hard, no days off

[Verse 1: Part 1]
Pain on my face, laying back rolling a J
Feeling like these rap niggas ain't as real as they say
That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested
Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch
Ain't nothing stopping us, tell u what the problem is
I'm on top of my game but these niggas won't acknowledge it
So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus
So, to stop us better take it in blood like a phlebotomist
[Seinfeld Skit]
You really need some help
But a regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you, you know what I mean?
You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied
And have all those people looking at you and checking up on you
That's the kind of help you need, not the once-a-week for eighty bucks, no
You need a team, a team of psychiatrists working around the clock
You need to go to, like, Vienna or something

[Verse 1: Part 1]

[Verse 1: Part 2]
I walk around understanding the politics
Wish you niggas father understood where the condom was
'06 came, had all kind of buzz
And Isaiah say one day your time will come
Then '09 came, them bad record sales
The silver-lining couldn't find 'em up on any shelf
I'm in the mirror like ""this a product of my skills?""
And I feared that my fans say I failed
It's just my fate, let me chill, nah flip
My shit was submarine like, under ship
Look at what I'm up against, scrutiny, criticism
Everybody judging off a single I ain't even pick
Now my eyes Chinese, keep the loud lit
Now I'm taking these pills and I ain't even sick
Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention
I wanted them on my debut, but they ain't wanna listen
You know I love my team, but they couldn't see my vision
Interscope is my fam, so I ain't tryna make no issue
I'm just trying to paint that picture, when I'm rhyming up in this booth
I'ma try to rhyme and get through, I'm documenting the truth
Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won't forsaken
The only album flop is the album niggas hate so
A.D. 2, on the way, let's do this
And God willin' niggas gonna triple up them units
Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin'
If no one's there to listen guess I'll put it in the music
Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin'
I'm heading to Vienna since y'all niggas ain't doin' shit!5Embed"

Don't say on the beat what you won't say in the streets
Cause face to face niggas never said it to me
I came here to eat every way to the bone
Never put mama on hold up whenever she call
I follow the law, shine bright illuminated
Got niggas in black hoodies homicide celebrated
Folarin on raw, you other nerds stepped on
In my German couture, the Nation of Islam
Forgive me, I'm flawed, the dollar signs is all I saw
I knew once I got a Beamer, the bitches would come aboard
I pray to the Lord as I'm holding on the sword
And off with your niggas' heads if you come between me and tomorrow
Nike, and I upgraded the Ree's
Real checks is all a nigga sees
So watch where you step and love what you rep
And realize that today is just another test
Say bye to the boy

And I'm feeling like the world's at my neck
When your revenue's sufficient you just work for respect
Every verse, every breath, your dollar woes is adios
Minus the arrogance, my these coons' is maricons
Not even close to touching us, what the fuck is up?
Heroes turn to cluckers and sellers turn into customers
All my money coming in plural far as the women love
All my bunnies outta this world like Captain Bucky O
Hair to the small of her back
Probably just wanted a nigga stacks
And tell me that it ain't cause of rap
And I got plans of me calling her back
The ones who never hear back
My type of ho like an error syntax
And I brought Virginia, the District, as well as Maryland back
But I must have done it all with Rey Mysterio's hat
I put my soul in the culture, but what is it giving me back?
Has your niggas mind erased, don't let your memory lapse, boy

Upper echelon spitting, what the fuck is up?
I'm hospitable, blowing on that medical
And I wish that Channel 2 would give a nigga better news
But everybody hanging with us rarely ever knew us
Forever rude hoes, I don't ever need
Can't stimulate me mentally, then we should never be
However we can meet, it's something from you I need
It's something about women I don't need
I'll forever fiend for, even if a nigga team's full
They riding with the styles and that's word to Teen Wolf
You know the team'll do it, cause the team is raw
Don't know your lady's cleaners, but I'm in her jeans as much
Beg for her feature, then angry with me when I be busy
Before I hit it they was telling me ""wire over sixty""
Racks for a rap, racks for a rap
Now I see the same niggas, charge 'em for a dap

Yea, so where your keys at, Playboy?
I sling hyperboles at a warped speed
Usain Bolt runnin' from ready, set, bang, go!
Third album of fate, nothing to bank on
I paint for 'em, they lay em on it, I paint more
They ain't showing the same love, try to think through it
I must influence some better music, let the hate show up
When 'Le show up, we make noise, that that they can't ignore
This cold poet just throw up quotables to give 'em hope
Go and slow up haters train of thoughts with brainstorms
We all niggas with dreams whether music or ball
Whether hooping, a song or simply pursuing em all
Since Paint a Picture, I been on a mission
Coming from the district everything but monumental
I ain’t gotta mention all the little flaws
Where the stairs it’s the boys, find it hard to follow politicians
And they Marion Barry, yea I have Barry Sanders
Never wanna be gangster, put them dirty pads up
The man route, try and get my parents out
Fuck a stash spot, I was mastering the slant route

Taking my route

And I wrote this album without a care in the world
But the outcome as long as it’s an outpour of niggas who
Came out they downfall like an overblown round ball before my sound off
Or maybe this music will inspire a future mountain mover or two
And if I ever rush more music out to you
Then know that I’m overworking myself ‘cause my heart and mind into it
Ain’t been a black hero since Robert Townsend

And I call you Ms. Folarin see that got a ring, don’t it
And I got this thing for ya my affinity’s infinity
Put that on everything these other bitches anything
Shit
I’m just tryna chill a bit play with it and blaze a bit
Then play you all my latest shit
Lately I been stressing so I need you like I’m crazy
Music's irrelevant and money’s overrated
That’s why I spend it like I look at it with hatred
To look at you is painful, cuz I ain’t seen you naked
But I’ma wait it out I’m bout to see that drought
Cuz if I hit it now these feelings take a different route
So, I’m on some 40 days and night shit
Feeling like it’s Ramadan and I just need a bite quick
Tryna get inside your mind without that night shift
So I’ma be aight for the night with a goodbye kiss

Girl I don’t want to rush tonight
Take your time when you’re with me baby
So I can give you what you need, I know what you like

But I just wanna make love to your mind
So if you open up your heart I’ll give you mine

Usually one and done up she done up and looking beautiful
That don’t mean I’ma stunt her
No need to rush it, we got forever babygirl
We getting closer every moment I’ve been waiting for it
Ain’t saying I don’t need it, if you gave it I would take it
Have you shakin' I would break you off
Without a second thought, but you got my respect is all
And I can show you all this love without a bit of sex involved
Maybe I foreplay it, maybe I kiss it lady
And even if we don't speak, you still are in my matrix
That’s how this lovin be, love it when she under me
She say that she celibate, I penetrate her mentally
So if it’s meant to be, then it’s meant to be
Hold on to the now, cuz I know sex be changing everything
If it’s meant to be, then it’s meant to be
She say ""I think I’m ready, if it change just remember me""

If you ready then I'm ready go, hear this on my radio

Tell me where you want me go, nevermind I know what's up

Frequently hated, either that or misunderstood
But a wise woman told me ""it's okay to know you good""
They call it arrogance but I think it's passionate
And I think this happens when you rap and don't exaggerate
Shawty open your soul, pray that protools agree though
Me and my pupils is mutual they not focused as me though
See my flow is the nicest and my ho is the baddest
And the sex will lock her down see my stick is the gavel
Catalog growing, rappers skedaddle move over
She reluctantly fucking, she's an adamant blower
I'm a passionate poet, moonlight as rapping Folarin
Horse is missing on my Polo cause my tag is enormous
I ain't cocky I'm just proud of me
So why these niggas acting like I ain't allowed to be

[Chorus]
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude
[Verse 2]
Real nigga, pardon whoever feel different
How I grow to be 5'8
But it's still my little niggas
Chanel slippers on my bitches like you go love
And I love your brain but I think I'll never know enough
Argue with twitter niggas who insignificant
But its just simply my interest to intricately ridicule niggas
Proud of it all defensive fuck I'm rocking alone
Say what you want I'm Immature like Roger go home
Hard headed hot headed I admit it
But I'll be damned if they defeat me like a fucking prosthetic
Ha, Wale you so arrogant
Rozay told me break a leg no wonder why I care again
Stunting in a pair of Tiffs I don't mean a pair of Tims
Two bitches named Tiffany I left them with a pair of kids
Rare shit, trend setting yea I be the best
OD'd on that Mitchell-Ness you thought it was '03 again
Hold up yea we the best
Roll wit Ace, Khaled and them
Roll up niggas. weed like sex
Don't you leave a seed in there
Reading shit my critics say
Pitchfork doesn't need a plate
Not hungry for my poetry
They fasting they won't leave me ate
Six and a half, Optimistic this isnt bad
It's different now, Before the faith niggas was ""WHAM""
Carelessly whispering all they nickel opinions at me
Tell all my haters call they neighbor get they minions at me
A couple labels threw some millions yet they still ain't grab me
Nigga's talk they'd attacked me but wouldn't steal a taxi
Ha, and I ain't smug I'm just proud of me
Why they acting like a nigga ain't allowed to be
[Chorus]
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude

Ambition is definitely on the way

Don't hold your applause from me

[Verse 1]
Inspired by women, niggas say that I treat em different
Niggas be bitches, hoes be bitches, I don't see no difference
Shawty my aim is different, DC my English iffy
Solo I be but I'm on my feet, I got these angels with me
Tired of making money, I'm on to making history
Fuck how they feel, I keeps it realer than a documentary
Shit I be feeling like real niggas don't make it to 50
And I be feeling Malcolm, Martin, and Pac would defend me
I focus on chicken, my Corazon frigid
Don't trust no cheap rubbers, don't trust no dirty bitches
Sipping Moscato with models having exotic dishes
But it don't mean shit unless I know that my genre respected
I deserve praise, I deserve applause
Drawers by bad broads whenever the curtains call
It's all work, no days off
I'm on a great run, Wale Folarin

[Chorus]
Make sure that they always talk of me
Make sure these bitches in awe for me
Make sure to give them my all
And now they know that we on
Don't ever hold your applause for me
Don't ever hold your applause for me
Don't ever hold your applause for me
Don't ever hold your applause for me
And ay ay ay...
Don't ever hold your applause for me
[Verse 2]
GQ man of the year, Cudi, Drizzy and me
Went away for a little, let my wisdom increase
When you winning obese, all your haters fatigued
Got me counting my blessings, it took me A-D to see
When you rapping how you rapping, bitches pack up and leave
When you rapping how I'm rapping, they fellatio free
I was pacing myself, hope you patient as me
Plus I got a lot, niggas ain't make it to see it
We black niggas with ambition, they gon respect it
And I know I'm kinda vain, but what real nigga isn't
I'm tryna style on some bitches and keep it introspective
I'm tryna stun em like everybody was second guessed it
Wale

[Chorus]
Make sure that they always talk of me
Make sure these bitches in awe for me
Make sure to give them my all

I got my wallet on me, all eyes on us
One hand on the moon

Spend a little time on it
Never mind your friends, spend it all on you
I got this money on me, all eyes on us
One hand on the moon
Both eyes on you
And I'mma prolly OD
Spend a long time on it
And never mind your friends, I spend it all on you
New shit from Bergdorf, new shit from Virgil
Is your hair right? And what do you know?
She love that Saint Laurent, it's never too much
She love Fear of God, but she really fearin' love
When it be hot, I get you with a chauffeur
Shouldn't be drivin' baby, I ain't sober
Would I be out of line if I came over?
Cause don't nobody know ya like I know you
[Verse 1]
L-O-V-E please come to me
I eat it up at dinner, make your knees start to buckle
Kick your feet up woman, take it easy for a second
Be at peace for a moment
I got my wallet on me, and that ain't no bluff
They feel up their feelings quick
When you fill up the gold ones

I said please, time to have sex
Time is my chords and mine a Rolex
Yeah, never mind what folks say
They know my net worth, my gross is grotesque
One hope for a minute
TMZ flicking me, you my ghost for a minute
Back in the building, I'm rollin' Backwoods for my dogs
Talk to my niggas and I mean Robyn and Melissa
I'm too cool to trip off a chick who gold diggin'
Too much on Balmain, that's too many zippers
Too many women don't get my potential
I'm like Bishop Tutu with 2Pac aggression
It's on me is it the vibe or the low?
You memorize the monologue
Dig it? I'm tryna get impromptu yeah
I do this for real
You do this a little
You knew I come through, my laptop got that Hulu
Run through your hula hoop, no 'Netflix and Chill'
Hear your phone girl, why you not replyin'?
Oh my God, stop fuckin' lyin'

Plenty nights I went out with squad
You felt neglected
If I know you was gonna break your word

And you got me blowing up your phone
I’m feeling desperate
She used to be with me a lot
And I put you through a lot
Don't break my heart girl
Please don't break my heart
Don’t break my heart girl
Please don't break my heart
Don't break my heart girl

Don't break my heart girl
Please don't break my heart

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I told her she my queen so I'ma bow down
I might fuck you on your cycle, lay the towel down (Nasty)
When I fuck you from the back you make a loud sound
She only fucked on two niggas, that's something to be proud about
And you know I trust this bitch, she logged in my bank account
Pop up new chain, favorite rapper 2 Chainz
Fucked a bitch from blue flames
[Verse 2: Wale]
Rápido like Usain
I be lunchin’ sometimes
I can’t expect you to stay
You deserve a bouquet
You deserve a true label
Fuck a post on a page
You're supposed to be great (Yeah)
And I just lie in your face
You just laugh in your head
""Why this nigga so fake?"" (Yeah)
Yeah, and on the real we should break up
Run away at your pace
’Cause I'm a walking mistake
I try to buy my way out
You keep the gifts but they lame
Replace these commas with rockets
'Cause you would rather your space
She gonna find her solace in knowing a nigga damaged
So she gonna take my heart 'cause a nigga took her for granted
Damn it

I only gave you my heart, you ain’t protect it

This is a story about this shawty I knew
Kicked in DC United but now I bid her adieu
She was really too pressed
Me, I was really too rude
So I got caught with my pants down
I shoulda gave her the moon
Now I live in denial
You fallin' back and you cool
No longer apple of eye
That's why my texts ain't blue
A woman heart isn't black
Until all your texts ain't blue
It's bittersweet, she can't ignore
What can never get through (Yeah)
Still at the door
Desperate, immature
Got your sister saying
""Sister, just say 'Roger go home'""
Share your view with the crew
We popular so it's rough
'Cause everybody know you and I
But nobody know us (Yeah)
I lied to you enough
Your pride swallowed too much
I'm sorry I said, ""sorry"" so much
That's what I've become
And it's over, it's done
You found somebody else
My first thought, do I know 'em?
When that shoulda been why I let him
Thought you'd keep me from cheating
With your abundance of love
I thought I'd keep you from cheating
I kept you cumming so much, but so what?
[Chorus: Lil Durk & Wale]
I only gave you my heart, you ain't protect it
(Shit, oh now you done done huh?)
Plenty nights I went out with squad
You felt neglected
(That's my fault, fessed it)
If I know you was gonna break your word
You shoulda kept it
(Fatality, casualty, baby)
And you got me blowing up your phone
I'm feeling desperate
She used to be with me a lot (A lot)
And I put you through a lot
Don't break my heart girl
Please don't break my heart (It's too late)
Don't break my heart girl
Please don't break my heart (Too late, yeah)

And they say don't ever change (change on me)
Although beautiful matrimony is a rapper balancing your women, your riches and at least half your homies
You're at the top, don't crack!

[Hook: Wale]
I've been doing my own thing
And they said don't never change
And I pray I stay the same
Want everything for everybody 'round me
I've been doing my own thing
And we said we'd never change
And I pray we stay the same
Fame changin' everybody 'round me

[Verse 1: Wale]
OK, good business with mad friends
(and we said we'd never change)
Or bad business with mad friends, aha, glass egg
Used to be my homie, me and you was chillin' though
Now that shit got cold like the OG with that finger roll
That Spur, probably cop it, 'cause the more I drink Wallace
And it's worse when they even in their fillings of your pockets
Then I got my deal
Started wondering if them hittas with me are for real
Mmm, I figure them'll do it, not us
Mmm, the bond was thick, now just the plot is
And isn't it ironic, getting a name can make you anonymous
My newest of hobbies, collecting calls from the lock-ups
Tell em I know he's so sick of the walls, when he get home, he going shopping
Mmm, look at the time that caught us
Talked to the times while younger and maybe getting your life in order
Real hitta for life, better not look at the price
Better not look at that register, everything in here's light
Mmm, 'cause I'm Jah doin' a'ight
Look at how the moral of the story, but don't see its advice
It's right, it's like life is like a glass egg
Tryna maintain what come with the fame and keeping your last friends
Yeah, you know that balance a bitch
'Cause who on your back or who got your back
I promise the line is this thin, really, really
You know that balance a bitch
'Cause who on your back or who got your back
I promise the line is this thin
[Interlude: Jerry Seinfeld]
I got this glass egg somehow on the top of this, balanced
On the top of this mountain, you know?
I don't know how i got it there exactly
But I see it's there and I got to end this with the right feeling

[Verse 2: Wale]
OK, good business with mad friends
(and we said we'd never change)
Or bad business with mad friends, aha, glass egg
Look at the years invested, who would have figured or guessed it (pa?)
Look at you there since Contra kept the code but you’ve got extra men
Told you I would get this straight, told you once i got big
It's lonely at the top by the population looking in, ahh
Then I got my deal
Started wondering if them hittas with me are for real (sometimes the money let the devil in)
Yeah, now salutations to my former friends
Forming to form against me is currently your form of defense
And now it hurts me to say
Sometimes your sandbox friends equipped for dirty exchange
Now was it worth all that bling in a hurt or sustain at curtain calls
One of two that either boo or bouquets, so was it
Worth of your fam or worth all the fame
Exchange your personal relationships for personal gains
I'm telling you, balance is a bitch
'Cause when you're back, who got your back
I promise the line is this thin, really, uh
I'm telling you, balance is a bitch
'Cause who on your back, and who got your back
Sometimes that line don't exist, I'm out

Attire proper, Bryce Harper though slightly darker
From where the drivers forgotten, you get blocka for parkas
Ronald’s was poppin, they be wildin' for posites
Shorty from Wahler Place say Wale don't stop up your progress
It's not a problem, little mama, only a part of me polished
I get inside her head and promptly get Kylie Minoguing
Slick mouth, nigga, legendary with lyrics
And never let up, keep one leg up, nigga Kerry Kittles
It's very simple, I'm in it so now you never winning
And I'm up about fifty effortlessly, nigga, check the ticker
Fuck a nigga, hate a hater, that’s just how I’m living
And I'm playin' ball with a chess board, nigga; Bobby Fischer
And it's hard to be focused going around all these women
I tell her I'm much deeper, that don't mean I'm much different
More like the writing, Iceberg Slim with better diction
She let me hit her in the gut, feel it like premonitions
Wooh, you know I'm feeling myself
Tell these niggas Folarin back on my way to that belt
By the way of the beltway, where they hatin' too much
When niggas dirty, thirsty, hungry they subjects to lunch
Right? But at least we see that's the problem being not on
I aspire for well-off, y'all aspire for well-known
Not no LeBron, but I'm cool with being Jamal
Cross, somebody falling, don't keep reaching, let me just ball
Just bored with these groupies, been tired of these niggas
They ain't seeing me stunting, like a tint-job on a Bentley
Your annual is my rent fee, been playing it cool, don't tempt me
Fuck that, but nah, I take 'em out to lunch, I'm a cannibal to these emcees
Ever so gluttonous, miss me with that sucker shit
Tatted out with angels
Since I pray I don't get caught up in this game, nigga
Not a chance, nigga
About a dollar so they hollering I changed, nigga
