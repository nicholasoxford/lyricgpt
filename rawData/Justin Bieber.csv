[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Verse 2]
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
[Bridge]
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body

Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me goin' crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don't need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really wanna see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, 'cause she was so amazin'
And now my heart is breakin', but I just keep on sayin'

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions

You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening

Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long, long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh, yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone, and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why

[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
What's a king, babe, without a queen?
There ain't no ""I"" in team
You make me complete, you're all that matters to me

[Verse 2]
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you
Oh-oh, I'm grateful for your existence
Faithful no matter the distance
You're the only girl I see
From the bottom of my heart, please believe
[Chorus]
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else

Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As

And his arms a little bit longer than me

Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood (Let's go!)

Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
[Verse 2]
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again
[Bridge]
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

[Chorus]
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day

Happy birthday

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain’t never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain’t ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary (yeah)
Don't want us to lose what we are
(Don't wanna lose, no)
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are

[Verse 3: Nas]
She texts me ""How's you love life?""
And ""How are you?"", I said ""I'm good""
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer

Well let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

[Chorus]
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out

What's gonna make you fall in love?

Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, ""Hello,"" I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you

I got back to 2015 and you started lookin' young, so I stopped (Ooh)

I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more, guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, that's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately

I love you, need you
Need you here to stay

Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
""I love you, need you, need you here to stay""

[Hook: Justin Bieber]
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' ""Finally Famous!"" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don

Our finest gifts we bring, pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the king, pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

[Chorus: Justin Bieber & (Busta Rhymes)]
Little baby, pa rum pum pum pum (Yeah)
I am a poor boy too, pa rum pum pum pum
(Let's gather 'round the mistletoe real quick)
I have no gifts to bring, pa rum pum pum pum
(Matter fact, let's gather 'round the fireplace, it's about to get hot in here)
Nothing to give our king (Bieber, what up?), pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
(I'ma needa get straight to it)
[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, ""Let's make it hot up in the winter"", I said ""Cool""
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my drum for him, pa rum pa pum pum
I played my best for him, pa rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum, rum pa pum pum

[Verse 3: Justin Bieber]
If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe

Damn damn J.B, where the hell you been
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds
2 big face Rollies, no I ain't lyin'
Making momma so proud that she cryin'
Yeah you say I'm crazy? Guess that makes two
But I never knew that dreams really came true
Started playing drums when I was only 2
Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses
Wait...I'm not done

[Verse 2]
I thanked Jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun' of these cause baby I'm a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that ""It's not mine""
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry

So DJ, bring that, bring that, bring that, bring that back

All around the world, people want to be loved, yeah

Once again (All around the world-world-world)
The dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
All around the world, people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world
(All around the world, the world, people wanna be loved)

Don't be ashamed, girl, I messed around, you messed up too
It all changed when you took my name and went insane, mmm

Had a dream, I was high
Holdin' on to the sky
But I heard your voice and stopped myself from fallin'
There'll be days, there'll be nights
When the stars don't align
And the sun can't even stop the rain from pourin'

So lay with me and let time just pass by
And don't let go (Don't let go)
'Cause all I know

This life is crazy
But it led me to your love
If you call on me forever I will come
No matter what, baby

We'll be diamond when our golden days are done
No matter what (What), no mattеr what (What)
It's only us (It's only us)
Yeah, no matter what

[Verse 2]
Got you good, in the bag
Evеrything that I have
When the silence fills the air, just know I'm on it
When the waves start to crash
Like a fear from the past
Just remember that you're all I've ever wanted (Ever wanted)

You can take it out on me

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light
And take it out on me
You can take it out on me
[Verse 2]
Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that

[Chorus]
You can take it out on me, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You can take it out on me, hey, hey, hey, hey
