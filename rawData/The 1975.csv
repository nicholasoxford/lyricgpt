And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without

Irony is okay, I suppose
Culture is to blame
You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
You lack substance when you say something like, ""Oh, what a shame""

I'm assuming you'll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon and start consuming like a human, that's what I am assuming

I'm sure that you're not just another girl
I'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist

Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers?
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in

And why would you believe you could control how you're perceived
When at your best you're intermediately versed in your own feelings?

On bikes from schools and cars
With autumn leaves fallen sparse across mid-afternoon
She blazed about how cultural language is an operating system
A simple interface rendered feeble and listless
When tested with divinity or a true understanding of the human condition
I never did understand – the duality of art and reality – living life and treating it as such but with a certain disconnect
To touch that cajoles at the artist with comfort and abandon, and between the spires and rolling roofs of the white city

You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29

So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?

[Verse 2]
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like

Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give yourself a try?
Won't you give?
[Verse 3]
And what would you say to your younger self?
Growing a beard's quite hard
And whiskey never starts to taste nice
And you'll make a lot of money, and it's funny
'Cause you'll move somewhere sunny and get addicted to drugs
And spend obscene amounts on fucking seeds and beans online

And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket

On my girlfriend again

As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts

You would cook, I'd do the nappies (Nappies)
We went to Winter Wonderland
And it was shit, but we were happy (Happy)

There's a place
I've been going

Now I'm clean

Let's go somewhere I'll be seen
As sad as it seems
I seen Greg and he was like
""I seen your friends at the birthday party
They were kinda fucked up before it even started
They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show
They didn't know about all the weird stuff
So they just left it"" (So they just left it)
I was wasted (I was wasted)
And cold
And minding my business

[Verse 2]
And I seen the girls and they were all like
""Do you wanna come and get fucked up?""
Listen, I got myself a missus, says there can't be any kissing
""No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid
It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it""
[Verse 3]
""This ain't going well""
I thought that I was stuck in Hell
In a boring conversation with a girl called Mel
About her friend in Cincinnati called Matty as well
You pulled away when I went in for the kiss
No, it wasn't a diss
You put the tap on to cover up the sound of your piss
After four years, don't you think I'm over all this?
""That's rich from a man who can't shit in a hotel room
He's gotta share for a bit""
You make a little hobby out of going to the lobby
To get things that they don't have

[Verse 4]
Does it go through ya when I'm talking to ya?
You know that I could sue ya if we're married
And you fuck up again
Impress myself with stealth and bad health
And my wealth and progressive causes
Then drink your kombucha and buy an Ed Ruscha
Surely, it's a print 'cause I'm not made of it
Look, the fucking state of it
I came pretty late to it
We can still be mates 'cause it's only a picture

In one place
Oh, we're a scene

Imagine if you just did
I'd fill you in on the things you missed
Oh, sleepless Knights, a grown up man dressed in white
Who I thought might just save your life
But he couldn't, so you died
I don't like it, now you're dead
It's not the same when I scratch my own head
I haven't got the nails for it
And I know that God doesn't exist
And all the palaver surrounding it
But I like to think you hear me sometimes
So I reached for a borrowed fleece
From my dad or from Denise
Always trying to keep warm, when you're the sun
I sat with you beside your bed and cried
For things that I wish I'd said
You still had your nails red
And if I live past 72, I hope I'm half as cool as you
I got my pen and thought that I'd write
A melody and line for you tonight
I think that's how I make things feel alright
Made in my room, this simple tune
Will always keep me close to you
The crowds will sing their voices ring
And it's like you never left
But I'm bereft you see
I think you can tell
I haven't been doing too well17Embed"

And well, I think I've gone mad
Isn't that so sad?
And what a shame you've lost a brain that you never had
Oh, mum, check the car it can’t have gone far
I must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
It’s likely in a Sainsbury’s
Flirting with the girls and waiting for me
I jumped on a bus, declared my name
And asked if anybody's seen my brain
""Your brain was last seen going for a run
And would you sign an autograph for my daughter Laura?
'Cause she adores you
But I think you’re shit""
""I've gotta look for my brain for a bit!”
I stepped outside, it hurt my eyes
“Well what do you expect when you’ve got no mind!”
I searched all day it drove me insane
“Where would I be if I was my brain?”

But she couldn't find a single trace of my brain

[Spoken Word: Siri (British Male)]
This is a story about a lonely, lonely man. He lived in a lonely house. On a lonely street. In a lonely part of the world. But, of course, he had the internet. The internet, as you know, was his friend — you could say, his best friend. They would play with each other every day, watching videos of humans doing all sorts of things: Having sex with each other; Informing people on what was wrong with them and their life; Playing games with young children at home with their parents

One day, the man — whose name was @SnowflakeSmasher86 — turned to his friend, the internet, and he said, “Internet, do you love me?”

The internet looked at him and said, “Yes. I love you very, very, very, very, very, very much. I am your best friend. In fact, I love you so much that I never, ever want us to be apart ever again ever’
‘I would like that,” said the man. And so they embarked on a life together. Wherever the man went, he took his friend. The man and the internet went everywhere together, except of course the places where the internet could not go. They went to the countryside. They went to birthday parties of the children of some of his less important friends. Different countries. Even the moon. When the man got sad, his friend had so many clever ways to make him feel better. He would get him cooked animals and show him the people having sex again, and he would always, always agree with him. This one was the man’s favorite, and it made him very happy. The man trusted his friend so much. “I feel like I could tell you anything,” he said, on a particularly lonely day

“You can. You can tell me anything. I’m your best friend. Anything you say to me will stay strictly between you and the internet.”
And so he did. The man shared everything with his friend: All of his fears and desires; All of his loves, past and present; All of the places he had been and was going, and pictures of his penis. He would tell himself, “Man does not live by bread alone.”
And then he died
In his lonely house
On the lonely street
In that lonely part of the world
You can go on his Facebook

And I see your pyjamas
I can't stop smiling at you

Yeah 
Yeah 
Jag tänker det här, det hör inte riktigt hemma här

We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis
And  we need to call it what it is
An  emergency
We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control
And  that we don't have all the solutions yet
Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things
We must admit that we are losing this battle
We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed
All  political movements in their present form have failed
But Homo sapiens have not yet failed
Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around
We can still fix this
We still have everything in our own hands
But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems
We most probably don't stand a chance

We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people
And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say
Now is the time to speak clearly
Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced
The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it
We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases
And either we do that, or we don't
You say that nothing in life is black or white
But that is a lie, a very dangerous lie
Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don't
Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don't
Either we choose to go on as our civilization, or we don't
That is as black or white as it gets
Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival
Now, we all have a choice
We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations
Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail
That is up to you and me
And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change
But you cannot have one without the other
If you look through history
All the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level
People like you and me
So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible
To do your best is no longer good enough
We must all do the seemingly impossible
Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day
There are no politics to change that
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground
So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules
Because the rules have to be changed
Everything needs to change, and it has to start today
So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience
It is time to rebel17Embed"

What was the idea behind the track?

Matty Healy: My Nana who I was close to died of cancer this year and it was around about that time that the guitarist’s mum got diagnosed with cancer and it felt like it was a big impact, the fact that something you have no control over can really mess with the dynamics of people’s lives. It’s actually a live guitar take. I was playing the guitar plugged in the computer and George was putting it through every plugin you can imagine. He recorded it without telling me so I was in the zone. This was 2am on a Saturday night so we were under the influence. I recorded the guitar take and we listened to it back hammered and we were like ‘this is really pretty man, nah let’s get some sleep’. We woke up the next day and we just spent like half an hour putting little moments of vocals and synth and that was that. I think Music for Cars is the most honest record in regards to things like that11Embed"
