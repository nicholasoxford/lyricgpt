[Intro: Big Sean]
Mhm, I look up
Yeah, and I take my time, nigga
I'ma take my time, woah
Mhm, power moves only, nigga

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Boy, I'm 'bout my business on business, I drink liquor on liquor
I had women on women: yeah, that's bunk-bed bitches
I've done lived more than an 80-year-old man still kickin'
‘Cause they live for some moments, and I live for a livin'
But this for the girls who barely let me get to first base
On some ground ball shit
‘Cause now I run my city on some town hall shit
They prayin' on my motherfuckin' downfall, bitch
Like a drought, but you gon' get this rain like it's May weather
G.O.O.D. Music, 'Ye weather
Champagne just tastes better
They told me I never, boy, never say never
Swear flow special like an infant's first steps
I got paid then reversed debts
Then I finally found a girl that reverse stress
So now I'm talkin' to the reaper to reverse death
Yep, so I can kick it with my granddad, take him for a ride
Show him I made somethin' out myself and not just tried
Show him the house I bought the fam, let him tour inside
No matter how far ahead I get, I always feel behind in my mind
But fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I said fuck tryin' and not doin'
‘Cause not doin' is somethin' a nigga not doin'
I grew up to Em, B.I.G., and Pac, bitch, and got ruined
So until I got the same crib B.I.G. had in that ""Juicy"" vid
Bitch, I can't motherfuckin' stop movin'
Go against me, you won't stop losin'
From the city where every month is May-Day at home, spray your dome
Niggas get sprayed up like A.K. was cologne for a paycheck or loan
Yeah, I know that shit ain't fair
They say Detroit ain't got a chance, we ain't even got a mayor
You write your name with a Sharpie, I write mine in stone
I knew the world was for the taking and wouldn't take long
We on, tryna be better than everybody that's better than everybody
Rep Detroit, everybody, Detroit vers' everybody
I'm so fuckin' first class I could spit up on every pilot
The city's my Metropolis, feel it, it's metabolic
And I'm over niggas sayin' they're the hottest niggas
Then run to the hottest niggas just to stay hot
I'm one of the hottest because I flame drop
Drop fire, and not because I'm namedroppin', Hall of Fame droppin'
And I ain't takin' shit from nobody unless they're OGs
‘Cause that ain't the way of a OG
So I G-O collect mo' Gs, every dollar
Never changed though, I'm just the new version of old me
Forever hot-headed but never got cold feet
Got up in the game, won't look back at my old seats
Clique so deep we take up the whole street
I need a bitch so bad that she take up my whole week
Sean Don
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Miscellaneous minds are never explainin' their minds
Devilish grin for my alias aliens to respond
Peddlin' sin, thinkin' maybe when you get old you realize
I'm not gonna fold or demise
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
Bitch, everything I rap is a quarter piece to your melon
So if you have a relapse, just relax and pop in my disc
Don't you pop me no fuckin' pill
I'ma pop you, then give you this

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell Flex to drop a bomb on this shit
So many bombs, ring the alarm, like Vietnam on this shit
So many bombs, make Farrakhan think that Saddam in this bitch
One at a time, I line them up
And bomb on they mom while she watchin' the kids
I'm in a destruction mode if the gold exists
I'm important like the Pope, I'm a Muslim on pork
I'm Makaveli's offspring, I'm the King of New York
King of the Coast; one hand, I juggle 'em both
The juggernaut's all in your jugular, you take me for jokes
Live in the basement, church pews, and funeral faces
Cartier bracelets for my women friends, I'm in Vegas
Who the fuck y'all thought it's supposed to be?
If Phil Jackson came back, still no coachin' me
I'm uncoachable, I'm unsociable, fuck y'all clubs!
Fuck y'all pictures! Your Instagram can gobble these nuts!
Gobble dick up 'til you hiccup, my big homie Kurupt
This the same flow that put the rap game on a crutch
(West, West, West, West, West, West)
I've seen niggas transform like villain Decepticons
Mollies probably turn these niggas to fuckin' Lindsay Lohan
A bunch of rich-ass white girls lookin' for parties
Playin' with Barbies
Wreck the Porsche before you give them the car key
Judgement to the monarchy, blessings to Paul McCartney
You called me a black Beatle, I'm either that or a Marley
I don't smoke crack, motherfucker, I sell it!
I'm dressed in all black, this is not for the fan of Elvis
I'm aimin' straight for your pelvis
You can't stomach me? You plan on stumpin' me?
Bitch, I’ve been jumped before you put a gun on me
Bitch, I put one on yours, I'm Sean Connery
James Bonding with none of you niggas
Climbin' 100 mil in front of me
And I'm gonna get it even if you're in the way
And if you're in it, better run for Pete's sake
I heard the barbershops be in great debates all the time
'Bout who's the best MC: Kendrick, Jigga, and Nas
Eminem, André 3000; the rest of y'all
New niggas just new niggas, don't get involved
And I ain't rockin' no more designer shit
White T’s and Nike Cortez, this red Corvette's anonymous
I'm usually homeboys with the same niggas I'm rhymin' with
But this is hip-hop, and them niggas should know what time it is
And that goes for Jermaine Cole, Big K.R.I.T., Wale
Pusha T, Meek Millz, A$AP Rocky, Drake
Big Sean, Jay Electron', Tyler, Mac Miller
I got love for you all, but I'm tryna murder you niggas
Tryna make sure your core fans never heard of you niggas
They don't wanna hear not one more noun or verb from you niggas
What is competition? I'm tryna raise the bar high
Who tryna jump and get it? You're better off tryna skydive
Out the exit window of five G5's with five grand
With your granddad as the pilot, he drunk as fuck, tryna land
With the hand full of arthritis and poppin' prosthetic leg
Bumpin' Pac in the cockpit so the shit that pops in his head
Is an option of violence, someone heard the stewardess said
That your parachute is a latex condom hooked to a dread
West Coast
[Verse 3: Jay Electronica]
You could check my name on the books
I Earth Wind & Fire’d the verse, then reigned on the hook
The legend of Dorothy Flowers proclaimed from the roof
The tale of a magnificent king who came from the nooks
Of the wild magnolia, mother of many soldiers
We live by every single word she ever told us
Watch over your shoulders
And keep a tin of beans for when the weather turn the coldest
The Lord is our shepherd, so our cup runneth over
Put your trust in the Lord, but tether your Chevy Nova
I’m spittin' this shit for closure
And God is my witness, so you could get it from Hova
To all you magicians that’s fidgetin' with the cobra
I’m solid as a rock, ‘cause I came from a rock
That’s why I came with the rock
Then signed my name on the Roc
Draw a line around some Earth, then put my name on the plot
‘Cause I endured a lot of pain for everythang that I got
The eyelashes like umbrellas when it rain from the heart
And the tissue is like an angel kissin' you in the dark
You go from blind sight to hindsight
Passion of the Christ, right, to baskin' in the limelight
It take time to get your mind right
Jay Electricity, PBS Mysteries
In a lofty place tanglin' with Satan over history
You can’t say shit to me, الحمد لله‎
It’s strictly by faith that we made it this far622Embed"

Fuck your two cents if it ain't goin' towards the bill, yeah
And every day I wake up celebratin' shit, why?
‘Cause I just dodged a bullet from a crazy bitch, I
Stuck to my guns (Woah,) that's what made me rich
That's what put me on, that's what got me here, that's what made me this (This)
And everything that I do is my first name (B-I-G)
These hoes chase bread, aw damn, she got a bird brain
Ain't nothin' but trill in me, aw man, silly me
I just bought a crib, three stories; that bitch a trilogy
And you know I'm rollin' weed that's fuckin' up the ozone

And then another one text (Swerve, swerve,) then your ass next
And I'ma text your ass back, like—

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a million things on my mind, executive deals online, limited amount of time
Chasin' these dollar signs and you ain't on your grind
You liable to find me up in the MGM casino in the D
Fuckin' off fetti I could've put on property
From the Bay to the Murder Mitten, my niggas put murder missions
She choosin', that's her decision, free my niggas in prison
On the phone with a bitch who can't do shit
For a pimp but make a nigga hella rich (Hella rich)
Got a blunt in my dental, blowin' hemp in a rental
On my way to Sacramento, late night; Arsenio (Arsenio)
I'm never sentimental, go hard or go homeless
Barely Harley, I'm chromeless (Uh,) you might end up domeless (Uh)
I bet you she into me, her cheddar, she givin' me
I'll make a bitch stand outside forever, like the Statue of Liberty (Mmm)
Rest in pimp, Pimp C, underground king of the South
I raise my styrofoam up, and pour some drink in my mouth (Pour up)
Why you always comin' around with bad news? (Bad news)
Say you want me to win, but hope I lose (Hope I lose)
Askin' if I rock with other niggas in the crew (Crew,) but them niggas cool (Cool)
It's just that—
[Pre-Chorus: Big Sean, E-40]

You lil' stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Uh-uh)
You lil', you lil' dumb ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for (God)
I got a new whip that I gotta thank the lot for (Swerve, swerve, swerve)
Yeah, I got a lot, but want a lot more
Yeah, we in the buildin', but I'm tryna take it to the top floor (Floor)
I swear I hear some new bullshit every day I'm wakin' up (Uh)
It seem like nowadays everybody breakin' up (Uh)
That shit can break ya down, if you lose a good girl
I guess you need a bad bitch to come around and make it up (Yup)
I guess drama makes for the best content
Everything got a bad side, even a conscience
Now you're drinkin' 'til you're unconscious (Woah,) feel me
When you get a fine bitch, just don't forget to read the fine print
Life got me meditatin' like I'm in the Himalayas
Keep it G with the L lit on me like the elevator
Yeah, I know that karma too real, so I hope you doin' cool
But still—
[Outro: Big Sean]
Stupid ass bitch, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu
No, no, no, no
Little stupid ass, I ain't fuckin' wit' (Woah)
I ain't fuckin', I ain't, I ain't fuckin' wit'chu (Woah)

Look
I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed
(Straight... up)
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I live the life I deserve, blessed
Fuck a vacay, I feel better at work
I mean, whatever it's worth, I give whatever I'm worth
For my niggas who gon' go to Hell and back for me
I'ma give 'em Heaven on Earth
Or a hell of a check, yeah, whichever come first
Blessings on blessings on blessings
Look at my life, man, that's lessons on lessons on lessons
I treat the beat like it's a reverend
I tell the truth like father, forgive me, these are all my confessions
Man, this wasn't luck, it was destined
I done lost homies who been with me since Ed, Edd n Eddy
Who flip like confetti
And then when you back, they back to call you ""dog""
That shit get-get petty
Bitch, don't give no dap to me, nigga
Funny thing about talking behind my back
Is that it just keep coming back to me, nigga
Was off for a sec, now it's back to me, nigga, you mad at me
This ain't what I want, man, this what it had to be
This is that late night working after three, man
This is why my old girl was mad at me
This why I'm your majesty, man
The clique is the tightest, the pussy the tightest
The drinks are the coldest, the future the brightest
The feat not divided, the love is divided
And I just gotta thank God that we got it
Blessed
I don't know what I would do without it
Crew look like we robbed a bank, but all we make is deposits
Your prophet will profit, oh God
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, I ain't gon' say that we back or nothing
‘Cause that implies that we're back from something
If we're back from somethin' there's some checks you owe us
I expect that payment, nothing less or over
I don't need them favors that you ask me for
I could give two fucks 'bout where the Grammys go
I just gave out Grammys on my Instagram
Them OVO boys, the business man
It is what it is, trust me, you get what you give, yeah
You gotta come to my side and see how we live, yeah
I cannot see Heaven being much better than this, yeah
Blessings on blessings for me and my niggas from the 6
Look at what we did, yeah
Be quiet, I'm doing a toast
For niggas that don't really do shit, I swear, y'all be doing the most
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
I am just worried 'bout my mama worrying less
I think I'm famous enough
I don't need any more press
I am convinced I'm the only one left that's still doing this shit, man
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
My grandma just died, I'm the man of the house
So every morning I'm up ‘cause I can't let them down, down
Always down for the cause, never down for the count
I guess when your stars align
You do like the solar system and plan it out
So I'm going over time, on the overtime
Yeah, I'm that invested, but you can't attest it
Million dollar goals, managed to manifest it
The family never going anorexic
I pay my own mortgage and electric
Never going under even with anesthetics
At the top of the rap game and progressin'
Check after check, checking off my check list
Try and blow my cake, just know that's a death wish
No mistakes in life ever, it's only lessons
Shit feel like Shaq and Penny got back together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I
[Chorus: Drake & Big Sean]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed
[Verse 4: Kanye West]
Since the truth keep niggas traumatized
They tryna compromise my condom size
So I Snapchat that whole shit
Tryna see titties, tryna show dick
And I swear to God, I hope they post it, I'm blessed
Even though I get slammed with lawsuits like car doors
See three P.O.'s like Star Wars
They want me by the road holding up cardboard
So I go extra hard on the hard floor
Right now, I'm calling you from my home gym
Right after that, nigga, I'm gon' swim
Just did a couple laps in my home pool
And my daughter right there getting home-schooled, I'm blessed
And I was thinking 'bout starting up my own school, a Montessori
And the hallway looking like a monastery, oh, yes
I'm way up, I feel blessed1.4KEmbed"

If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back
(You ain’t getting checks)
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don’t owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me 'cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like a edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star-studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I’m never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out 'cause I’m enlightened
God talk to me in silence
But I hear him every time, mane
(Thank you, God, God bless you, thank you so much)
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, I woke up in beast mode
With my girl, that's beauty and the beast though
Been top 5, these niggas sleep though
Only thing that sold out is the seats though
(Never sold my soul, never will never have)
Nigga how dare you stand before me and not respect my authority
If you fuck with my glory, I'ma drop the L and get gory
I done did everything except worry
Hella drama, my life story
Faith of a mustard seed, I kept growing
I knew that this life was meant for me
Niggas change up more than wishin' wells
Karma come around I'll wish 'em well
Livin' like I’m on a limitless pill
I kill the scene like I’m Denzel
Crazy like my jacket strapped up
Nigga, I don’t act but I'll act up
Brown paper bag like the lunch packed up
Back, back, back, back up
Nigga, I'ma need like 10 feet
Or get stomped out with ten feet
I'ma always lose my temper
You cannot “count to ten” me
If I lose 1, I bounce back like 2, 3 did with 4, 5
Seen courtrooms and court sides, ain’t too many seen both sides
Nigga, fuck what you know
Nigga, I’m takin' back control
The underdog just turned into the wolf and the hunger steady grows
Yeah, I call shots while you call off
Never takin' summer or fall off
When you stay that committed to it, you just fall down and never fall off, so
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Wake up every morning, by the night, I count stacks
Knew that ass was real when I hit, it bounce back

Last night took a L, but tonight I bounce back
Boy, I been broke as hell, cashed a check and bounced back
D town LAX, every week I bounce back
If you a real one, then you know how to bounce back

Bounce back, bounce, bounce
Bounce back, bounce, bounce

When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Yeah, praying to a sky all black
Looking at the stars like they finna talk back
Looking at my phone like she finna call back
But last night I feel like probably ended all that
'Cause by now, she woulda sent a text in all caps
Then another one tryna take it all back
Saying ""Fuck you,"" ""I miss you,"" or ""I hate you so much""
'Cause girls only say ""hate you"" to the guys that they love
I know, I know, I know
The highs, the lows it comes, it goes
You say ""Be real,"" I try, I don't
'Cause you take anything and just make it everything (God)
Kept my phone on silent ever since you got a ring, funny, right?
And I never cheated; I mean, maybe once or twice
But one time don't change everything
She ask why I don't feel the same, I'm still the same
She's still insane and now she's saying

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?

Okay, skeet, smoke, sleep, call, miss, text, woke, spoke
Lie, feel, Lisa, ew, time, kill, months, still

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I got somebody baby mama calling me daddy (Yup)
I drank too much, please call me a cabby (Swerve)
Penthouse afterparty, hoes want the addy (Swerve)
Fuck, they can ride with us, crawl in the Caddy
Third row, that's when you call, I hit cancel
Really, I hit answer, fuck, I hate when that happens
Phone in my pocket for the whole night
And you heard bitches screaming 'til my phone died
Then she text me like, ""Why you still talk to my mama?
How the fuck you run around with condoms?
Why you make me get this tattoo? Man, fuck this tattoo
You the reason I wasn't single in college
What, all because I had you?
Nigga, I don't even have you
How I'm supposed to get past you?""
Then she called the next guy, spillin' some real shit
Now they problems that he got to deal with

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]

Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart?

You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Girl, don't believe them hoes
'Cause they don't wanna see us together
And you already know you're too fly
But baby, don't get your hair caught in the propellers
I be tryna tell her these hoes is jealous
You know they never like it when you never say never
Long hair, red bone, but her pussy is hairless
Mwah, I french kiss it like we in Paris
I be screaming out, ""Ain't no woman like the one I got!""
But she be always worrying about the one I fucked
She said it's gonna be me, myself and I
Damn, that'd make me a one-eyed fuck
I was so mad
Damn, you used to ride a nigga like a moped
But players fuck up, my bad
And just to keep from crying, I laughed

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, Lil Wayne, Big Sean, Jhené Aiko & Lil Wayne]
When you said it was over, you shot right through my heart (Tunechi)
Why you let these hoes tear what we had right apart
Ooh, I was so mad, I should've seen this coming right from the start (Damn)
You should beware, beware, beware of a woman with a broken heart

Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I'm about gettin' the job done, boy up every night
I'm about rollin' a seven when I toss up the dice
I'm about gettin' my logo all flooded with ice
I'm about takin' a risk that might fuck up your life
Tell 'em point and shoot like camera crews
In front of cameras too (Brrr!)
Damn, Sean, what happened to the humble attitude?
I'm like, ""Niggas took the flow, but I'm still standin' too.""
Thought I had the Midas touch, and then I went platinum too
Motherfuck all your comparisons (Fuck 'em!)
I've been talkin' to God like that's my therapist
I'm African-American in America, I ain't inherit shit
But a millionaire under 30 so He must be hearin' shit
Don, don, don life, I do this for the crib, the D to Flint
Kids who get sick with lead, others get hit with the lead
From where they need a handout, but they tell you put hands up
Only deals I had was from the Sam's Club
Now it's blue blood in my veins, though you know what I came for
Born in a world goin' where they told me I can't go
In my lane though, I'm in the same boat as Usain Bolt
Get ahead by any means so the head's what I aim for
When my grandma died I realized I got an angel
Show me everything's a blessing dependin' on the angles
Look, I am the anomaly, never needed favors or apologies
That's my new lifetime policy
Woodgrain steering wheel, this bitch feel like a pirate ship
How many hot verses 'til you bitches start acknowledgin'
The pictures we been paintin'? My nigga
Connected to a higher power—how I know?
'Cause I don't write this shit: I think it, my nigga
Look, all I ever did was beat the odds
'Cause when you try to get even it just don't even out
Never stoppin' like we hypnotized
Watch what we visualize on the rise
Be the G.O.A.T. while we alive; when we die, we gon' be the gods
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it

And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors

[Verse 2: Eminem]
If she was flavor, I won't save her
No taste buds, ho, later!
Fuck you lookin' at, hater?
I saw them eyes like an ass raper
Try to copy my swag like a cheating classmate
I'll be the last face you see 'fore you pass
When you get your fuckin' ass graded like a math paper
So ahead of my time, ""late"" means I'm early
My age is reversing, I'm basically thirty
Amazingly sturdy, zany and wordy
Brainy and nerdy, blatantly dirty
Insanely perverted, rapey and scurvy
They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos
It may be disturbing, what I'm saying's cringeworthy
But I'm urinating on Fergie, call Shady number 81
Surely I'm turning into the Aaron Hernandez of rap
State of emergency, the planet's having panic attacks
Brady's returning, matter of fact I may be deserving
Of a pat on the back like a Patriots jersey
Inexplicable stomach growl from the pit of it
Like a fuckin' Terrier hid in it
Despicable, dumb it down, ridiculous
Tongue is foul, shoot off at the fuckin' mouth
Like a missile, a thunder cloud
Hundred pound pistol, pull the trigger, this gun will sound
And you'll get a round like Digital Underground
And fuck Ann Coulter with a Klan poster
With a lamp post, door handle, shutter
A damn bolt cutter, a sandal, a can opener
A candle, rubber, piano, a flannel, sucker
Some hand soap, butter, a banjo and manhole cover
Hand over the mouth and nose smother
Trample ran over the tramp with the Land Rover
The band, the Lambo, Hummer and Road Runner
Go ham donut, or go Rambo, gut her, make an example of her
That's for Sandra Bland, ho, and Philando
Hannibal on the lam, no wonder I am so stubborn
I'm anti, can't no government handle a commando
Your man don't want it
Trump's a bitch, I'll make his whole brand go under (Yeah)
And tell Dre I'm meeting him in L.A
White Bronco like Elway, speeding
I'm 'bout to run over a chick, Del Rey CD in?
Females stay beating 'em
Bet you they'll lay bleeding, and yell, ""wait,"" pleading
But screaming is pointless like feeding Michel'le helium
Leaving 'em pale-faced, medium-sized welt
Straight treating 'em like a cellmate
Seedy, I'm climbing hell's gate
Bitch, I'm like your problems: self-made
Meaning someone else's help ain't needed, 'cause I'ma—
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Make it, make it, make it, boy, we gotta make it
You can save your hand, I ain't gotta shake it
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors
Clique too big, bread gotta break it
'Cause these others lowkey with the snakin', fakin'
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors, no favors
What I need? No favors
Everything lined up for the takin'
And what I need from 'em? No favors

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I know you've been goin' through some things, uh-huh
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you on a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Dancin', dancin', dancin' like you fucking got a reason
Dancing like it's something to believe in
Dancing like it's fuckin' dancing season
Blame it on the alcohol or blame it on sativa
The harder your heart keep beating
Only feel bad while you're thinkin'
Pop, pop, pop like Pepsi Co. the best we smoke
Plus the tan look like you flew in from Mexico
Go go, let me see how wild it get, bust it wide as it get
You need to be taken care of and pampered
But just like a pamper, he on that childish shit
Yeah, I know you've been silencing your phone
(Silencing your phone, ignoring calls from home)
Uh-huh, I know you've been tryna get along
What's up, it's on, no games, we grown
I know you feel like sometimes
That y'all don't speak the same language
Uh-huh, I know that you just wanna let it go
With all the bitches that you came with
[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been going through some thangs
Wanna get away, baby, let me be your vacation
That other trick you've been fuckin' with is a trip
You know she be playin', baby I am just saying
I know you know I am down for whatever, yeah
You know I'm just here to make you feel better, yeah
Take a load off on my private island
Come inside and go into hiding
I know that you've been sacrificing your time
And need time to unwind and let go
So let go and let's go and let's roll and we roll

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Excited, activated get ignited
So many charges on my card, oh God I think it got indicted
Get a, get a night, get a day, get a room, get a place
Get a drink, pop a bottle, maybe we can get away
You a star, you need space, we can shoot up out of town
Have you ever been to Texas? South By Southwestern
Where we can smoke a zip like we can't get arrested
Where they might know us off any intersection
I mean baby I know you've been, wanna be the baddest
Wanna be with somebody who ain't never had it
No status, just all cinematics, you just gotta cast it
[Bridge: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
I know you've been crying and poutin'
Know you're tired of arguing but no screaming and shouting
And you know we on a roll like we did good in college
Throwin' hundreds and thousands
Like they not hundreds and thousands

[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhene Aiko]
Why? Cause I know you've been going through some things
I know you've been going through some things you can't explain
With your main thing that shit insane
I know you just tryna maintain, that shit is lame, you can't complain
I know you don't even love the same, do you, do you?
Don't love the same, I know you've been diving through pain
I know you goin' so crazy, I know you runnin' on empty
That shit can fuck with your mente
I know this shit, don't you tempt me, I know you...
I know you've been runnin' on empty, runnin' on empty
The way you move it's like you could use a vacation
I know you, I know you
Drink in your hand and the harder you dance
I swear right now it look like you want a vacation
Gotta get away, make it happen
Whatever happened just had to happen
On vacation, yeah
I know you've been, I know you've been

[Intro: Big Sean]
They used to tell me, used to tell me

[Chorus: Big Sean]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls that's pretty at everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man could change the world
That one man could change the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I, all I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad chick
Imagined this so much, some nights it felt like that I had it
Back on the mattress, starin' at the ceilin' tryna connect the dots
But it's hard makin' those attachments
I'm talkin' dreamin' so hard, some nights it felt like draft day
You know? My - my stepbrother used to flip them bags
Outside the crib like it was trash day
No Kim K, but he bagged yay (Ye)
But when you're gettin' fast money, slow down, don't crash
With all the drive in the world, swear you still need gas
Look, think about it, close your eyes, dream about it
Tell your team about it, go make million-dollar schemes about it
Success is on the way, I feel it in the distance
Used to look up at the stars
And be like, ""Ain't too much that's different""
I be shinin', they be shinin', get your one shot, don't you miss it
What you know bout' wakin' up every day like you on a mission?
[Chorus: Kanye West]
And I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, one man could change the world
One man could change the world

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
My grandma told me, ""If you write your name in stone
You'll never get the white-out""
I grinded out that black hole then performed up at the White House
Standin' next to Jim Carrey, we traded stories, then laughed
I said you not the only one I know got rich wearin' masks
Where I'm from, I swear they broke
They need way more than the cast
We need more than what you have
And then we need more than that
But how am I supposed to say I'm tired
If that girl from West Virginia came up in conditions
That I couldn't survive?
Went to war, came back alive
On top of that became a female black captain
When being black, you had to extra-extra try
Way before James Brown made us proud
She bought a crib on the same street as Marvin Gaye
Right there on Outer Drive, and she taught me how to drive
And she raised the kids, then the kids' kids, and she did it right
Taught me how to love, taught me not to cry
When I die, I hope you teach me how to fly
All my life you've been that angel in disguise, sayin'...
[Chorus: John Legend]
I hope you learn to make it on your own
And if you love yourself, just know you'll never be alone
I hope that you get everything you want and that you chose
I hope that it's the realest thing that you ever know
Hope you get the pretty girls, that's pretty and everything
Million-dollar cribs, havin' million dollar dreams
And when you get it all, just remember one thing
Remember one thing, that one man can change the world
That one man can change the world

Yeah, and we G.O.O.D
Keep talkin' about this shit but whatever
We can go back and forth all day

(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby, lit for your love
(Live for your love)
Lit for your love baby (Straight up!)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
That's that don't play! Whuh! That's that new Ye
People sayin' I'm the closest thing to Mike since Janet, whuh!
Tom Cruise, homie, we jumpin' up on them couches
That's a fresh house, is that a guest house?
Your house got another house?
Your bitch got a bitch, your spouse got another spouse
Young Walt Disney, I'ma tell you truthfully
If you leave Mickey you gon' end up with a Goofy
I imagine that's what Chris told Karrueche
Girls be actin' like it's diamonds in they coochie
I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
But cops chokin' niggas out in the media
We finna have to protest and tear the city up
We 'bout to tear this whole place up, pretty much
(How much I live)
[Bridge: Kanye West]
And you know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, babe
You know it's all your fault
Nobody, nobody, nobody, but me

Hoe, we done made it through hell and disaster
My crib done got bigger, my women got badder
You wonderin', ""How do you get in the game?""
I'm wonderin', ""How do I get to the rafters?""
Oh boy, I'm mad until these records gettin' shattered
'Til I'm MJ or Magic, ooh, and she just want the status
So, you the man she got, but I'm the man that she been after
She done sent so many naked pics, my phone ain't got no data
I walk off in New York like my name Derek Jeter
Headed home to the D where you know I keep a Gina (Gina!)
I'm the good with the evil; fuck you, nice to meet you
You can't have a peace sign, man, without the middle finger
With the clique when you see us, that's my family to me
That's my family tree, they're my arms, legs, hands, and my feet
And I can't cut them off with even diabetes
Hit the beat and kerosene it; scratch that, I white sheet it
A 100 dollar fade every single time you see us
Been a king all my life so I shoulda got a Caesar
Somewhere off in Vegas rollin' dice up at the Caesar's
Got me thinkin' back bout how I used to roll to Little Caesars
Piece of pizza with Tanisha now I'm with a Boniqua
She finna blow at that
I got your dream girl, yeah, she actin' like a hoe at that
Throw her to me, I'ma throw that back
Top spot, I'm finna go at that (Straight up)

[Verse 3: Big Sean & Kanye West]
Hoe, you gotta move quick
World in my hands, I ain't gotta loose grip
I don't like loose pussy or loose lips
And I done did the impossible a few times, Tom Cruise shit
Hoe, and I ain't satisfied bein' on that top five list
I ain't satisfied until I'm on that all-time list
Til everything I spit is all timeless
My girl on that all fine list
My life a little luck, a lot of grind, bitch!
No ""maybe,"" hoe, I gotta make it
Fuck your nomination; man, fuck the world
I'm repopulatin', wrap my Rollie round my waist
Yeah, time's a-wastin'
Niggas want the comma-comma-combination
Long as I'm around, it's gon' be dot-dot-dot, a lot of waitin'
Got my pinky on her brain while I'm gettin' brain
Plottin' world domination, people ask me how to make it
I'm just like ""man, if you want the crown, bitch, you gotta take it""

I take a plan and then I back-to-back it

I take the work, flip it, acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition, hm, not a challenge
I lean, I move, I walk through in this bitch
Packed out, but I can count on my hands who I'ma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah, they paralegals
Barely 21, that's very legal
But they doing shit that's probably barely legal, aw, man
It's that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top five getting redirected
From here on out, it'll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino, like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham

Half of these niggas my mini-me's
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute, me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth, man, that shit like a gym to me, don't test the agility
Silly, silly, thinking that the negativity you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility, look
Okay, okay, okay, I'm on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway, away
Stay away, or your ass might get K.O., kay today
Man, that ""pew! pew!"" hit your ass from like way, a-ways, away

Fuck what you telling me, I sense the jealousy
I got telepathy, I got the recipe
I got the streets and I don’t got no felonies
Forward thinking, yeah my mind is ahead of me
Momma said it's gonna be whatever you let it be
It's some homies I grew up with that's dead to me
It's some niggas that I just met in debt to me
What's in common is they both pay respect to me
I get it my way from Friday to Friday
My girl is a mix of Aaliyah and Sade
I came a long way from that ""Marvin and Chardonnay""
I pull out the driveway like I’m in a car chase speeding!
And if my bitch cheat she know I’m leaving!
No text, no call boy
That bitch airplane mode, cold
No peacoat, no time to change clothes
Same clothes, love if you living by the same code
G-code, leave ho
Fuck it you dead to me, back to my destiny
Penthouse, birds eye view, that's a nest for me
I got my self out of debt
So when you see me, know you're somebody I'll never need

[Verse 1 : Big Sean]
Yeah, I got a brand new Benz
Crazy right, brand new Benz
Got less miles on it than I do friends
Remember when we laid at you and Paige’s crib
Was there so long I coulda paid rent
Remember when we couldn’t get shit?
Best thing bout being broke is you don’t spend shit
Remember that Christmas? We had a wish list
We couldn’t afford nothin' but we still get shit
Ironically those were the times I felt the richest
All those times that we spent by the pool girl
Was too broke to even take you to the zoo girl
Maybe its because I had you girl
Was thinking about when we went to London and Paris
And gave each other times that we cherished
Remember when you saw the Eiffel Tower
And you got so drunk threw up? Yup you were so embarrassed
See those are times I can’t let go, I can’t let go
Man I hate to see you single in the club looking for kisses and hugs
So you Sipping on XO til I snatch you up like “let’s go”

My bad for those long long nights, long nights when I left you in the sheets
Sorry for when you had to cry yourself to sleep
Tried to count on me and I made you count sheep
Sorry when you put your faith in me I was unfaithful, disgraceful, distasteful
Yeah I know you’re not supposed to hate cake and eat too
Crazy how these hoes always kept my plate full
What about the emails you hacked in?
I know we hate to live in the past-tense
It’s been weird since I went out west and did an album with No I.D
And ain’t came back since
Now we the best in the city, I rep for the city
That’s about the time that you left for the city
You and all your girls moved to NY
I shoulda’ known now how you watch Sex And The City
I know we ain’t close but, I gotta focus on blowing up
I know I promised that I’d be there, and really did I ever show up?
I know I wasn’t honest to ya girl
Almost broke every promise to ya girl
Brought problems to your world
And you said “how could you just lie to me? I thought you’d die for me?”
I was scared you’d find somebody who would treat you like you supposed to
You the type niggas get close to, get close to, and then propose to
And when Thanksgiving come around
I ain't tryna bring hoes through to momma
So it’s back to the drama
“No I don’t know that number”
“Why the hell you text it?”
Heartbreak hotel man, with no exit just checked in
Young and living reckless

Million-dollar calls you can't merge in, BasedGod how I got my curse lift
She gon' play her part so well, you thought that she rehearsed it
Don life worship
Holy temple, synagogue, tabernacle, churches

[Interlude: Big Sean]
Yeah (Hit-Boy)
Look

[Verse 9: Big Sean]
I can't even chill, I get active
Overdoin' everythin' my best and worst habit
Shit be impossible 'til it happens
I never thought I'd see Kobe go before Magic
That taught me first, no seconds to waste
Only waist I like is her legs wrapped around my face
Fuck you think she doin' over here? Watchin' Netflix?
Beard game, might just let it grow down to my necklace, uh
I don't hope for wins, I expect it, uh
Adrenaline in me like it got injected
My girl say I got communication issues, no, I don't
I just don't like sharin' all my problems more than the results
I bring the plan back to my team, tell 'em go wild
Godbody my physique and my profile
I did every single goal that I wrote down
Checked it off, it's old now
And that shit give me chills, fuck I gotta take yours?
I'm the originator, make it, then I make more
Written in stone, you can't forge
You ain't on my level even if we in the same buildin' on the same floor
Old boy black out
Dough boy cash out, payroll, contract maxed out
Cash kid, cash cow
Tapped in, I can't tap out
Bitch, keep thinkin' I'm sleepin' in
Tony on the monitor, I see your ass creepin' in
Lil' bitch, if it weren't for me, you wouldn't exist, you get the gist?
Fuck a cease and desist, they shootin' up seats and exits
Throwin' plays to my bros, I'm leadin' the league in assists
Hopscotch, blacktop, I ain't been skippin' a step since
Real estate, Zillow every day, bitch, I might just change my profession
Dodged so many rainy days, it changed my complexion
Hang up on your ass and say I lost the connection
I turned out to be the man that I manifested

[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go then)

[Verse 10: Sada Baby]
Hmm, fuck the bullshit
I ain't here to make no friends, can't get bool with me
Since an adolescent, I was ignorant, up in school trippin'
Pistol at my desk, I was sittin' up in school with it
Put your bitch hand in my corner pocket, play pool with it
She gon' eat the dick, both balls licked, and do it to me
Ain't go to college, I ain't want no pussy nigga roomin' with me
Still could've went to college, Sada ain't no fool, nigga
Every clip we got extended, yellow Perkies look like minions
Put Church's Chicken on your niggas, scrape them boys for half a biscuit
Know I like the burner, but I'll beat your ass, this shit personal, huh
Hit a nigga in his shit with this fifty or thirty, duh

[Interlude: Big Sean]
(Let's go, Royce)

[Verse 11: Royce da 5'9""]
Name a nigga out of the D as solid as me
I unlocked a lot of dollars, nigga, knowledge is key
I did it all without a college degree
I went from hottest signed artists, don dada, to G
Street lord, rock bottom, Godfather, and P
D-Boy, Rottweiler, Sean, Sada, and Tee
Standin' on the corner three days
Phone is on Motorola prepaid
Diadora or gold Ellesses
These are ordered from the older East Bays
She either rollin' with the owners or the lessees
A kind man knows a blind man holds grudges
A wise man knows a wise man knows nothin'
I thought I told you motherfuckers I ain't need a budget
I ride with them guys that society begrudges
We been thuggin' worldwide, got arenas buzzin'
We survived gettin' fronted by Ilena cousin
Before you could sell that Cole and Adele
Or go NFL, be Kobe or Kells
The plight of the rich is to throw you in jail
The fight has been fixed since the openin' bell
And you know who postin' your bail? Who promotin' your L?
Who be hopin' you fail? Nigga, Oprah and Gayle
Ignore the hate, show the world that we love the opps
Call Lyor great while they make rape Russell docs
Nah

[Interlude]
(Okay, yeah)
(Hit-Boy)
Yeah
(G. Ry got me)

[Verse 12: Eminem]
Bitch, you have never said a clever line ever
You murdering in the booth is the furthest thing from the truth
Rest assured, I'ma treat this roof like I'm peelin' off (What?)
The plastic on a pill bottle, I'm tearin' the ceilin' off, yeah
Ripping rappers like they were wrapped in Saran, bitch
And I'm strapped up with ammunition
And single-handedly takin' over the game like I had an actual hand missing
But I only need one to clap
Animal ambition
The only butt-fuckin' way that you're strapped is for cash
Wish you could slap in the damn clip in that motherfuckin' imaginary little handgun you're brandishin'
Bitch, if you pull up with the stick
It's a car with a manual transmission
The chances are low to none that I will overcome my bipolar one
Voodoo dolls, I'm just pokin' fun, pins to me are like loaded guns
When I'm holdin' one, if I'm just fiddlin' with it
This motherfucker discharges like me checkin' myself out of the fucking mental hospital
And I get off like an acquittal, I spit it, you critique it
It feels like I'm bein' belittled by midgets
It's like holding a nuke or a damn bazooka
And walkin' right up in the middle of a little kids' fuckin' pillow fight with it
You want smoke? I'm like hookah
Man, I remember back when I used to get jumped for my fucking Pumas
Run home and go fuck my room up
These streets will try to vacuum you up
That's why the avenue where I grew up was 8 Mile and Hoover (What?)
'Cause it sucked like a Roomba
But even if I would've went the indie route
I don't have any doubt
I would still get blown like it's windy out
Shoot 'til the clip is emptied out
This is the beginning of the ending, but I'll put another clip in and spit these rounds
If I dig deep down when I'm in my bag like Fendi
Who am I offending now?
Got so many fucking detractors, feels like I'm gettin' plowed
Had to put my money on a diet, I got too many pounds
You would think I'm turnin' pages the way that I'm flippin' paper
Middle fingers, them bitches get to wavin' like friendly neighbors
I'm talkin' loot like I'm rioting
Dick is so big, I can't fit the entire thing through a tire swing
I don't think it'd be logic for me to say that I'm retirin'
But I should say bye-bye, earthlings
'Cause I'm back on Uranus fuckin' up this ""Grindin'"" beat, yeah
I took the pain and learned how to put that shit into a song
You listen for flaws and strip it and try to pick it apart
So when I'm rippin', it's hard to tell whether if it is really because
Of how offensive I am, or just what a bitch that you are
Like I never had to get my clothes at fucking St. Vincent de Paul
Like I don't make sure every sentence and bar with a pencil is sharp, and I'm quick on the draw
Yeah, so when I pull it, surprise (Pull it, surprise), like Kendrick Lamar
You need to walk the Yellow Brick Road and find the chick with the dog
'Cause y'all are missing a heart
Plus your bitch is giving out brain like the Wizard of Oz
This shit is like sitting in the principal's office getting scolded for skipping
Y'all got detention tomorrow
I'm severe like Benzo withdrawal
Bitch, your skin's gonna crawl
I'm invincible, I've been through it all
Like I never thought about just ending it 'til I got pissed off and put a fist through the wall
My back was against
Now I rap like I'm possessed, that's nine-tenths of the law

You cried on my phone the whole night
That time he crossed the line yeah, yeah, yeah
(Oh I was there) I went to straighten his ass out
And you told me never mind yeah, yeah, yeah
The question isn't, ""Do he love ya?"" The question is, ""Do ya love yourself?""
You give the best advice to your friends and not take it for yourself
Remember when you used to come through and hit the Mario Kart
And you always picked the princess
I realized you was princess way back then
We the best thing that never happened, but

You been up at night, sleep deprivation
What's the hesitation? What's ya reservation?
You been trippin', trippin' with no destination
You need separation, you need recreation
Y'all been arguing every other day
Ya friends gotta step in and break it up like chill, chill, chill
It's no need to turn this into Kill Bill, look
Funny we ran into each other while we leaving
You walked in with a perm
And now yo' hair look like The Weeknd's
I know that you been needin' clarity
Don't mean to sit ya down and turn this into therapy
But you gave too much time to that boy charity, hear me

[Chorus]

And turn that nigga that you with right back into your friend, though

Uh-huh, oh, yeah, look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it's the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying ""Hi Britney"" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some XXX girls
Pussy get wet as an S-Curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like ""I got some hoes, hit me back""
Fuck it

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
We get ahead, yup, she give me head, damn right
You know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
With this crazy, crazy world
Thank God I'm with my girl
[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You be the momma, you be the daddy
Baby, we could play house, I'll change your addy
Or even change my palate and fuck with salad
Put me in the picture, let's change your avi, oh, oh, oh
Can't even stunt I was sprung from the jump
Never got head while flaming up the blunt
You were my first, I'm just saying
More folks should try it, it's crazy
Focus, selfish moments, on road, I done have my share
Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Oh I could let you down
When you trip, I'll take you anywhere, I take ya

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
To the one girl guys who claim they don't need more
Like my nigga Henry, he married at 24
I'm like why nigga, why?
You supposed to be with her longer than your ass been alive?
He like, ""ahhh""
Fuck it, we about to do therapy
Aye, at least when I hit the doctor I'm carefree with no plan b's
You probably never got tested and have that type of clarity
I'd rather live my life with that lifetime guarantee
But I'm down to hear the stories about what your hoes do
It’s probably more entertaining than me talking about my wife down in Whole Foods
Or how when I'm with her I feel whole too
Go on, keep living that life you niggas know you too old too
Fuck it, I started laughing and pretend like I ain't listen
Even though he on target with everything I've been missing
The closest thing I had to that came in at 4 AM and out at 8 for work
And I'm the reason we ain't make it work
That's what makes it worse
Damn

Oh I could let you down

I done seen this shit happen a hundred times on the regular
But I still crossed the line like I'm blind, damn
Voices in my head saying I could do better
(You always do the same shit)

[Verse]
This was supposed to be the last time, last hit
Last call, last feel, last trip, last run
That's what I always tell myself, huh, damn
This was supposed to be the last one, last two
Last flip, last you, last me, last night
Doing every single thing my parents warned me 'bout
(You're a fucking disappointment) 'Til I wore 'em out, shit

(Voices in my head saying that I could do better)

Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing

[Verse 1]
Stay focused
Don't let these niggas see your emotions
Stick to the notion, stay in motion
Remember soon as you stand still
So will everything else you notice
Make sure all your inner actions end with actions
If you stacking fronting and back in
Subtract if it isn't adding
Plus who hurt you don't let back in
Plan it out, yeah, tit for tat it
Extra pussy get distracted
Put that into what's worth having (boy)

Stick to the, plan, to the plan
Stick to the plan, bitch quit playing

[Verse 2]
Stay focused (stay focused)
Pay attention who you getting close with
Distance yourself from negative energy
Voices in my head, they say it's meant for me
I, I, I, you in my way, bitch it's no sympathy
I, I, I, been plotting this since elementary
I, I, I, no you need to buckle down
Have people asking where you at
And wondering why you never wanna come around
You know that effort gon' come around
Big face like Zordon
You bought the watch but can't afford the time
Even if you running out of breath
Weight of the world doing lots of reps
Time to get this generation
Last one and then the next two outta debt
And they gon' pay you back with respect
Just stick to the plan, still, we can chill
Back when I rocked the white and blue Grant Hills
I realized there's no dream that I can't fill
I manifested all while I'm the man still
(Bitch I'm the man)
[Verse 3]
Voices in my head attacking what I'm thinking
Bullet to the head might be the way to free it
If I leave my body I can free the spirits
Swear to God my death of fear just keep on shrinking
Wishing I could go back to the nineties
Back when I was dreaming
Me and my dog was on a mission like we Kel and Kenan
Early 2000s Detroit might as well been the hell with demons
Wondering when I started losing it, the losing grip
Feeling like I'm in the middle of the ocean
You either drown or canoe through it
Voices in my head said I'm used to it
Some help me to lose and some help me maneuv' through it
When I talk to myself I'm confused on who's who it
I know in life you either blow it or blew it
And at the end of life, it's gonna feel like you flew through it
I just hope by then I cut the voices in my head46Embed"

Man, I swear to God it get so deep though
That sometimes I  just gotta wake my ass up out my sleep though
And wonder what if all the shit I reaped then got repoed
And the girl I gave it all up for ain't love me for me though
See, I got a stack of problems that could use a fucking steamroll
Got off in the game, don't need no cheat code
As long as I know the G code
Being paranoid done turned me to a creep
You ain't got that metal on your side
Police gon' work it like Magneto if they need to, it get deep
Deep, deeper than telekinesis
Deeper than your sister dying and you're telling your nieces
The deeper it gets, boy, the pressure increases
But pressure make diamonds
And my name is Sean cause I shine, it's self explanatory
I architect the flow, rapping all of these stories on stories
You know the story
If my back against the ropes, then I'll finish Stone Cold it
My opponent probably praying for postponement
You fuck with the best rapper, don't even know it

Jail time, a slap on the wrist
Cut your head off, get it mailed out, stamp on your lips
You can tell I'm grinding by my wrist
Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist
Well, tell them I'll be waiting in suspense
I got some miles on me, but it's cool cause I never give an inch
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say
Cause this shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say
That shit enough times like somebody rewind me
Like shit is deeper than rap, I cannot say that shit enough times
I feel like Sean, don't get enough shine
Is it because he ain't got the tattoos? He ain't throwing up signs
Well, let me throw up mine
And also let me show this vision of mine
Fuck the finish line, just finish your lines
And if getting your point across crosses the line
Some of the time then cross it with pride
That's real, my nigga, remember that
And it ain't about if they remember you, they remember rap
So just spit it back and hope somebody diggin' that

That you don't need a master's just to be a masterpiece

So I'ma call my favorite girl and she gon' bring that ass for me
And as for me, I'ma text the room number right now

On a roll more than a roller coaster

Heaven on earth, every night is paradise
I pray I didn't die or overdose, never that
I kept it a hundred, never change, not even for five 20s
Still smokin' at 5:20 like it's 4:20
On a quest for more money, more hungry
Just got my fortune read, she said it's more comin'
Yeah I got the force but never force nothin'
Do it for the love, I'm Forrest Gumpin'
In my city I'm Warren Buffett
I mean business, the shirt is tucked in
The gun's tungsten, fuck it, I'm who not to fuck with

Only knock the door if you're dying
I wish I could stay in here forever (I love it)
You the only reason me and your mama ain't together (lil bitch)

Women are from Venus, caught in love playing tennis
Some girls are the Lebron James of playing mind games
And switch their home team up every single time their mind change

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Don't play no games with hoes, I play Nintendo DS, nigga
And pray I don't see the end of my paper like P.S nigga
But damn in high school you had the fattest ass
And now we out of high school, you got a fatter ass
Swear I was just up on your Instagram a day or two ago
Seen your ass in deja vu, that shit was deja vu I know
Reminiscing on the one time we smashed in the back of the whip
And you gave me that head
I swear to God that was the best night of my life
I can't even sit here frontin', lie and pretend
Dancing with your titties out
I know at first it was a little bit embarrassing yeah
But 5 minutes later you on my lap
And we just kickin' it like we're the only ones here
You're telling me how you went down South for school
Down near TSU
But you know business majors
You can't even get a job when you're comin' right out of the school
Told her check the Valley, seems like out there they be hiring
In L.A where all the girls that look like you are aspiring
A new scenery might just be inspiring
She said ""Pshh, man everything ain't for everybody, shit I'm good""

A little change but I ain't change up
A little fame but I ain't famous

She drop it for me, pussy pop it for me, take it to the top
Spending extra time when she ain't got it, on me
Then she turned around said
""I'm so proud, seems like everywhere I'm hearin' ya
Seems like yesterday you freestyled in the cafeteria
Tell me how it happened? Know this ain't the place to ask""
When she said that shit I had a flashback, back to the past
Man '07, LAX, first time in the baggage claim
Don C picked me up off the curb, my bags in hand
Was nervous as shit, knew I was meeting up with Ye
And we riding through the hills swerve, swervin' and shit
Seeing the houses on the hills like I'm deserving this shit
Oh boy I'm worth it yeah it's time to put the work in this shit
Oh that was back before I had the G.O.O.D. imprint
Hit the studio with Kanye, that shit was intense
And he said ""Boy you got it, boy you is a prophet""
Signed me, got a profit
Few years later yeah we on and poppin'
And I got a crib off in the same hills we used to drive in
Brr Brr, call up Don C he was the first to know about it
Almost went to TSU with Alesha then I dropped it
Fuck it, I guess everything ain't for everybody
Oh boy, swerve

It's gon' take more than that to set it right though
Cause, you so, fuckin', outta, line
For ever, letting, them taste what's mine
Taste what's mine, taste what's mine
You so, fuckin', outta, line

[Verse 1]
Feel like you owe me checks, owe me time, owe me sex
Long nights, no reply, I got no regrets
You disrespect, disrespect, only time I seen you now's on the internet
Just to see if it's somebody else that you tied to
I hit you back when I decide to, you got my tattoo, we was tribal
Then you left and we turned rivals, now you back it's our revival
They don't make you feel like I do, they didn't make you perform for me
You was my American Idol how you rocked the mic
Man, we went from long text, now they shorter than a haiku
Seems like all you got is hate for me
All you ever did was take from me
Cause you know you got that walk from me
How you dress and how you talk from me, yeah
Let's not ever disrespect what I meant to ya
It took us being over to see all I did for ya, damn

All that shit you told me, I believed
The smile on your face the only thing I can't read
Left and now you back inside my life

I'm just trying to let the past pass
Ain't no future in that, yeah
I stay 100 like my dash, yeah
Have you cummin' faster than The Flash, yeah
Is it all mine, all mine? You know me, I had to ask
Can I hit it like I crash? Sipping pinot by the glass, glass
Honestly, I had to take the time to let my ego go
Realized that that held us back and back's not where we need to go
This don't replace what you did to me
This don't replace what I did to you
Sometimes it ain't about what we did or didn't do
It's about what we getting through
Look, I'm not tryna play the blame game
Point the fingers while we skip the point
Knowing that we both want the same thing
Riding for each other even if we gotta change lanes
If we don't work it out, shame shame
I can't touch these hoes I can't trust, I don't wanna have a fake us

But all that shit you told me, I believed

Getting hurt every time I'm close to you

Okay I know what it feel like to be young and single
You know the life when your pockets got a bunch of singles
You know taking double shots, saying fuck a single
You know, hardly getting sleep but it' the fuckin' dream though
Look, I know what it feel like to think you found the one
Told mom that so many times that I'm sounding dumb
Cause she started to mix Ashley up with Tanesha
And saying ""Hi Britney"" when I'm on the phone with Lisa
Fuck it, I got some new hoes, I mean some xxx girls
Pussy get wet as an s-curl
Then I started thinkin' 'bout my ex-ex-ex girl
And how it was the worst times but she was the best girl
You know, good girl, bad time, right place, wrong mind
Got my mind right, hit her back, brrr, the wrong line
(The number you dialed has been disconnected)
Man, but before I started feeling bad
My nigga text me like, ""I got some hoes, hit me back,"" fuck it

Oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind

You kiss my lips

I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

Flying out of town like baby don't mind my player
Sleepy arguments via texts while I buy my beer
And the air so tired I forget to recline my chair
Picture you in my head, a souvenir by my legs
Some scuba gear for the bed, we do it 'cause Simon says
Ain't a single living thing that likes living single
We good over here, that's all that we know
[Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, oh I could
Let you down
I don't know why
You keep my mind
Racing again
You kiss my lips
When you trip
I'll take you anywhere
I'll take you

[Post-Chorus: Jeremih & Chance the Rapper]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kinda world
I'm glad I got my girl
[Verse 3: Smino]
Pink caddy, Pepto-Bismobile
Ting named Cali, that ass on sunset hill
A beautiful view, unusual, I'm hooked on the real
And you would be too, I'm pookie bout that coochie, for real
Okay cool, I guess I love the way you
Nourish the soul, you know that ass look like a fuckin' grapefruit
Hitting them push-ups so when I'm up in that what's up, what's up you get whooped up
Arch that thing like where I'm from, been on my brain, miss serotonin
Living la vida with my Lavita, feel like Ceddy
Liberate your limbs eliminate your limits, let me
You feel just like lemonade on ice when I'm all sweaty
She said, ""Smino, boy I get it all ready""
[Post-Chorus: Jeremih]
Yeah, let's get ahead, yup
We get ahead, that's right
I know it ain't right if she ain't by my side
In this crazy kind of world
I'm glad I've got my girl

Got her friends tryna fuck me and her man's tryna rob me
And she won't leave me alone, I tell the trick to get a hobby

With a billion dollar pussy
Every time I cum, I swear to God I feel like I be rich
Yeah, tryna get that hotel money
But you know them crackers ain't gonna let you get the Ritz

I'ma just keep countin'

[Hook]
I always got a grip, I never slip, I never panic
Got my Rolex set Pacific, while I fly through the Atlantic
And just like a know-it-all, I always got the upper hand
And if I listen to you bitches I would still be on the campus
But instead I'm in The Standard, with a girl who got some standards
Gettin' head in the Jacuzzi and she claim she from Los Angeles
But she ain't come up for air one time, I swear she from Atlantis

[Verse 1]
It's so fuckin' hard to have manners since I bought a manor
I never take off, I just take off her panties
To partially nominated, yeah, yeah nigga you know me
Hop on a song and kill with niggas, who just won all the trophies
Bitch I ain't playin' no more like D. Rose or Kobe, it's Kobe the beef and it's shrimp ravioli
Sean Don, you know me, my cash homophobic, I swear it's so straight
Then I double it up like I cloned it!
My homie called me like ""Sean Don, look
You know I got a girl, like you, so my nigga this one's off the books
But could you hook me up with Ariana Grande?""
Seems like niggas just call me for the hook-up or to get up off the hook
I'm back in this bitch like I'm parallel parkin' (swerve swerve)
Get hit with that 18, what's that? Bitch it's two 9's, that's parallel sparkin'
I look up to the stars and God damnit I swear I can hear them shits talkin'
To you they the stars but to me they a target
She said that I'm fine and I say that I'm gorgeous
I'm livin' so lawless, I promise
We just landed, Bora Bora
Champagne, I pour, I pour
Model girls, old Kimora
Fuck more or less, it's more or more
I'm stackin' paper, safe to safe, drawer to drawer, bank to bank, floor to floor
Touch a dollar and them killas be door to door to door to door to door to door
Face to face, Hennessy, case to case
Day to day, I paper chase, amazin' grace
I've been plottin' since '86, and I was born in '88
So what the fuck that make me?
A young visionary
My secretary finna be a millionare
Imma call her military
Finally Famous militarian, I rep that, that
'Til I hit the cemetery
And I'm way too skinny for jail, ho
So I gotta stay rich enough just for the bail, ho
I'm collectin' this change like I live in a well
Heaven on Earth, I could get it through Hell
Bitch, we did it and did it ourselves
So now I'm presidential, my life, presidential, my wife
Residential, the lake, presidential estates
Like my homie Tone said, I could talk about my watch all day
But that's a fuckin' presidential debate
Man shout out to SAYITAINTTONE and Jay John

Man, tryna sit and build
You got every girl that's in Detroit that's hot tryna come chill
Cause I just lost my nigga Doe B and a fuckin' Uncle Phil

Hangin' from my family tree, I'm a nuisance, millionaire

Do or die
Look, all I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
And when you feel something you can't see
But you know it's meant to be
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me yeah
Bigger than me, bigger than me
When the whole family depend on you to eat
And at night you can't sleep
You gon' realize that this is bigger than me

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Get it, get it, get it
I pray that you get it even if I can't get it with cha
I pray to God you never let the little things in life distract you from the bigger picture
Everybody in the city to me like a distant cousin, brother, little sister
I see myself in the young ones
When I look in their eyes it feel like a mirror
Corleone all on my own (Don)
Cartier all on my arm
All I hear is sirens  and car alarms
Niggas going to war with no armor on
First time I seen a dead body I was 14
And I felt the pressure
Like if I don't get it, I might end up next to him
I'ma take the dice and I'ma roll a 7
Seven, seven, seven, 7-11 it's 911 getting called around
The hood America's lost and found
Where niggas get lost and never found
All I ever wanted was to turn these Gs into Ms and a Mercedes key
Got it and I still felt incomplete
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me
All I wanna do is make the city proud, yeah
Wishing all the OGs could see me now, now, yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
Ohhh ya ya yeah
You gon' realize that this was bigger than me

[Bridge: Starrah]
Used to want that foreign
Got that foreign, now it's boring
Started touring
Swear to God that's when I realized this shit was bigger than me
Flex on niggas with a Rollie
Got that Rollie with the shine
But lost my time
That's when I realized this shit was bigger than me

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I seen people in the same place 10 years later
Man that shit pathetic
God talking to me telepathic like it only happen if you let it
I can't spend my whole life looking at the same ceiling fan
When I feel like I ain't got no ceilings man
If I ain't special why I feel it then?
I gotta get on the road
I gotta be the one chose
I gotta come back and tell the greatest story they never told
This must be the feeling that you get when you know you close
And you know it's a way in even when the doors are closed
And realize this shit is bigger than me yeah
[Chorus: Big Sean & Flint Chozen Choir]
Bigger than me
When the whole town on their feet
And they all just waiting on you to speak
That's when you realize that this is bigger than me

[Myra Anderson:] Well no matter what, I'm proud of you. Even when you do stupid things that I have warned you about. You must get that from your daddy. I'm just kidding, you know I love you. You listening?
[Big Sean:] Yeah yeah, I'm listening. I love you too
[Myra Anderson:] In a way I feel like I'm living through you. Sometimes it feels like I got another chance at everything
[Big Sean:] Man that's deep you feel like that. I kinda feel the same way though sometimes
[Myra Anderson:] Yeah
[Big Sean:] With all the work that's goin' on I feel like this is like my second time doin' it so I know that sound crazy but, you know I just I don't know why I always imagine myself as like someone who failed at everything he ever did at life you know and I got to the end of life and just regretted it all and somehow, this is my chance to go back and get it all right. And when I wake up, with that mindset, you know, it completely changes my hunger, how I approach the whole day.

You was a millionaire but your niggas is still at home
Damn, nigga, you did it, but damn it you did it wrong
You got time for that gig, but not time for the phone
Got it right with your ends, but fucked it up with your friends
I seen your ass up on TV,  touched up on them twins
You don't know about hard times, you clutched up in that Benz
Get tired of fuckin' hoes then get to fuckin' their friends, whoa
Niggas want handouts, and I only got two
Now I'm on the phone talkin' to my mom like I only got you
Gettin' dressed up for court, that's a law suit
Ain't wearin' V necks, but niggas ask what happened to the crew
Now I'm in court for some shit I didn't do
Cause of my nigga, knowin' my career could've been through
So when it's time to travel management say I only need two
Listenin' to them when I'm the one that makes the rules
I'm just a victim of the life though that I ain't tryna lose
This the dream, I had a wake up call and missed snooze
Lately, though my family been too happy
I just turned my mama hooptie to a new Caddy
People thinkin' I'm rich and I wish they knew that
I been signed for four years and I'm just able to do that
Worry 'bout my next Rolex time piece
My nigga Tone worry 'bout our sis, Shanice
We supposed to be the role models
No wonder why she wanna smoke weed and skip college

Okay, you win some, lose some, break some, bruise some
Life could be a test, multiple choice, choose some
Choose one, stick with it, man, prove some
Sometimes the best teachers is ourselves goin' through somethin'
Real life will teach your ass way fucking fast
I always thought my last girl was supposed to be my last
I got four aunties, two uncles, one dad
One mom, two brothers, and 200 niggas mad
And it's only one me, divide it and do the math
I'm the one that dropped out, got no time for the class
How am I supposed to have time for everyone I just said?
I don't even have time for everything in my head
On my way to see Kim and Ye both tie the knot
Wishin' me and you were no strings attached, but were nots
Man thats drama, drama drama
So deep that call each others mamas' mamas
We need a break I mean comma, comma comma
I'm tryin, homie
But she always picks the wrong time like phones dyin' on me
In the bed cryin' on me, talkin' lyin' on me
It sucks to hit the internet and see you're lyin' on me

See, the mind is a fucking trickster
It can fuck you 'round, but your heart will never lie to you
And that’s why people love you, Sean
Because you talk to them from the heart
(Thanks, dad)
That’s why you're magical, Sean
It’s no mistake that you’re where you are right now
You speaking that from your brain, but they hear you from your heart
Because people can see your bullshit
And I know I’m talking a lot of shit
(No, you’re not)
But I want you to hear that
Because I’m a great motherfucker, man

G. Ry got me
Look

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend, block love me with a deep reverence
I was birthed in a C-section
Hella cops and police presence
We got opps so we keep weapons, we on y'all block while y'all eat breakfast
A lot of shots, we broke street records
Watch how you talk, I got reflexes, watchin' your cheap necklace
Then we slide out the East exit
But every time we get to fuckin' niggas up, TMZ catch it
Y'all still learnin' street lessons?
From the mastermind, first you master grind, then your team catch it
This time it’s for the money, I don't need credit
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it, look

[Chorus: Nipsey Hussle, Big Sean & Both]
Fuck rap, I'm a street legend
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it
Block love me with a deep reverence (Yeah, woah)
And I'm the don 'cause the streets said it (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
And I got pressure on me
Seven days a week, it's game seven on me
Life'll test you out, you live through that, that's testimony
Givin' them hell, but how in the hell I got all these blessings on me?
Most of the girls I know addicted to social media
All the time they put in, they could've wrote encyclopedias
Mama said it only takes one time to fuck up your whole Wikipedia
And as your son, I can see the type of light that you see me in
After what happened to Nipsey, I reached out to Kendrick
It wasn't even no real issues there to begin with
Lack of communication and wrong information
From people fueled by their ego, it's like mixin' flames with diesel
Energy crazy, I realized that it's a two-way street
What's comin' is goin', if it don't give you more, it drains you
Should be a billionaire based on the time off I'm not takin'
Probably why this shit with me get crazy and we lost a baby
And everybody around me think I'm the one
But we all just one of ones, and I'm walkin' out the crib
They ask me where I'm goin', I told them, ""I'm going on another ten-year run""
Niggas is bangin' over blocks that they don't own, thinkin' that's home
Boy, you think that's where you from? You don't really know where you from
You don't how deep your roots is or what your ancestors had done
So, God bless all of the sons and daughters
Who knew they history so they knew where to take it farther
And all the ones that stuck with me like good barbers
Lookin' at my life story, God's a good author
Never was the loudest in the room, we move like ninjas
And if it cost your peace of mind, it might be too expensive
So I can't give you everything that you want from me for free though
Get you one shot in life, you might not be able to reload
So advanced, I need all my advances
Bro hit me up for cash like we didn't have the same chances
My dad hit me up like, ""Why I don't live in a mansion?""
I'm tryna focus, but baby girl keep holdin' my mind for ransom
And that ain't how it supposed to be, this man Hov got to a B
And his name Shawn too, I almost felt like it was me
Damn, I realized all my setbacks were inside of me
In high school, I learned chemistry, biology
But not how to cope with anxiety
Or how I could feel like I'm by myself on an island
With depression on all sides of me (Damn)
With a Glock seventeen right on the side of me (Hol' up)
Look, I ain't think I had the thought of suicide in me
Until life showed me all these different sides of me
Too many times I thought the reaper was outside for me (Ooh)
And how the fuck it's people that never met me that hate me?
I wonder if they understand that I meditate daily
And feel like my life purpose is to give inspiration
Despite the hit songs that there's just no escapin'
That I take care of my family and beat the odds that were deadly
You hate that, that just reflects your lack of succession, bless 'em
If it ain't Nipsey blue, it's Detroit blue
This that Detroit 2, I'm bringin' it back to my hood like d-boys do
Gone (Gone)
[Outro: Nipsey Hussle & Comic J Will]
So, the collaboration though, with Nipsey and who?
Aw man, I'd probably say Payroll, eh, or Tee Grizzley

I should have realized it was inside
So lately I been trying to get what's inside outside
So many people wanna see my insides outside
I'm from that city four hours east of Southside
Where everyone outside, but don't fuck with no outsiders
Going up, with the ones I hold it down with
Whole city got my back on some photobomb shit
Whole city blowing up on some old Saddam shit
Before this, I was the one hoes tried to go to prom with

You know, take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light

Ye found a pro, I guess I'm profound in this bitch
My dad from Louisiana, man the smallest town
Where if they know you're brown, they might hold you down and even hose you down, man
Since I'm his son, I feel like I gotta stunt hard
I took the hand that they gave me and played the Donald Trump card
And realized counting money never feel as good as counting blessings
And a loaded mind is more dangerous than a loaded weapon

[Refrain: Big Sean]
So when they take the fame, take the crib, take our cars
Now we gotta take the train, and hood niggas takin' chains
Slavemaster take our names, 5-0 take the shot
And young souls take the blame, man but they can't take away
The light

[Chorus: Jeremih & Big Sean]
No matter how much they gon' shade you
No, man they can't fuck with the light
They can't stop the shine
No, man they can't fuck with the light
Hell nah, the boy's that bright
Even if you take away my life, you can't take the light
No matter how much they gon' shade you
[Outro: Jeremih]
Don't let them take away your soul
No, no (No, no)
Don't let them take away what makes you whole19Embed"

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
I know I'mma get it, I just don't know how
Heart up on the stage, body in the crowd
Parents always tried to keep me home
But I can't get paid from the crib, so I'll be gone 'til we on
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
So me and my niggas real life'd it, every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Said I'mma cash my check and hit some ass today
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday""
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it""
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, ""Let's do it""
[Interlude: Kanye West and DJ Mo Beatz]
When I heard the songs he was doing
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Just to think, last night I was in Venice hugging bitches
Thanking God Almighty, condoms were invented
Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
Man. who claim she never did it (Yeah right)
But under these conditions, she was with it
Then I hopped up on that red eye when I finished
I been gone for five hours, fuck, my head still spinning
Fucked the hotel up, shit she probably still in it
Getting rest that I be missing
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot, now I'm running late for sound check
And I heard the line's already to the lot, walking out the station
And that's around the time that I got stopped, by this shorty tryna rhyme
Manager said we ain't got time, but time to time
You gotta make time when it's time for karma to come back around
I say ""Aye dawg, What you got?"", ""Aw dawg, Big Sean, thanks a lot
Um, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Tryna follow me get in a maze, Leave you minute maid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
So I give him my email on a fly
And if his song's good I'll reply
[Interlude: Trick Trick and Shorty]
Trick Trick: Hello
Shorty: Ay nigga, Ay trick, where you at nigga
Trick Trick: Ay what up, whats good, whats up man?
Shorty: Ay bro, ay nigga I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg
Trick: What!
Shorty: Bro, haha, I just rapped for this nigga Big Sean dawg, aye
Trick: Oh hell naw, what?
Shorty: Hey I ran into this nigga, but aye he cool as hell man

Shorty: Bet, He short as hell though
Both: Hahahaha
Shorty: But that nigga was cool though man
Trick: Alright!
Shorty: Man just like how he spit a hundred bars, I spit like two hundred bars

[Outro 1: Big Sean]
Tell me what you know about dreams, what you know about having faith
In something you can't see, tell me how much do you believe
What you know about feeling something, that you can't even touch
What you know bout smelling something, that you can't even breathe
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
All the faith that you had, just ain't all the faith that you need
All the faith that I have, just ain't all the faith that I need
I'm sorry
[Outro 2: Mama Myra]
I know you're not my child talking like that. Focus on shifting this negative energy, into something positive. And the easiest way to do that, is to be grateful for all the things that you do have, for your health, for your family, your friends, all the people that care about you. You've got food to eat, you've got a place to stay. Ugh you know, let's feel good, let's get happy, boi! haha42Embed"

Sean, it's good to be home, isn't it?
I see the skyscrapers in the back, this shit is official

[Verse 1]
I got a lot on my mind, I got more in my face
If I ain't going to get it that day is going to waste
I'm tryna move in my safe like the safe was a safehouse
I ain't going out to eat but these hoes stay on the stakeout
And you know it's official when I go bringing that BAPE out
I'm thumbing through the magazines like ""This the girl Imma take out""
Imagine stuck in the D and you tryna find a way-way out
And yeah, your music been bumping and you just waiting to break out
And I've been waiting all god damn year, oh yeah
I can tell that it's near but near ain't here
Man, them bills is here right now
I guess you shine brightest when the lights down like now
And then they say it happened for me overnight, shit, yeah, I guess
I guess it took ten years for me to be an overnight success
What you know 'bout living check to check to living check to check to check to check?
First place, no neck and neck
Two girls is breast to breast to breast to breast
Blowing smoke but I'm a breath of fresh air
Yes, and I'm doing extra numbers like I'm Chinese
Taking double shots like Siamese
I'm from where crime breeds, her titties out like ""Sign these""
I knew I lived this life back when I was young and used to climb trees
I should've known back then I wasn't gon' stop
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
I said, ""I should've known back then, man, that I wasn't gon' stop""
Cause even then I was infatuated with just sitting at the top
[Chorus]
And I don't owe nobody in the world no favors
I started from the basement made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on
Said, ""I don't owe nobody in the world no favors""
I started from the basement made it to the skyscrapers
I'm a successful nigga, I got shit going on
I'm a successful Don, I got shit going on

[Verse 2]
Bitch, watch how you speak to me
I've been working all week and I know I need ZZZZs
Tryna get paid repeatedly
Jamaica or Cancun, now that's where I need to be
Credit card used to be EBT, in the D though that's D-EBT
I've been thinking about becoming a cop
So I can murk some niggas one by one off legally
I talk that real shit, but that's why they loving it
One time for the city, treating it like it's the mothership
Was talking to my dad though on some other shit
He like ""man, slow down with the girls you're fucking with
If they ain't a quarter back, there's no point of rushing it
Don't make the same mistakes I made with your mother""
But that's on some other shit, look
I'm into risk and taking it
I'm into making it then get back to making like I ain't made it yet
This the rehab for a workaholic, I been thinking bout shaking it
I done had a Rolex longer than I had relationships, I'm embarrassed to say that shit
But I've been working on myself and that's the most important work
Even if you don't get paid for it
Shit, call me the greatest
Don't call up no favours, I call up my saviour
Like thank you God, look at all we created
I started rapping Biggie Smalls in the basement
And now we headed to the tallest skyscrapers61Embed"

You know my favorite time to come through for you is the clutch
Last second, what a rush (Rush, rush), look
I'm the type to talk to the stars (I look up), straight up
These ain't tattoos, these are scars
My young dogs will tear you and the witnesses apart (Straight up)
They care 'bout starving more than they do 'bout a charge (Woah, woah, woah)
Me, I can't break a commitment (No)
I done seen people fuck up the whole team 'cause they couldn't play they position (Play your position)
Talking 'bout they didn't mean it, bitch, you know the road to hell was paved with good intentions
I see myself in my nemesis (See)
I contemplated forgiveness (No), I think I lost all my innocence (Yeah)
Ho, my life depend on this, this ain't no simple sucker shit (Woah)

I was raised by the wolves (Wolves), paid all my dues (Dues)
Always in the game and never played by the rules (Rules)
Tried to make me leave (Leave), fell down to my knees (Knees)
Picked myself up and turned my back to the breeze, oh-ohh
Spent a milli' on a Mille, mama look at me (Ooh)
With all these diamond chokers, man, it's gettin' hard to breathe
Thought that you were family, cut some branches off my tree (Wow)
But if you in my circle, know I'll always be around ('Round)
Don't let me down (Down)

I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
Dealt with real life shit, manned up and got through it
I'm a real D-Boy, take a look up in my face
Never did real estate, and still put you in your place
I don't trust dog hoes, dog hoes got fleas
From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
Every time I spit a verse, my city like ""Preach!""
Niggas thought I got evicted how my shit up in the streets
B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast
Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet
Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speak in Trapanese
If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back
Back on my feet, that's just how I be
I be out of town repping valid as an absentee
Lord, jeeze, jealous motherfuckers trying to absent me
Fuck these niggas up, now it's absent teeth
Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the Playoffs bitch
I'm even working half days on my day off bitch
Say it's gon kill me fuck it, I work graveyard shifts
'Long as that weed and money chilling in the pile

Can do anything in the world except not do it
Bought my fam new land, six star crib
Momma feeling like she Jewish, I'm the motherfucking truest
Yeah I talk about my mom, but shoutout to my dad
Would drive me to school every single chance he had
Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
And gave me the talks that made me to a man
Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
Coming from Detroit where everybody say ""what up doe?""
Horror movie shit, cause everybody there cut throat
Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though
Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
And grandma sad when she saw my commercial
""Stop having people at your shows that wasn't at rehearsals""
I’m tryna to get a office at the Empire State
To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home
Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state
Prayin' that I won't be late
When it's all finished at the endin', after all bottles spillin'
Throttle gripping, models switching, chin chilling in my villa
Fucking like I tryna populate a village, I'm replenished
I didn't do it just for the money, man, for the feeling

I woke up working like I'm Mexican
That mean I work from 10 to 10
Then 10 to 10, then 10 again
Nightmares of losing everything boost my adrenaline

[Verse 1]
All this bread can’t be too good for my cholesterol
Don’t come round talking loudly, fucking up my repertoire, dawg
I can’t lie bruh, lately I’ve been stressing heavily
I'm sipping, popping, smoking on whatever take the pressure off
You bitch you, FF Imperial
'Til my burial, dodging every bullet and venereal
Anti-fuckboy material, 'til I’m dead, I’m living proof
If you focus on what’s in front of ya and not what’s in the peripheral
It’s gone, word? Boy I seen drama on drama
Drama on drama, over comma on comma
I’m bringing home dead prez, my house done feel like it's haunted
I put the city on my back, right along with my garments
Went to sleep, snoring

Still it’s been depressed so long, I can’t even tell depression here

And we might take a trip to Jamaica, Montego

[Verse 1]
I waited my whole life to be the man of the hour, I really can't lie
I was the man when I started, I'll be the man when I die
Man, these hoes take your money and I take they virginity
I'm high, I split an O in half and now it's a parenthesis
Crazier than crazy, ape shit, retardedly stupid
I put that weed in the air and pass it, yep, that's alley-oopin
Okay now, oh that's yo' girl? Well, I don't give a mass of two shits
Okay, I'm west side, west side 'til I'm died and underneath them tulips
You bordo like Enrique, I'm too paid, I'm three-paid
I'm looking like I'ma sweep stakes but I treat your girl like a cheap skate
'Cause I need a crib, a big estate, I need a boat and that need a lake
I need some salmon that need a plate, that need a chef so I feed my safe
My crew is who I'd be widdity-wid it, Rosé, I sippity-sip it
I'm Quagmire, I fuck hoes, my cashflow, I giggity-get it
Oh, boy, I'm cock-a-mamian, the most zaniest, insaniant
Pulling up in Merced-iance (Ballin'), rolling up like I'm Damian (Marley)
I love girls that's Arabian, Albanian, Caucasian
I ride around gettin' cranium 'cause my dick is hard as titanium
Oh, boy, you had your chance and blew it (You blew it)
Stand aside and watch a real nigga do it, bitch
[Pre-Chorus]
I do it, do it
I do it, boy

I feel like the world mine
Just bow down, the world mine

The one and only in this mothafucka (What?)
Niggas staring like we the only one in this mothafucka (Do it)
How could you not know we in this mothafucka? (Boy)
I got my haters looking lonely in this mothafucka
Woah (Woah), I'm sipping on whatever I get handed
Throwing house parties so crazy that my crib look like a campus
Play your cards right and I could blow you up, nah, I ain't gambit
Shit, I'm wasted-wasted, this looks like a job for Captain Planet
Nah-nah, good lordy, whoadie, I just took more shots than Kobe
The realest niggas is reppin', the baddest bitches promoting
She put that thong on my groin-groin and then it go boing (Boing)
Got my fronter on her bumper, does it look like she towing?
I hustle hard like I'm finna lose the crib
And party hard like I'm finna do it big
All I ever do is big (So what?)
So all she wanna do is Big
Girl, what your name is? I really can’t remember
And Tone breaking tree down, somebody yell out timber
I'm up, up in them Kush clouds, lighting up like I'm Zeus (Ooh)
Bitch, stand back, watch how a real nigga do it

Whodie holdie slowly back yo bitch ass up, you over close
I overflow all over hoes, my niggas is over hype
Shooting up your Phantom
Now they call your shit the Holy Ghost
Mercy, Lord would you please have mercy
And protect me from the hoes
That when life ain’t sweet, they gon' desert me
Shut the fuck up and stand up when you see me
Like I'm the verdict
That's respect, now I got your wifey
And you back to using that Jergens
Hurting, sipping, spilling
Tipping, for my niggas who done passed way
Charge your ass a ""fuck you"" fee
And make you pay your tax today
I'm on a secluded island, swear it feel like Cast Away
Put that money in my shooter hands, and tell him blast away
I feel like getting paper is my destiny
'Til I rest in peace, get money recipe
Told my mom ""Get what you want
Then just leave the rest to me""
Ain't no motherfucking rest for me

Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Diamond rings, hundred chains, Slick Rick the ruler
I got cars, cribs all in my neck
Got them M's all in that bank
Griff, Blake all in that paint
Stacking bread, come watch me plank
Pray to never dying broke
Getting cases by the boat, we ain't shopping, buy the store
Shorty snorkel for that crab, eating lobster on my dinner plate
Stacking all this money homie, tryna see that ceiling break
Mula ain't everything homie, it's the only thing
Came from a hall of piss, straight to the hall of fame
Talk money, we got it, fuck boy, shoot your stylist
Eating good, I ain't brolic, I'm just chasing them commas
My niggas ride that five, and my bitch a ten
Got that China white, call it Jeremy Lin
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
My chain, a fridge, deep freezer, and a cooler

[Verse 1 : Big Sean]
Bitch I'm sexy as fuck, you ain't even gotta tell me
I ride around to Pac, I fuck my girl to R. Kelly
I tell her make me a sandwich, no PP & Jelly
She look back like ""Goddamn, what you think this? A deli?""
I'm screaming ""Hell yeah trick, Hell yeah ho""
That shit make her love me more, and she know I love her too
She know I been to hell and through, I need what Reverends do
Power of the revenue got me a 2 to 10 and a 10 to 2
I gotta shine boy I be a star, on fire that's a meteor
So I'm either or on TV with a Rita Ora set your DVR
Stacking money face to face what that mean CPR
Everyday the day date, gangbang major pain
D-Town I ride around me and my dog like Charlie Brown
Just trying to get that white money you know, countin' cake and KK's
On a day to day base, then vacay for eight days
You know muthafuck taking a vacation
Put palm trees up in my house and have a stay-cation
Getting paid while I'm chilling that's a paid-cation
Full glass of champagne, Oh no, you can't taste it

[Chorus]
I seen cars (switch up)
Seen Hoes (switch up)
Seen Money all switch up
When the days get dimmer
Who gone leave you there and who gon leave with ya

Bought a Cadillac, now I’m Cadillac Com
She ride alright, when I'm riding right, Put Cadillac on that lawn
Might even let her meet Ye, might even let her meet Sean
Might even let her meet Push, she never meet my Mom
Chi Town is my town, I ride around like I'm lying down
Southside my eyes down, I'm the shit y'all fly around(Oww)
I’m in my mode today, sayin what the fuck I’m ‘posed to say
Moving making money, got them trashbags back
Smoke Chibahs with leaders, Pussy sweet and I'll eat her
Got strippers and divas, plus some cougars and cheetahs
Oh you with GOOD, put me on like Bonita
I said ease up, ease up, ease up
Ain’t nobody fucking with my clique

All I care bouts my crew, my family and women
Except these women that’s hoing, and these hoes that be stealing
Trying to get them a cut, that’s how you end up with stitches
I tell a bitch quit playing, and play ya position
Either move or get devoured, fuck a coward
I be fresher than these motherfuckers head to toe
If I rocked Eddie Bauer, but I dont
Aura Gold, everything I do I do it overboard Michael Phelps splash,
Smile for the polaroid, self-employed
Now you shelf employed, D-Boy
Never sold, but I still got more lines than corduroy
And I'm with the same crew til I'm an old man
Cause there no such thing as new old friends

[Verse 1]
I know your tears more than you cause I see them so much
That's what happens when you're here with no trust
Okay, I lied, cheated, you cried
You done worse shit and I'm still here right
And motherfuck your friends, all them hoes hating
If you're not down then what's your location
I called and checked in every night and that was not probation
They gave they two cents and we ain't ask for no donation
Man you on some other other shit
Just found out about my other other bitch
Went from I love you to you don't know who you fucking with
Fresh off a vaca' and already need another trip
She said I had enough tries
Oh, and I'm the reason that she doesn't trust guys
What's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
If you wanna leave fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you
So don't tell me you love me
[Verse 2]
Wishing I would've tried more, she wanted the truth
Truthfully I wish I lied more cause when I was true
All I heard was ""bye"" more, ""fuck you""
""Who is that"" and ""I don't know why"" more (Shut da fuck up)
We were picture perfect and I tore it all apart
But if I pick up all the pieces we could still be a collage
Feeling like we ended too soon
Used to stay home and do it in all the rooms
Back shots, I know what you like
Had you hitting high notes and you ain't even need no autotune
Nights I was Patron'd up
Girls dressed alike looking like they cloned up
Same nights I wouldn't pick my phone up
And you was thinking damn boy grow up
And I could still hear her leaving
Crazy when a heart breaks it never breaks even
I even found another girl that's perfect
And I'm the only reason we're not working
Cause what's the perfect girl if it's not the perfect time
And if you wanna stay fine

[Hook]
Just don't tell me you love me
You're gonna make it too hard for me
I wish you were ugly
It wouldn't be so hard to leave
Cause baby I hate to love you
I can't make up my mind
Cause right when I tell you it's over
By the end of the night I be right back in bed with you
I be right back in bed with you

Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls
Yup, diamonds and pearls
And enough money I could rule the world
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
If I ruled the world, I would buy it all
I'm addicted to champagne and buying the mall
I'm addicted to living life above the law
How much do it take to live above the law?
I call my homie Ralph up, cause his car stop
Told him bump a new car, come grab the car lot
That way you can have convertibles, and a hardtop
Open up a few doors, since we had a hard knock, life
Like, open up
Where restaurants and legs stay opened up
Start a franchise so my dawg can quit wearing
A .44 up on his waist like it's his pants size
And to my OG locked up bumping ""Ready or Not""
Who was just trying to do it big, but wasn't ready to die
Cop a first class whatever he like, with hoes already inside
Now he can rest in peace while he alive
Fuckin' right
[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko]

Seems life's never at a standstill, even in a photo
Thinking about the ex-girl, I hoed though
Like would we have won it all, or would I have lost it all like Ocho
The things I think about the most are things I never know though
Like, why don't schools teach more mathematics?
Less trigonometry and more about taxes?
They at the chalkboard, teaching us ass backwards
How about preparing us for life instead of lab rat us?
With a mansion that's about five floors
No more sleeping on the couches, cause we got five more
With the fam that reminded me what I'm alive for
And at the same time remind me what I'd die for
A world where you wouldn't need sleep
That way we could catch up instead of chase dreams
And finally get the speedboat my dad always wanted
Mm, I swear I feel it coming
[Chorus: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko, J. Cole]
Wishing I could wrap my whole life up in 24 karats of gold
Lately, I've been dreaming 'bout diamonds and pearls

And enough money I could rule the world (Cole World)
If I ruled the world, yeah, if I ruled the world (Cole)
If I ruled the world man, it got me thinking man if I ruled the world
If I ruled the world, if I ruled the world
I could rule the world man, if I ruled the world (Cole World)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Is this a dream? Well that's how it feel
Sometimes I got to pinch a fat ass to see if it's real
I specifically remember, no heat in the winter
Now I supply heat for the winter
Then I skate to the beach for the winter
When it comes to chips boy, nigga get a grip
No cleats I'm a winner
Show love to the hoes and the freaks I remember
Hit the club and raise hell all week for the sinners
Meet a young Dennis, the menace to society
Check my sobriety, fuck hoes in varieties
Shame that these things is the reasons you admire me
But, I'm getting dough man, these flows gon' retire me
Splurging all crazy
Switching lanes in the Range swerving all crazy (Swerve)

If I can't do either or, shit it's none of my concern
Watch my enemies burn as I f-fill every urn, ah

Huh, and bitches still telling me to grow up
Don't invite 'em to my shows but always still manage to show up
Man, I made myself a boss and then I gave me a promotion (Whoa)
And I step inside the booth and change the world like I be votin'
So when you step inside my office, treat that bitch like it's the Oval

And it's a few bad Lois Lanes I can't name
Even though I'm me, Lord knows that I can't save
But I'm still the same me, same clique, the same hood, the same bitch
I came up, my bank up, but I stack that like I ain't rich
Back when we was on college tours with Wale, man, we ain't make shit
From Greensboro to SoCal, man all the way back to Cambridge
And Michigan State, close to my Michigan estate
Man, we was tryna get away, man, we was tryna get ordained
And damn, tomorrow never seemed so close
And life ain't what it seem no mo'
'Til I was standing next to Puff and Hov, off the French coast
A million dollars never seemed so broke
And every bitch I'm fucking praying they the one I settle with
And niggas suin' me and they just banking on the settlement
Never settlin', life is too fast just to settle in
So many rocks up in my bezel, police thought embezzlement
Like damn

Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Yeah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Yeah

[Verse: Big Sean]
This the feeling know that I been missing some days
This feel like I'm headed to paradise one way
This feel like the family dinners that we used to have
On Sunday with Grandma in the kitchen making rum cake
Or the spread she used to do for Thanksgiving, man
This feels like the first time I heard Killa Cam
Pink Timb's, in the Lamb, mixing it in with Dilla and
Headphones to the ceiling fan, bucket hat like Gilligan (Yeah)
Lately, I been talking to ghosts
Didn't learn faith in school but that's what I'm testing the most
You know I still rep you when you're gone, though
I got a picture of us on the front lawn
With me, Grandma and Mom, that night I went off to prom
Wishin' you could see the lights all dijon and parmesan
Funny thing about it, you always act like you knew
You told me I would feel it would happen before it do
And you taught me I'm a product of everything I go through
And you and Grandma went broke so we would never get bruised
You the reason that I ever touched my first Franklin
Fast forward, I'm in Kanye crib with Kirk Franklin
It reminded me of how we used to dress up
As a family and go to Sunday service, and be in church singin'
Ain't been to church in a while, but it ain't just 'bout how you just praise Him
In the building, it's about how you praisin' Him while you out
You taught me to remember that when I get set back
Been through the worst times to get the best back
Wishin' for a time machine to jet back
To my all time low self and throw me a jetpack, woah
And see you again, needless to say
Back when I dated Alisha, Simone, or any other
Girl look like Lisa Bonet whose jealous of me and Jhené
Who you would always advise would be in the way
You was right, but I had to learn for myself
I guess a time came for me to earn for myself
I hope that this is somewhat a thank you for all your help
Hope the angels take care of ya 'til I see you myself
[Bridge: The-Dream]
Praise
So many times
I prayed for you
I put up prayers for you
Praise
For all the times
That you prayed for me
All the nights you stayed by me
All the nights that you cried
And all the days I coulda died
Because of you, I survived
Because of you, I'm still alive

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Thanking God for all my setbacks
'Cause He the reason I'm able to get back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back, woah
Feel like I sent the prayers up and got blessed back
This feel like my Sunday morning jetpack
Yeah

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school, man, right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She asked why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look at what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you

[Hook: Big Sean]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
[Bridge: Big Sean]
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 2: Nas]
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff?
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
'Cause it's a mental game
I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated, I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm copping stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on
Not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?

[Hook: Big Sean]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was Illmatic
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flyin'
I know the higher the goal, the harder the climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
'Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick, paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills til' my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor, I've been dodging shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain
[Hook: Big Sean]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Bridge: Big Sean]
Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain

[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches are with you cuz where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin' hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now? Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is, the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go, my life is fucking awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now, but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought don't know the god
'Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance, I'm signing off with a crotch grab

And I wish that this could last forever
But maybe one night is even better
Real nigga mayne, all the people I plotted with
Is the same ones I'm dividin' the profits with
Now I'm in the building like two planes bitch
Kickin' it with my shirt off, on some Liu Kang shit
Sleep with the sun up like I grew fangs bitch
I come alive in the night, on some Bruce Wayne shit
Livin' my life, gettin' high payments
Fuckin' with some new broads and they high maintenance
And they wearin' high heels, trip so we're on high hills
Tits sittin' high, rollin' zips, gettin' high man

Make love and then join the mile high club

Sippin' somethin' cold, smokin' weed by the pound size
Yeah I gotta big head ho, I think it's crown size
Bitch I do it big and I never plan to downsize
People who talk shit, is feelin' like dickheads
Saw me on the web like I had a extra six legs
Lookin' at my highlights with a bitch with highlights
Crowd wavin' at me, all tryna say hi right

You be up in the club, I be up in the clouds
Ooh, don't gotta ask me if I brought enough cause' we don't run out
Blow it by the O, even my fans smoke it
Cause' they throw it at my shows hidin' it when I travel
In case the police gotta know, rollin' it up in traffic
Make you smoke out of a bong, put you on different hashes
My chick is the baddest, my spliff is the fattest, I'm livin' so lavish
Gotta patch a lil kid tryna get at this cabbage

Off the scale, yeah we about to break the richter quick

[Verse]
Okay now, why you wanna go and do that, do that?
Sometimes I say that I'm the best, I guess I had to prove that
You know I had to cop that mansion on the hill and pool that
You know I don't rely on 8 balls, no, I never pooled that
You know I always like the best, roll it up and pull that
Now baby, don't get too deep on me, I might have to pull back
I got weed rolled, drinks po'd if you wanna do that
And I be in and out of love, the OGs be like true that
Cause you know sometimes man, that shit can get way too irritating
Say the wrong thing to the right girl, you might not make it
Dark skin with a lightskin girl like Taye Diggs
And you go from tryna save her to her taking your savings
And when she do, man, watch how them bitches shit talk
Wonder how they would feel if our lives got criss-crossed
What if you lost your homie and you felt like Kriss Kross?
Double cross, I swear that Christians don't even get this crossed
Talk so much shit that a nigga pissed off
She talk so much that she done fucking made my dick soft
Pushing all my buttons, this ain't fucking pinball
I guess women are sometimes like a jigsaw
Sometimes you hit a lick, sometimes you get ripped off
Sometimes you gotta sit, sometimes it's time for lift-off
Sometimes I just shut up and let my wrist talk
It be like ""we don't got time for bullshit, dawg""
You know I'm 1 of 1, just like the prototype
You look like the ""um, you owe me"" type
Oh, hardly never taking pictures, not the photo type, no
Please don't Instagram this shit and be up on me like
""Oh, you owe me likes""
Man, I swear these bitches don't know what the fuck is more important to em
The more I kick philosophy, the more I'm boring to em
The more champagne I pop, the more I'm pouring to em
I just hope that's not the only single thing that's going through em
I hop up on a beat like it's the '08 me
When we was riding four deep, boy, no AC
Headed to the game for okay seats
Now I'm courtside at OKC, I know KD
And all these singing bitches know me like do-ray-mi
Fa-so-la-ti-do but dough come first
No late fees, Kool-Aid smile, Colgate teeth
The bigger that I get, the more I need shrinks
I be in and out of cars like a fucking crash dummy
Spending money till it's dizzy but I still stash something, you know
But I'm tryna get that real real money, like um
White people with a black son
And first time I met Oprah, that was motivation
Went from standing in court to starting up a corporation
Went so hard last night that we made the morning paper
Plus my girl's rated R, all your hoes overrated, damn
Niggas say I changed, how they damn how they do
Say I'm hard to get in contact with, oh, is that true?
But what about now? 313

Haters praying I fall, move back in with my moms
Take online classes and turn back into y'all, hating
I guess they want your lights out when you the plug
Niggas wanna catch you slipping like they pulled the rug
From where they move the drugs, Buddha love
Niggas sleeping with that MAC and I ain't talking 'bout computer love
Owe the wrong people, you a price tag
Now you pray to God, hoping that you got a Christ tag (God)
Make it where I'm from, stay who I become
Time to raise hell, Satan ain't my son
Take a elevator straight up out the slums to a penthouse view

I go extra harder the first second you doubt me
I strive for perfection; at the same time, I'm acceptin' the fact
That there'll never be nothing perfect about me

Come up with better hooks, the hoes'll take it on the chin
We are 6 Mile-bred, that's why you see our sick style, yeah
Crackhouse flow with a pit downstairs
Momma happy at me, daddy happy at me
The baddest chicks, as y'all can imagine, is chatty, yapping at me
Five years ago, I was in tears in the back of a paddy wagon
Now I'm Cali swagging
Huh, my nigga listen, I'm over the fame
You number one, I'm number 23, my mission is take over the game
You rollin' with lames? We ain't rolling the same
I'm the best out in this motherfucker
If I could get a check out of this motherfucker
Big enough to set my kids up for life

I got a—I got a fine, 'cause I ain't wanna vote, I promise
I know the history of those who died for the rights for me to survive
But those who lied to the minority will make 'em turn inside they grave
I can easily pretend like y'all but that's not me

Ask God if them polls important, the end is near

Now it's back to me nigga
I took my clique turned it to faculty nigga
Took my operation to factory nigga
When I'm in the zone they won't tackle me nigga
I touched down in the city, a fuckin' walkin' target
Still man all my bitches miss me, yeah they miss me but not misses
If you ask me what my interest, all my interest involve interest
It ain't nothing to cut that bitch off but you can't cut my percentage (No no)
With the bases loaded all we need's a hit, boy I'ma still swing for the fences (Gone)
I guess you tend to over do it when you come up underprivileged, look
I came to my senses, I can never count on people
I can't even trust the senses in this world full of venom
All I need's my spider senses, my short temper to cool out
Yeah sometimes I need woosah, time to get paid by the goo-ghaas
My office on top of that rooftop, for my mama Myra Anderson
Tell me who gon' be set for life, Myra and her son, fo' sure
One time for the fam, they don't eat, I don't eat
I can't rest on my feet till they all on they feet
They say rest your eyes, I'm just like why?
Bitch I ain't never seen Ben Frank asleep
But I do need that paper like sheet after sheet
I got so much drive ho, look both ways in the streets
When I heard 'bout all these singers and all they naked pictures I'm like ""Did my email just leak?""
[Interlude]
Hol' up
Lemme check, oh nah nah nah
They fake, we good, we good

[Verse 2]
The stock goin' up, makin' all the right moves
Boy you would have thought I got tipped off (Tipped off)
You would have thought these niggas fell off a skateboard
The way they take these hoes and trick off (Trick off)
I got a rich girl, I swear to god dawg, man she's like a walkin' ATM
Except she ain't come in with drawls
I know you've been having G.O.O.D. Music withdrawls
I can not deal with the fuckery that fake shit you be in
All that bullshit that you rappin' honestly just makes me cringe
Money doesn't grow on trees, okay someone explain to me
Then how the hell does my whole team just keep on rakin' it all in, hah?
We stressed on, we pressed on
Met with Hov and Bey they told us we next on
We dream that, been slept on, we kept on, we left home
Mama earlobes is VS stone
Her earrings so big she can't even fuckin' hear nothing nigga
Don't give a fuck, no I can't spare one nigga
No I do not have five wheels, I can't spare one nigga
Talkin' like I'm on the last cigarette because I had to take it back to square one nigga
Sometimes to win the war man you got to lose a battle
But if I lose a girl just know my next one gonna be badder
When I pulled up to the church, ooo, they thought it was the pastor
Heaven sent, raisin' hell, same time, what that's the rapture?
Didn't go to class for a second I swear I woulda failed everything
My passport was the only thing I'm passin', flyin' overseas turnin' dreams into habits
Turnin' coach to first classes, mom I'm never movin' back
And I put six years in the flow, okay, no wonder it got mastered
The flow need a dam, why it's doin' too much damage
God damn it's good to get it, even better with ya niggas
Call up my dog who been in and out depression
Said boy how you living, don't lie to me 'bout your feelings
On the outside you look fine but on the inside could be killin'
You act like a comedian but now you're Robin Williams
And now we cryin' rivers that nobody wants to swim in
When one phone call coulda been the one to prevent it
So I'm there for my dogs till we forever on
Till we hit the dealership and cop the Megazord
Nigga that's the red range, white range, black range, green range, pink range
Yellow range, blue range, every neck comes with a few chains (Ohh shit)
I learned that every bad bitch comes with mood swings
Just like Mortal Kombat, Liu Kang, so true man
G-5 down to Mexico, G.O.O.D. Music familiar man
We back at it to let you know, I figure it's best you know
In the middle of recordin' we got caught up in the news
About what happened in St. Louis
We midwest kids that shit coulda happened to us
I looked up the flight tonight
Then I realized man I got a grandma now that's half alive
And honestly what happened in St. Louis probably happened in Detroit like twenty times
I hope we finally see the signs
Puttin' gas off in my Benzo, I ran into a youngin'
The same age as me except he in the trash huntin'
Asked me for some change I gave him like one somethin'
Man to keep that shit a hunnid I wish I woulda gave a hunnid
Cause if you ask me how I'm doin', shit you could do the math
I just bought a five bedroom, four bath
Three story, two car garage, I'm one man
I just did it for my mom, finna do it for my dad
And I ain't even sell my soul, imagine what I coulda got for that
I made something out of nothing, it's like I pulled it out a hat
Man when I'm done they gonna statue me, I turned my clique faculty
Operations to factory, in my zone they won't tackle me

Like, whoa, whoa
Sean Don, whoa
D-Boys
Look

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
All I gotta say is what a year, what a year
I decided now that every year is our year
Aw yeah man, that's 'til we disappear
I'm focused on the near and never what's in the rear
Recently I swear man we've had so many accolades
I realized I ain't sat down, not even on a Saturday
Yeah I'm going over time, O.T like it's TNT
In South America rocking Rio with RiRi
You know that's, stadium status
When you started underground, you gotta make it to the attics
So I'm up in addict Focus, money is the only time I ADD
Going off more than ADT, making power moves like: back, forward, punch, kick, A, B, B
Boy this shit ABC's, shout out Detail, 7-11 we on the road
I'm on the sixth record off the album going gold
Last one woke they ass up like the morning show
I'm tryna make next year the greatest story ever told
Like, shit, goddamn, standing next to Jay and K, like man
Never took an L and I'm out there from where it's hard to make it this far when you this tan
I'm sayin' I'm Lil B with the right wrist
I realized time make money, it's priceless
So don't gas me up bitch, I'm a hybrid
I know you like it, I see the job's done before I see my eyelids
It's getting better every single day, that's what they told me
And I already wasn't fuckin' with the old me
[Chorus: Detail & Pharrell]
It's like I hit the light switch
Woah, yeah
I feel like I hit the light switch (yeah)
It's like I took my family into a new crib
Then I hit the light switch
I took my whole life and then I hit the light switch (Aww yeah)
So I'ma hop out and roll on 'em (Yeah)
Hop out and roll on 'em
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life
I'ma roll on 'em (Yeah, say what?)
Hop out and roll on 'em
(I got the light switch, light switch)

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Look, what's life without risk?
If you take none, that's probably what you gonna get
This year I'm done with crazy hoes
If it's one thing I hate its lazy hoes
Goddamn, if it's two things I hate, it's greedy hoes
One time for my girls that turn theyself into CEOs
Just know that you the finest
I like older girls that realize they got time left
I like young girls, but not girls young-minded
Ones that shine with you but they won't get blinded
We just went around the world in twenty-eight days
Shows selling more tickets than the matinees
Sold out everywhere, bad bitch cheer
All I gotta say is ""What a year, what a year""
Up late, two, three, tryna get the mic skills
Riding 'round ATL, shout out my bro Mike-Will
Making sure the fam straight like they like they up in Mike will
Every Mike, Jordan, Tyson, Jackson
Need the, uh, Washingtons, Franklins, Jacksons
Got the crowd packed in, front in, back in
Like oh, please stop comparing me
You starting up a new whip? I'm starting up a charity
While you got new chains, my family out of debt nigga
Yeah, respect last longer than a check nigga
RIP for my ones who couldn't see the day
I really wish they would have saw me get a VMA
I know my grandma ain't here but it's cool cause as long as I'm around she gon' be here in my DNA
I went from broke to breaking records in the city where I live
While I was breaking that down, they broke into the crib
But they can't break the dream shout to the ones I dreamed with
I ain't rich 'til the whole team rich
It's like...
[Chorus: Detail & Pharrell]
I hit the light switch
Woah, yeah
I feel like I hit the light switch (Yeah)
It's like I took my family into a new crib
Then I hit the light switch
I took my whole life and then I hit the light switch (Aww yeah)
So I'ma hop out and roll on 'em (Yeah)
Hop out and roll on 'em
It's like a fresh pair of dice but I'm rolling on they life
I'ma roll on 'em (Yeah, say what?)
Hop out and roll on 'em
(I got the light switch, light switch)

[Outro: Detail]

Pull out the 'Ville
You got the healing

Yeah, woah, woah
I just been feeling like, it's all clickin', ya know?
Hit-Boy
Like it's all working out, and I'm 'bout to work out
Colossal
B.I.G, look

[Verse]
The universe been throwing me all the signs except stop it
Niggas been plotting on me, but here's the plot twist
I can't throw fits no more unless it's profits
Lord, why you keep boxing me in, 'cause I'm God's gift?
I might set my mic back up in the closet, though
Just to give myself that same feeling from '04
When my hunger was more, advice to you and yours
They say it's over for you, that's when you go overboard, okay?
Shit, I didn't take a break, my nigga, I broke
Broke my heart, broke my soul, don't cry for me though
If you don't break nothing down then it's no room to grow
One mental block lead to another, shit it's dominos
Mixtape Sean, but I'm in album mode, ooh
She give me praise, I love her angel face
Ass so fat she could work at TSA (Damn)
I went to school at Cass, Aaliyah went to DSA a mile away
Just letting you know the types of kings and queens my city make and I probably need a parade
All the soldiers with me, this shit like green beret
So legendary, I'ma probably need a day (June 29th)
Forgot I already got one, be dammed if I'm not one
You talking 'bout the hottest in the city, most influential rappin' ass niggas and I'm the top one
Me and Em' knocked down doors for y'all that was locked once
I know they may never get me, I still put on for the city like the Lions first round picked me
I ain't been fucking I been too busy, I got two phones they both business, I got fake ones tryin' to end me
I got real ones gon' defend me like a fucking co-defendant
I got Don Life on my pendant, I’m conditioned to do the distance
And I just set up the pensions, family set like my intentions
Been balancing trying to keep my company with the girls who wanna keep me company
You know the ones who claim they over me but would much rather be under me
Is confident and been through too much just to be done with me
And you know that shit gets stressful right?
Shit taxing, the same thing that got Wesley Snipes
And you know how I'm rocking, rocking Elvis Presley white
You know highlight reelin'
All highlights like we sitting on top of museum ceilings
No more resisting
If you ain't on my frequency, you out of tune and not tuned in
To break the unbreakable, escape the unescapable
'Til you push your fucking limits, you don't even know what's capable
Fuck that shit that you believe in, I believe in me
Talkin' on they phones and PC like they off that PCP
Bitch, I spit that Eazy-E, face to face, Smack DVD
I don't got no time for hanging out and all that E-T-C
Just cut the check, C-T-C, Godbody my physique
I can look inside your eyes and know exactly what you mean
Fuck you mean? Energy the first language that I speak
No facade, I belong in the Palace of Versailles with a queen by my side
In this hot girl summer, I'm just trying to find a wife
Visualizing from every island that's on Hawaii
With my team on each side, like ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
With the last laugh like Kawhi
And you know that you that one when you beat all the other odds
I keep one foot planted at home and the other one on a swivel though
Gotta keep 'em both 'cause this shit get way too pivotal
All the work is analog, all the payment digital
When tempers tend to flare up, I'm the one to be cool since preschool
I know which ones that's been rocking with me, dawg, since the prequel
Just be cool
I know your favorite one, dawg, I'm 'bout to drop the sequel
Nigga, this just the preview

Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go head and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it then real life’d it!
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch? I’m moonwalking!
And my middle name Michael ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Muthafuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong niggas more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’mma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cuz honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
[Verse 2]
Are you willing to give up what you love for who you love
Or lose your girlfriend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til' you considered great?
How many missed calls til' you considered fake?
How many dreams before its considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cuz they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes, you don’t know how that shit feels mentally!
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say “in memory”
I’m praying that he make it, wishin' we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those be the best memories…

[Hook]
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Ooooh ohho ooooooooo
[Verse 3]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Was mailed one when I heard Nique had died in that crash
Seemed like yesterday I just seen him smile and laugh
I’m stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, like who swallows the darts
And with my Mama looking at cribs that we can’t purchase
Houses bigger than a palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I’m focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles
I’m marathoning to the money and you just running off in a circle
Man, I’m huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner’s circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan’
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal $20 bill right out her purses
No I ain’t perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die, of course I have the memories..

Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
These will be the best memories

From the West but I'm heading to the Northside
That's the top, I need a crib on the shoreside
I need a backyard full court size
From where the judge is the only thing that's courtside
Chasing money in the city of crime
Cashback so then it's black bags under my eyes
Man fuck it I got a dream worth more than my sleep
To me playing in the game is worth more than the seats
Man fuck these hating ass bitches I'm gone
They told me no then I reverse it I'm on, I'm on!
I'm on, I'm on, they told me no then I reverse it I'm on
Mama had two jobs I know that she was working for me
Ten years later, hired to working for me
Hired the whole family like mobsters
Getting paid off our operation we ain't even doctors
Grandma called, see me on the Billboards around the city
Man going around around the world so many times I'm dizzy
London or Japan, Orlando, Walt Disney
Paris, Abu-Dhabi, California weed twistin' man!
Texas to Toronto where they love that nigga Drizzy
All the way to Detroit, the whole city fucking with me
Heading to the money, whole city coming with me
And I'mma rep the city 'til the reaper come and get me yup!

[Chorus 1: Big Sean]
And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go
[Verse 2: Wale]
Sitting back, putting all my issues in a swisher
I keep it funky with my Mrs, fuck these other bitches
And this ain’t biblical but this sermon is spiritual
‘Cause when it come to winning, convincing is only been a few
The upper percentile
Whipping whatever I, 460LS you
I probably go less miles, stay in a small circle
Know that it’s God working
Police got the swine flu and these niggas is reptiles
Yeah, Maybach poetic genius
You buying a seven jeans, keep mine in a 7 Bimmer
I’m trampolining on niggas and I actually mean it
A fly nigga, I keep having a gravity grievance
And while these niggas keep hating, they be asking for features
That’s like a complacent atheist is asking for Jesus
Riding around without a fuck given
Behind them dirty plates like a catcher with a mitten
The best in my position, I’m passionate with lyrics
And they ain’t fucking with the kid like Chris Hansen in the kitchen
I’m handsome to these women, I’m envied by these no ones
That’s no Joakim Noah, nigga everybody know us
And even if you don’t drink everybody po’ up
‘Cause all these hating niggas probably never gon’ show up
Never hate on no one, your blessing’s getting closer
Even when I’m open, it's nothing to Ed Cota wassup
[Chorus 1: Big Sean]
And this is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Good people, good drinks, good smoke
Got me thinking this is how life should go
This is how life should go
Everything I wanted never seem so close
Family all around, all highs no lows
Got me thinking this is how life should go

Could you tell me where to go? I need direction
Where are we now? Where's the intersection?
Motherfuck my phone, it never has reception
In this cold world, it's all about collection
So I, I stack paper and keep it ghetto
Oh, cause when you rich you are on top of the world
I made a promise to the mirror
That I'd, never ever ever go broke
Riding through the city, I be riding through the city
All I know is bad bitches, I got Finally Famous with me though
Plenty smoke, plenty rolled

Well, I’m flyin' over, literally, flyin' over cities
Got my carry-on but really wish I had a pound with me though
My watch is thirty thousand dollars, Dolce and Gabbana
I done spent so much in Prada, I don't wanna know
I'm the reason that your bitch is smoking weed now
No blunts, lil' bro wan' roll up joints
Seen the how-to video now he on point
And he tryna make it front row to the show to throw me one
If I ever hand you some weed, it's free, you don't owe me none
Just put on one of me or Big Sean's CDs and roll me some
And there's only one, you know you know

I'm going in (I'm going in), 'til I'm going numb ('til I'm going numb)

I just hold money, don't hold me up
Rolling in more green than a hole in one
You got more than me? Then shit roll somethin'
See I be off of that tree, people tell me I shouldn't be
But early on, my mom taught me that everything green is good for me
I wake up to three girls, my role model is Hugh Hef
I gave ya girl a t-shirt since she gave the whole crew neck
I don't dance, I two-step, my weed loud, it suplex
I came up from that basement, man straight up out of that duplex
Bitch, if I ain't a G, I'm an OG
Two fingers on my joint, one to the police

Finally Famous in this..

[Verse 1]
It's crazy how they think you got it all figured out
Just because your bank account gets all figured out
Next time somebody try and tell you how to run your shit
And they ain't major shit
Do yourself a favor: kick 'em out
Eat good and do that, you'll live a long life
I always say long days is better than long nights
At least in the day you've got shade
In the night its all shadows, don't get caught at wrong lights
I wish somebody would have told B.I.G. that before March 9th
I used to think there's no such things as wrong rights
'Till my stepbrother brought home them extra groceries
Extra cheese, now mom could make her special recipe
But I didn't know it was off of infested streets
Now he the reason I've got to walk with my little niece to go eat
I guess that's the hunger that got me out
At the top of hotel suites renting the lobbies out, you know?
Stuntin' like a bitch, prom night me out
And the girl I've wanted since ninth grade trying to route
That was back
When
I was seventeen
It's crazy though, cause even then I thought I had
It all figured out
[Hook: James Fauntleroy]

[Verse 2]
It's crazy how much that you can see with your eyes closed
'Specially if you've got a vision
Or how you could have everything
And still think about everything missing
Like I probably remember the times that I missed out on
More than the ones I lived
I probably remember the girls that I ain't have
More than the ones I did
But I remain a two timing, one girl on the way
Two lying and one bed-never too tired
Smoke so much I need two lighters
Shoppin overseas I do buy it, who higher?
They taught me that I had to dream, black history month
I wake up and treat the day like stack history month
I'm talkin' Malcolm Flex, Jessie Rackson
Front of the plane: I'm Rozay Parks
SUV swervin like it's O.J.'s car, oh
To me and my dogs is all gettin out
Somewhere in the club probably all liquored out
Finna take extra shots for my dogs missin' out
That keep remindin' me at the same time
That I still ain't got it all figured out
Fact, the only thing I really figured out
Is that I'll never have it all figured out, fuck
Even when your bank account is all figured out
Even when your bank account gets all figured out
Even when your best friend gets all triggered out
Even when it.. all of it... when you still ain't got....
[Outro]
Today I woke up and realized every day gets shorter
Every minute turns to the longest second, yet never ending
Age is nothing but a reminder and it doesn't tell you
How old or young minded someone is
Cause we all start at the same starting point of a woman's legs
But each have our own finish line
Understand it never ends, and the only way to be immortalized
Is to be remembered, hopefully from right than wrong
Better to be in the hall of fame than shame
Whether it exists for what you do or not
We create this world so we make what exists
It isn't about the award, it's about the award of being immortalized
And remembered for all the right reasons
Mistakes are forgotten, no footprints of any missteps
So when it's so late that it's early
And you need a drink even though the bar's closed
Remember why you do what you do
For the coldest drinks, the fastest cars, luxury
The adrenaline rush of creating what you think about
With who thinks about you:
Your family, your team
The joy of looking back and saying that you did it
Winning the game: hall of fame14Embed"

See, Ferg used to move the product in the old school (Yeah)
Thumbing through paper from last year but it's not old news (Right)
My psycho bitch, she got me shopping up at Whole Foods
Fucking these cougars like a young nigga s'posed to
I got your bitch up on the mattress while I'm flying OT (Woo!)

You know what you do

You know what you - you don't know what you do!

[Verse 1: Big Sean]
How about we pretend all these niggas not around
And get fucked up like we was out of town
Woah, then get fucked up and go get out of town
Swerve, swerve
And tell ourselves that one time doesn't count, tell me
How fucked up you down to get?
A pound? A zip? A thousand sips
Red cup yeah that college shit
Free liquor got it on scholarship
Bitch act like you don't know what's up
Act like it ain't my crew blowing up
Lose not to much champagne, no throwing up
One time for the set, please go throw it up
It's Finally Famous, overbooked, overpaid and overpriced
But don't get it twisted, that shit ain't happen overnight
Had dreams of balling now I'm NFLing
Let her spend the night, she feel like Cinderella
All she tell me is-
[Hook: Ellie Goulding]

You don't know what you-

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get dressed up
I know, I know, I know I'm the reason you get messed up
Heart breaker, young heart breaker
When you get in the game I swear the whole world commentates you
But man, I don't give a fuck what they saying, I don't give a fuck about opinions
I don't give a fuck about feelings, I ain't no dentist, either I did, I do or I didn't
You could try to tell me how to live my life, I ain't hearing it
I must be doing something right if every mill comes with a spare I guess
Straight, straight, straight up out that dirt, but my t-shirt clean, ohh
Do it for the city, that's the 313
That's unnecessary, fuck her like she my secretary
Ass and face is hereditary, her momma, shit, legendary
You don't know what you do
[Hook: Ellie Goulding]
You don't know what you do!
You know what you do
You know what you do
You don't know what you do!

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me (You, you, you)

[Verse 1]
You tried to keep me away from temptation
Introduced me to The Temptations
Marvin Gaye and Isley Brothers
Dancing so hard the living room shaking
Yeah we dance in the house
My mama's the man of the house
Mama you too good for them men
Even dad, you too good for him
Mama, you know you inspire me
You deserve early retirement
You text me, tell me to take my vitamins
When I got a new love you invite 'em in
When we break up, you don't like 'em then (No)
Loyal, loyal, swear you super loyal
Worth more to me than striking oil
You deserve the life I'm tryna show ya
I remember all of the sacrifices
Growing up in debt, but never hungry
Rich in everything except money
That's that faith that you can't buy
But I buy that new crib, you look right in it
I buy that new car in the color that you like it in
And play my song every single time you drive in it
That's 'cause you inspired it (yeah)

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard to get me on the line
I'm busy like every other time
Since I got a house in that other town
You wonder when I'ma come around
I know you worry about me
I give you attitude like, ""Don't worry 'bout it""
Don't hit ya up like I don't care about you
But I hold you down, I swear I got you
I know I got problems communicating
I probably should've went to school
And got that degree in communications
I should be with you on vacation
I should take you where you should be taken
Asia, Africa, Dubai, anything you want, I do buy
Just want you to know I do try
To take care of ya, mama
You the one, you the one, you the one
You the moon, you the stars, you the sun
I'm so happy I'm your son
I'm so happy I'm your son
You love me since day one
Since before day one
So before the day's done
I gotta, gotta let you know

You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me
Can't go wrong, wrong, wrong
You do the right thing, you know you inspire me

[Outro]
Look, mama, you know you inspire me
If I ever made you not feel like it, then this is my apology
So sorry, look, dear mama, you know your son shine for ya
I'm Sean for ya, my lady
Don't you ever let 'em talk to you crazy

Get a finer one, and then clone that

How soon is too soon?

But if we keep messing with the wrong people
At the right place, at the right time, we might let it

Chill, I won't tell all your secrets

Lucky me
If they want my spot, then they gotta come for me
Just know I want this shit more than whatever it is you want from me
And the only thought at night that comforts me is starvin' whoever's huntin' me
Shit, lucky me, to be rich in a world where nothing's free
And separated from hell by one degree
Surrounded by niggas who did first degree
And the other ones that never got they first degree, sheesh
Lucky me (Nigga!)
Yeah, I done slashed hoes like I'm Slash on some rock star shit
Even bought Slash old crib, that's rock star as it gets
And have my hands on the R&B legends you couldn't handle
Whether you do music or not, you wish you could sample
And I had to live through the scandals
Public humiliations and breakups on camera
It's a living nightmare when your dream girl has to get canceled
And you gotta delete all the photos and shit like you never Instagrammed it
And you get off-track but somehow you gotta stay transit, ha
Man, lucky me
I was diagnosed with a heart disease at 19
Could barely stand on my feet
Doctors said they had to cut it open, put a pacemaker on it to put it back on beat
'Til my mama took me to holistic doctors and they prescribed me magnesium for two weeks
Went back to the regular doctors and they said, ""Huh, damn, looks like we don't need to proceed""
That's how I know that western medicine weak
Man, lucky me, to be the chosen one
And saved for the special occasions like I was Opus One
You know, and I'ma live forever like Walt Disney, the frozen one
Done flew so many times past the limit, I didn't even know it was one
And face our problems head-on when they told us to run
And ran it up in a city where no one would come
When I had literally died but then came back alive
And it's the furthest thing that I know from over and done
And I don't even have to say it, you know where I'm from, bitch (Yeah, yeah)
Lucky me, lucky who? (Lucky) Lucky, true
It's a wonder what prayer, working smart and love can do
And y'all got an efficient and humble crew
And you got a long list of the things y'all wanna do
Shit, who knows, lucky me could turn into lucky you
We turned nothing to something so much it's nothing new
I know lady luck so well, I swear that's like my bottom bitch, number two
Doing what we love and choose with lots to lose and more to prove
Ain't running from nothing but haven't lost sight of the finish line that we been runnin' to
Lil' bitch, this Detroit-fucking-2
My thoughts is all-black, yeah, I'm back to the roots
Fuck your white flag, ho, I don't want no truce
And we all in the huddle, they like, ""It's on you""
Hm, lucky me (Me), pressure's what I eat
Ain't no roses at my feet, just the blood on the concrete, look (Hit-Boy on the beat, so bitch you gotta go berserk)
[Chorus]
The mission is covert
I stuck to the code and you don't know the code word
Once they start me up then just know that it's over (Woah, woah)
My soul is on solace, surrounded by angels and soldiers on soldiers
World turned me cold, game turned me colder
Sittin' courtside lookin' like I'm finna be the fuckin' future owner (Woah)
Cup runneth over and she comin' over (Woah)
And she told me that her lil' bro wanna be me when he older (That's facts)

Woah there, don't go there, now slow down, lil' brodie
I know you don't know me
I'm buffed up, my chest up, I feel like Hulk Hogan
I walk in the building like everybody owe me
Move heaven on Earth, this shit feel like erosion
The Don, I'm the king, I'm consultin' the soldiers
You talk to me nice and not real, I'm insulted
I bet on myself, ain't no way my hand's folding
What's a limitation? Fuck your validation
I don't got a figure, God flow, got it renovated
Demon slayer and my bitch slayin', legendary, it's insinuated
Two guards outside barricaded while I'm serenadin' (Yeah)
Paradise covin' while I'm stroking
Pussy tight, I'm claustrophobic
She so damn down and devoted
Got me wondering what's her motives (What's her—)
Remember my feelings don't mean shit to none of my goals, so I gotta stay focused
The city is soulless, this shit get too vulgar
Seen bodies wrapped up in them white sheets, no COVID

Dumped all my other hoes, shout out to Nay-Nay
I start my day with a prayer and vagjayjay
I'm higher than Day-Day, no off day just pay day

Textin' these hoes that you love 'em and shit, prolly using them Emoji's

Fuck you know about night terrors, nightmares and night scares
About not gettin' that white money 'fore a young nigga get white hair
And I done dropped ""Control"" just to show you hoes who done got controlled
You saying that I changed, yep, changed like I supposed
While you at the same crib still wearin' the same clothes
Going to the same club, taking the same pose
Pillow talkin' with the same hoes
All day about how Em ain't the same Em
And Hov ain't the same Hov

I guess that what coming up in Detroit do
Finally famous is a Detroit crew
Fuck with me and you Detroit food
End up on the fuckin' Detroit news, better off in the Detroit zoo
Everybody got haters, I swear we been through this
Martin had Malcolm, Caesar had Brutus
Fuck am I sayin', man, Jesus had Judas
I guess I'm alright though, if I just got you, bitch
You gon' pull up friend to friend, I'mma pull up Benz to Benz
While you and her are cheek to cheek, me and her dick to chin

Fuck with me get a room for daisies on the dirt
I prefer brown liquor, brown ladies, brown Louis Vuitton
Condom on 'fo I go to work, that's my uniform
Nigga I used to eat mayonnaise sandwiches
By candle lit, and that’s cause the power’s out
And not for no romance and shit (No!)
From barely managing to mansions
Where ho’s call me Mr. Anderson
Command a bitch, no I don’t own the pussy I just sample it
I got a couple marbles missing I know
Now there’s marbles all on the floor
On the bathroom, kitchen and stove
I got bitches on my cellular callin' and confessing
But I don’t reply cause thats the clearest way to send a message
Paper running through my jugular
I’m blowing loud, throwing thous, getting drunk
You know my style
And my momma still say she proud, that’s mula
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
I'm winning, I don't owe nann nigga shit
Came in this motherfucker by myself
Smoking on strong, and holding on my dick like AH
My gold on, I'm the bomb, I'm talking goldmine
Nigga's taking shots at me, I send em' back to their homeline
And I touchdown, goal line, y'all ain't killing shit
Brrrraatttt, shoot every nigga in your clique
I'm on one, let me jog your memory
Me and Nells on the milerun, uh
Shawty gonna need her drawers done
Eat her pussy til' it's all gone, uh
And I still ain't ever been robbed, so nigga don't try me
Two niggas with guns, snatch yo' wallet
That's pickpocket, they want my I.D, and I spaz on em'
Treat niggas like strippers and put cash on em'
Got a new chopper and that bitch still got a tag on it
If you shoot me, you famous, if I shoot you, I'm brainless
So I'm about to be dumb as fuck
Cause' God blesses fools in badges
When I was fifteen I was felon
When you were fifteen you were yelling:
""Mama come get this nigga off my fucking melon, DAMN IT!""
[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah

[Verse 4: Earlly Mac]
Scared money never gon' make nothin', (thats right)
Gotta get it my medula
Couple dollars in the waist band, (thats right)
Nigga hula-hoop with the mula
Everyday that I wake I say grace
Hallelujah welcome back like Mase
Bitches only fuck niggas with the cream
A nigga this fresh ain't never gon' date
Ay, they say we can't maintain
Only real niggas remain
'Ye say that we the new slaves
I need to ball with a chain
I got a real bad bitch I haven't seen her in a month
With some twins so big she can put em' in a bunk
Ooh I love it when she drop it and spread it like 
When I see the camel all I wanna do is hump
Okay the Hall of Fame keep callin' my name
Got a mural on the wall I'mma legend
Okay, I'm from the motor city and been have drive
I just need a little gas in my engine
Okay, we all in the game and we ballin' the same but
Home team nigga thats a blessing
I'm a bad mothafucker just tryna get some credit
So good it can get me into heaven, nigga

[Chorus: Big Sean]
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Ain't nothing more important than the mula
Hallelujah, hallelujah, praise God, hallelujah
Ain't nothing more important than the mula

""Might not make it this time""
Is what not to say at this time
Sometimes, the truth ain't what you need to hear
And you tell them they alright, knowing they need a cure
How I'mma believe in paradise if I don't see the sand
Only palm trees I got is this weed off in my hand
Around the same time my mom said ""Sean, you need a plan
Miss Freeman's son, across the street got shot, now she need a hand!""
Traumatized, God oh why's his momma cry
Now I gotta look up, up in his momma eyes, gotta tell this momma lies

And I know it's so much pain, and there's probably more on the way

You know I love you momma like she mine
Whether we together, or we trying
We fuck, three times, we smoke, tree times
We climb, I left, came back in town, it wasn't in time
The cancer done came, it just hit it's prime
It came from the breast, just spread to the spine
It might make her blind, she stare at the blinds:
""This can't be my mom!""
Got me thinking, ""whats a girl to do, a girl to do?
When her world's a pool?
And she comes up for air, and it's walls of flames
And all the stress is all propane
She's burned again""
Hoping I could make her smile
Take cancer and David Blaine it out

There's a few million angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again

Only real niggas so I know that you still gon' be absent
I feel like I'm the black Brad Pitt
When I wake up to fuckin' an actress
We just shot a movie last night on the couch
And I swear that that shit is a classic
If I want it, I need it, I need it, I have it, hit so much it's a habit
I'm greedy, I'm greedy, man fuck it, I'm greedy
Her titties so big that I nicknamed them DeeDee
I know that the devil is callin'
Man fuck that weak-ass nigga, let it keep ringin'
Right now I'm connected with Jesus, on threeway with Yeezus
We just signed a treaty, I'm on the couch like ""Free my niggas!""
But niggas cannot get a freebie
If I'm in the field then you know that I TD
Overtime, all the time, man I repeat it
I need some good pussy and Posturepedic
Stressin' so hard think my hairline receded
I say how I say and I feel how I feel
And I won't take it back, it's no need to recede it
You stuck on a bitch?
Well I stuck to the script all my life, ain't no need to re-read it
If you got my email, you's a millionaire
If you got my cellphone, you's a realionare
I ain't been home in months but bitch I'm still the mayor

I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Intro]
I do It
For the city, man

[Verse 1]
Feeling like I got the cheat code to life
Jewelry looking like it got free-throwed in ice
Debating with the Reaper not to repo my life
Cause in my 23 years I've lived a couple lives
Like why? Cause I stunt? Bag the tree like it's fall?
The girls that was out of my league trying to play with my balls
I pay bills, I work hard, and when my mama cried a river
They never gave us a bridge, they gave us a bridge card
Nigga riding low, puffing on loud
I came way too far to fuck it up now
Text from my mom said ""Me and your grandma proud""
I'm way too deep in the game to go sit back in the crowd
Teacher told me to get a job, save up for 401(K)
Man, I'd rather be young as shit counting 401k
I'd rather die with a smile instead
I'm just multiplying my money and dividing the legs
[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

[Verse 2]
But I'm never dividing the bread
Bitch, I bet I get the debit if I don't get the cred I deserve
Throwing West side up like Pac up
Where they pop your block up, b-blocka big poppa flock off
You holy lil' whoaty holy kenobi chewbacca
I'm Balenciaga, Chanel, Hermes but I bet you that you won't find it
Rockin' Louis and MCM, I guess I'm clothes-minded
Obama suite, you one below up in the Joe Biden
I'm in your city just chilling where all your hoes hiding?
20k for the fit because it's 24 carats
I can't lie, the price'll probably go up when I wear it
I'm just D-town repping
Making all these niggas who second-guessed regret it
Regret it like half the hoes I smashed in the sheets
At least I realize now how much I love Ashley Marie
And when it's all said and done, I'll probably get on my knee
Cause she put up with too many games not to have her a ring
Man, she almost cried when she seen me on TV on BET
Just making it seem easy! Standing next to Common Sense and Yeezy

[Chorus]
I been this way before (And the whole world see me)
Dreamed of havin' so much more (Bitch I know you see me)
[Verse 3]
Man, I wake up to a wet dream
Every day's a Friday and every night's a sex scene
Every week is Fashion Week and every day I'm pressed clean
Detroit's angel, I even got red wings
Headed to the ball, me and three prom queens
It's prom night, and guess who's the prom king?
They having a kissing fight and I'm Don King
Everybody know I'm coming soon like Lebron's ring
Tell me that wasn't the verse of the year
Man, that shit deserves a hearse and a tear
Swear to God I'm overlaid, all my girls get overfucked
All my deals be overpaid and all my joints be overstuffed
Finally Famous bitch, there ain't a fucking thing that's over us
So take that check out and owe it up! Man, I turn impossible possible
And what these niggas could barely see into optimal
The same teacher who told me rap is what not to do
Said I'm throwing my life away, if I drop out of school
Want me to come speak to the kids, the point I gotta prove
Is that I did everything they told me not to do
After I went down the road they told me not to cruise
They ain't know that was my road to success
Now my picture on the wall hanging to help the kids follow through
My dream girl is every night, my dream car is optional
My old school look like a T-Rex: I should feed her fossil fuels
Man, I turn my enemies to molecules, lil' hoes
Without any preparation, I exceed these expectations
Man they wanna see me dead, but I gave 'em dedication
And I'm yelling fuck 'em all with a hundred exclamations
Cause I'ma be the man til my fucking expiration
[Chorus]
I been this way before
Dreamed of havin' so much more

Westside to be exact, right over there on Northlawn

Come roll with a nigga, get high with a nigga
Count stacks with a nigga, fuck hoes with a nigga
Back in high school we used to trade clothes with my niggas
Back when Iceberg and Girbaud
Was like the wardrobe for the killers, we pose for the pictures
Stunting on hoes, I stunt with my bros
Real go-getters, I swear being broke didn't fit us
Like new T-shirts, new jeans, new hats
You know, spending gas money on everything except gas
Spending my last on the shit that won't last
Back when 20 dollars would impress that ass
A movie and popcorn and caress that ass
Overdress to undress that ass, god bless that ass
It was me and my dawgs, summer on summer
Riding around like we dumber on dumber
Whipping that Toyota like it's a Hummer
What happened to those days? I really do wonder
When all I did was safe sex, latex
The first time I slipped up, wished I had a homemade AIDS test fuck
But I ain't flunk once
Back before I got drunk once
I was smoking on haze, all in a daze
My homies would call and say, ""nigga, come roll""

[Break 1]
The D grown us to get it man. You know what I’m mean? Just hustle, hustle, hustle. They, you know we, you know, there really wasn’t that much opportunity for us, man. So, we just had to let our nuts hang and just, shit, boss up and, and learn the game
[Verse 2]
Man, I'm straight up off the 7 Mile, they call that the better mile
Tryna get a house up in the woods off on 11 Mile, bet it now
One time for the D, Girls that hold me down Corretta style
Free Juan, let him out
And everything I want off in the world is a must-have
I realised that at the bus stop with a bus pass thinking ""fuck rap""
Cause there's niggas in the streets
Getting money under my nose that I must stash
I've seen people get murked who ain't deserved that shit
Cops should've protect-and-served and shit
But still pull me over, disrespect and search my shit
Ask ""why the attitude?"" cause bitch, you deserve that shit
Bang bang bang, how do you maintain
A sane brain and mind in a city of AKs and K9s?
When only language they know English and gang signs
Fuck it all though, I'm repping till the world blow, come roll

[Break 2]
Well shit, I’m just, you know, I’m proud of lil' bro man. That nigga listened and he was able to stay focused man and through all the adversity man and through all the hood politics. But he seen it, he was with it, he was on it, you know? I mean like I say the Linwood man, shit that’s what we know the city man, that’s for the city man all fucking day

And all this champagne that I'm popping
Reminded me that I'm winning

[Verse 3: Wale & Big Sean]
Boy, hold your head but guard your heart
Got tired of white silence, so the riots started
And the robbers robbed, you wylin' 'cause yo' product gone?
We mad that Eric Garner, Breonna, Gianna father gone
Yeah, a lot of trauma, we tired, exhausted
Ermias the prophet said it'd be a marathon, look
Seen all my dawgs shown me God was watchin' (Woah)
Pandemic slowin' 'em down, they fastin', Ramadan
The land of fifty stars, on Hollywood marchin'
White friends don't got us, I promise you, I'll block 'em (Straight up)
I'ma count my bread, I defied the odds
And fuck the Saint quarterback 'cause he ain't Saint Laurent
Boy, from here on out, we on Pyer Moss
If we leave Reebok, we still bring 'em pumps and all the broads
Yeah, I motivate (I motivate), I don't divide (I don't divide)
The 45 a coward for practicing otherwise
A burnt nation, still it's under God
Not gonna throw the towel in, I'm by my brother's side
Your niggas be yo' niggas when you level up
You see that yo' niggas and brothers different when luck is up
So I trust nothing, this industry's something
My biggest rival is my mind protecting my thoughts
As well as my heart

[Chorus: Earlly Mac]
It's fifty niggas deep, hundred niggas step
Million Man March, cracker, don't you start
Hold yo' head, guard yo' heart
Hold yo' head, uh

Sometimes I dream bigger than I live
Sometimes I think better when I’m lit
So go on and light it
Roll it up, ignite it
One time for all my niggas that dreamed it than real life’d it
I swear I’ve been through everything in life but a coffin
They say sky’s the limit, how bitch?
I’m moonwalking
And my middle name Michael, ho
Success is my idol and being broke is my rival
But it’s cool because I got the title, ho
See I just want my fantasies in real life
You got everything tell me what it feel like
Motherfuck the radio if I can’t hear mine
They give the wrong people more airtime than airlines
Is you feeling me?
If not you feel my energy
See I know I’ma make it, but even if I don’t
Don’t feel bad cause honestly all these times that I had
Those will be the best memories

[Refrain: John Legend & Big Sean]
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me
Reflect on everything we missed
Cause you know we'll never get it back
These will be the best memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
Cause in the end all you really have is memories
Woah woah, woah-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, the memories
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Are you willing to give up what you love, for who you love
Or lose your girlfirend to groupie love
Everywhere I go I get a group of hugs
That's what happens when they need connections and you the plug
How many trends you gotta set til you considered great?
How many missed calls til you considered fake?
How many dreams til it's considered fate?
I’m eating in a world where I’m considered bait
A workaholic addicted to bills
People addicted to me cause they addicted to real
My best friend got addicted to pills
I can’t look at him in his eyes
You don’t know how that shit feels mentally
I ain't trying to rock no shirts that say in memory
I’m praying that he make it, wishing we could go back
Cause honestly all the times that we had
Those will be the best memories

[Refrain: John Legend & Big Sean]

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Sometimes reality checks are too big to be cashed
Mailed one when I heard Unique had died in that crash
Seems like yesterday I just seen her smile and laugh
I'm stressing over little shit
When I should be happy I can
They say my music beating, cause I follow my heart
I always have faith, light will swallow the dark
Hurtin' with my Mama looking at cribs we can't purchase
Houses bigger than the Palace
But she a queen, so she deserve it
So I'm focused, they try to throw me off track
But they just hurdles, I'm marathoning
To the money and you just running off in a circle
I'm huddled up with my team, in other words my inner circle
Fast forward a few years later
Now we the fucking winner's circle
Remember the first time I was rhyming for Kan
Almost as nervous as the first time I rhymed for my mom
Sold out the theater downtown, she said it was perfect
But I already dreamed it
So it felt like I rehearsed it
Much as my grandma took care of me since I was birthed
Sad I used to steal twenty dollar bill right out her purses
No I ain't perfect, tryna make a gift out of a curse
Life out of a hearse
And if I die first then I have the memories
[Refrain: John Legend & Big Sean]
Let's reminisce on the good times and the bad
Be the best memories
I hope that you remember me

[Verse]
Man, this one for the ones who hold me down so we forever on the rise
Long as I got charts, it's never me, myself & I
Straight up, champagne
Man this one for the ones who cop the album and they ain't need a receipt
All the internet plumbers, you know looking for the leaks
Been trying to find middle ground, like yellow lines in the street
This show is just getting started, don't worry man take a seat
I got mom and bro around like whats better than the family
Did a show at House of Blues that shit was better than the Grammy's
On the phone with my dad trying to handle whats out of hand
Reminiscing we used to play 5-on-5, no hand to hands (ballin)
Funny man what all those times meant to us
Girls ask me why they call me big, that shit ambiguous
Rappers who was killin shit, lately I can't feel that shit
Ya'll used to didn't feel my shit and now ya'll like ""you hear this shit?""
Detroit niggas, say whats up doe, where I be
Fresh as my nigga IB, what up to Don C
The most improved player, watch me turn that I to a V
On my third LP but by the time its IV
That's the fourth, don't be surprised if I'm in first with high leads
We came a long way from having hands together like God Please
Do I really gotta emphasize, my mind spaced out
Yeah I call that bitch the enterprise
I hop up on the song with Em, Jay, and K, watch me hold my own
Bitch it's Sean
Verses standing out like it close at 10 o'clock and its 10:05
Oh boy, I spit that spiritual
Yeah I'm the underdog but Underdog was a superhero too
And my city going through hell, they need a miracle too
You're more about showing off, I'm more about show and prove
Ya'll braggin about so and so, like ""Oh, he really it?
The new nigga in rap? Well, can he really spit?""
Or do he just hide behind his skits like half of these rappers do
And then ya'll fucking go and praise him and his bitch like they savior of this shit
I'm like ""Aw, man. Here we go""
I'm not the same man I was a year ago
I learned that life could be a merry-go
Moving at a stand still is the scenario
I also learned some girls can fit the stereotype if they got a stereo
Crazy what a cold bitch'll do for palm trees
Type that can't hold my hand even if they palm read
Got a good girl at home, yeah that's all me
I gave my number out on the outro I'm like ""call me"", real nigga
Since they cut my umbilical, I pass weed in my physical
Yeah my woman is vegan, she got my ass trying different food
I got her listenin to music that she wouldn't listen to
Got her vibin to Nas, she like ""Man, This what I been missin, boo?""
I'ma do what I didn't do, all the ridicule is just fuel
I'ma take this little profit, I gotta flip it, no reciprocal
Nigga, fuck open arms, nigga open the safe
Respect in this bitch like  a gun on my waist
Rappin like I got a gun in my face
I treat my life like I be runnin a race
Supa Dupa flow, up up and away
You at the top, well I'm on the way
I'ma come for your spot then I cum in your face
I been trying to make I gotta have it to a habit
Addicted to the mathematics, I'ma add-it addict
Beware of the niggas who abandon when your shit was abandoned
But there for the mansion
Then hit after hit after hit
Somebody tell me what's the fuckin batting average
Dark Sky Paradise, you niggas can have it
Clique rainin so hard, you can white water raft it

Man, we just fucking around, man

We was in three different cities today, man

Getting to the paper like it's human nature
Goddamn, the more they hate us, that just motivate us
I know revenge tastes the sweetest, mmm, I'm gon' savor
I'm just sending all my graces up to my creator
No negotiation, this is world domination
You can fill the trophy cases up with nominations
I'm the Alpha-Omega, that mean you can't replace us
That mean I'm throwing dice in Vegas, betting all the wages
My girl expensive, remember you get what you pay for
Big, big pay-off moves on and off the radar
You can't afford to miss a layup when you in the playoffs (Uh)
Press on, stress on
I give this shit blood, flesh, bone
Can't catch me, I skate to my destiny
That's necessity, you can't out-finesse me
She like chocolate, Nestlé, brown and sexy
Touch me, tease me, please me, just don't test me
I'm the bar, my weight up, you can't press me
Legendary bloodline, my ancestry
Ooh, I'm devoted and hated, I re-coded the Matrix
I just loaded the bases and you know I'ma make it hit

I've been having conversations with the constellations
We keep this shit between us, just like a doctor-patient
The heaviest intoxication make the problems weightless
I'ma need some sanitation for the time that's wasted
Told my shrink that life is crazy, he said, ""Life is crazy""
I bought a house so fucking big it feel like I'm my neighbors
I told my weed man, ""I need nature,"" he accommodate me
I got two choppers look alike, I call 'em crock and gator
The flowers looking quite amazing, I ain't like the fragrance
I stand beside a baby, see who you decide to play with
I'ma take my fucking chances, I'm a lucky bastard
My heart race 'til it catch up to who it's running after
Oh my gosh, I'm gone, I'm on a planet I'm not knowin'
Said, ""Let there be light,"" but then all my lights were blown
Yeah, I know my rights, I mean I know right from wrong
I know yayo white and sweeter than a yellow bone
I know love is life and I know life is never long
I made plans to get away and in the morning, I'll be gone

I had a dream I died at thirty nigga
Aw, twenty something doing real life
To make a million dollars, what it feel like?
It feel like I need to know her right then
It feel like young Ray Allen with the white twins
Popping harder than MJ with the white skin
I take you way back, I'm talking Tommy Hilfiger
Wave cap, way back
Back when we said we need the wrist rocky, ASAP
I had the Casio, time to replace that
Don't make me snap back, back to the TI$A  snapback
Khaled with the flow, you know, they don't want you to snap, yep
Don't make me get the car seat, niggas know I'm they pap, pap
Boy they owe it to me like Leonardo DiCap, facts, yep
Look fresh out of debt, getting spoiled rich
And I'm just tryna spend it all with a loyal bitch
I been choosing wrong girls my whole life
I hope I don't fail the test again
And have her going through my texts again
Religiously, like it's the old testament
Then end up single alone, and stressed again, saying...

Look, thinking to my self what true success is
To some it's to get a job, retire, and move to Texas
I take the path less travelled and give them new directions
I'm still taking more risks than I do suggestions
When I was young I was addicted to the Wrestlemania
Maybe cause I had my back against the ropes
And I grew up Stone Cold just ready to face the Undertaker
I treat my enemies like fuckin' neighbors
Yeah you can borrow the style, and this and that for a while
But trust, I'll be back to fuckin' take it
Then take it back to before it all started adding up
Back when it was happening but wasn't happening fast enough
And the job applications was the only papers stackin' up
And we was contemplating black-masking out the back of trucks, yup
Do you know how it feel, to have no chill?
And love super thick girls with a supermodel feel
And try and do it bigger than everyone around you ever did and ever will
Then put it in your will
It ain't about where you at, boy, it's about where your mind's at
Got my first job and realized I need two hundred times that

Bout' to start a bank, all this money that I make
Sour diesel smoking, Memphis nigga getting paid
Bunch of bad bitches, beggin' Juice to fuck
Drinking 'til I throw up, smoking 'til I'm stuck
Loud kush, you can hear it when I walk by
The room is moving side to side, I'm feeling hypnotized
Getting faded in the Phantom, ain't no stopping a riot
These niggas smoking dirt, actin' like they high

Swear that my texting is no longer legible

Tell her to leave and come bring me back revenue
Gettin' paid down down down to the decimal
Medical vegetable, I'm so professional
My life's a fesitval, I'm just so messed up though - in the mental
I feel like I just jumped out the window
Rollin' OG, kush, purp and indo
Right here, outdoor, in the endo

Okay, so now we rollin', and she just popped her a pilly
Got her feeling all silly, rollin' paper from Philly, whoa

For the handbag livin', Saks Fifth'n, tag rippin'

Tequila glasses (Whoa)
Shots to the head, 'cause some memories they need assassins
Got a quarter pound of purp, an eighth of gin and half my friends
Gone, gone, man, fuck it though, not too good with fractions
Tried to do it all on my own, not too good with asking
'Cause when people give you a hand they want an audience back
But they not clapping and standing, they clapping at me let's panic
Pop, pop that AK take candids
I aim for the sky, never landed
And yup
I look up up up in the mirror, I see a nigga gettin' rich off me
Hmm, and look at all these mother fuckers tryna get rich off me
But they wasn't there not when times got heavy man when things got deadly
Before my cash flow broke that levy man we ain't have no heat in that broke ass Chevy
Coming from a city where dreams get shredded, I'm goin' off credit, these niggas need debit
Made mistakes but they made me what I am and I am what I am and I don't regret it
And I found the girl that I'd marry, the only curse
Is that I keep running into the girls that I'd fuck first
[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all? For everything you love and more, would you trade it all?
I mean a, big house, life you never saw, for everything you want and love, would you trade it all?
Would you trade it all?
For everything you know, are you down to let it go?
Fuck nah
Trynna make it out a city where niggas don't make it out
And if you do they want the blueprint so they can try and trace it out
They got that work, and thank God for yay
Signed to G.O.O.D, thank God for Ye
Before it's all said and done the one thing that I gotta say is

[Chorus]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I made mistakes but I'm just man enough to say
There's no turning back now

[Verse 2]
Man I miss my grandma, she ain't passed away or nothin', I'm just busy on camera
I love her, I love her, I should call her up and tell her
Give her some flowers, while she can still smell em
While she can still smell em, If you love somebody please tell em
I swear if you had 24 hours tell me who or what you'd do
Would you spend it all with your fam or would you get high with your crew?
Would you go back to your old girl and let her know that it's true?
Would you go back to your old boss and piss all over his shoes?
Would you, try and make the news? Would you get paid? Would you try to pay your dues?
Would you step it up or would you try and change shoes? Do you believe in karma or living for tomorrow?
Would you, hit the bar and go binging? Would you, steal a car, Mercedez Benz? and
Would you die alone, would you die independent? Or would have your friends right there in attendance
When it's all finished
Guess that depends on how you live
Just pray that all of your wrongs don't overshadow all that you did
[Bridge]
But that's the, lifestyle of the big big dogs
For everything you love and want, would you trade it all?

How bout I just take your city make that muthaf-cker mine uh ha
I’m a underground king ho, I sit tall, I swang low
The game ain't always fair and thats the thing though
You can play your heart out everyone don’t get a ring though
You are in the presence of a champion
Bout to get a condo that I can fit your mansion in
You always be calling her, she ain’t never answering
You ain’t figured out I am the reason that she canceling
I be at the parties where you stuck outside and can’t come in

Married to the music so I never give a hand a ring
But Chiddy jigga with these girls we be on the next
And they get mad cause we really don’t respond to text

You need a good guy and I'm already not one

Sometimes last words can have the worst ending
Wish we could fast forward time and reverse feelings

When it was her last night, nigga, and me today
You the man, huh? Getting all the TNA
You fucking her raw too, sharing our DNA?

Bad bitch, chest out
No wonder why Mrs. Right just keeps on getting left out
Oh well that's everything I'm not concerning, fuck it
I'm on the top floor getting brains, higher learning
Getting higher earnings and my desires yearning
Running through that paper like my attorney
Hundred blunts rolled, you can smell the fire burning
I'm in the fast lane, you can smell my tires burning
Exercise, flex on guys
Model chick
Sex on thighs
Bump a lot
A Lexus drive
I might let Alexis drive
Jesus chain, testify
I over accessorize
Test her out, now she gon' need a stretcher when I stretch her out
When it's time to speak, bet all of ya'll listen
When you up in the party
Why is all the broads missing
And I just drop lines like a nigga gone fishing
Man and I be on them posters like that nigga gone missin'
And I spit that er-retarded shit just call it autism
I'm so Hollywood that I might make your bitch audition
Before we cut
Cut, cut
Movie time, cut
I'ma dick her down, you gon' pick her up
And I'm unusual as shit
I'm Superbad, your girl probably doodling my dick
And it's a couple screws up in my head that could use a fucking wrench
And I'm just looking at the game like
Damn, they could use a fucking bench, bitch
And my name all up in the rafters
She gon' make me cum, I bet that money come faster
Kanye first, then I'm coming after
And Lou' Vuitton shoes ho
Dons and the Jaspers
Who her, I ran through her walls
Made her scream and disappear but hell no my name is not Casper
Boy, what the fuck these rappers sound like
Just a whole bunch of my sound bites
First whip, garbo
Second whip, Largo
Don’t worry bout my niggas Thurgood Marshall
Bank account got me feeling Well, Fargo
Balling til I get a Milicic Darko
I did that
I just give them line after line, after line
After line, after line barcode
They looking for my work, Narco
Cause I just black out in the booth, charcoal
Me, Don C, Tone and fifty-four bitches
Since we finna blow, I bet they finna blow nigga
Two pounds of weed, don't act like you don't know nigga
I put that green up, like mistletoe nigga
[Outro]
Yeah boy, boy boy
Finally Famous in this, getting money

My hands dirty, my gross up (gross), my money doing the toe touch
That’s stretched out, ‘til I’m in the back, stretched out, drinkin' Ace

Lately, I been getting like mo’ ass and less mouth
‘Cause when they see that whip (skrrt), they start to think about kids
Man, when they see this crib, they gon’ start to think about cribs
Been dealt with real life too long, now it’s time to live
Respect out the D (boi), hardly had a pot to pee in

Now I been killing shit, I gotta say, my pit blue, my buffs gray
With a hint of white, sipping Henny white, livin' like I won’t see the night
A real playa like Pinky, when I’m in the game, I TD
And I’m all about my dollars, dollars, dollars, that’s 3D
I wake up with a bad bitch by my side
Last night, I was so drunk, I felt high
Last week, I was so high, I felt drunk
I got a bitch so bad, I gotta hit from the front
I fuck Kim K hoes, that’s Ye ‘Ye tone, smoking weed, that’s reggaeton
Get it next to free, that’s AJ tone, what’s my name

Looking at the city that raised me

And go get everything they never gave me
[Verse 3: Earlly Mac]
Like every day that I wake, I say grace for my cake
I’ma do dessert first, I don’t even gotta wait
Yea, when I hit the mall, I hit that bitch in the face
God be so good to me, I just gotta stop and pray
By the way, my jewelry appraised, it’s a couple K
On the lake, I’m out of the state, at my hideaway
Like Bruce Wayne, I’m saving the day, and I’m getting bank
I’m foolay, my bitch got bootay, ooh I love the way
I woke up, my dough up, I got out, I go nuts
I show out, I blow up, I ball out, I pro up
Ok it’s Earlly Mac off in this ho, tailor-made designer coat
Watch me take it to the bank and deposit a pot of gold
I’m foolay

Today is a good day
I wish a nigga would day
Ride through the hood day
Ride through the hood where I would stay
If I wasn’t me, wasn’t committed
I told my mom and my dad it’ll be the last Christmas
In the hood that you can visit
Oh boy I got it, no chasers
Cause the best mixed with Hennessey is problems
I took that advice young when I was headed up to college
Momma swimming in that debt
Rather swim with the piranhas or the shark
Ready set go, on your mark to the top
Getting rich ain’t a blessing it’s a choice
Drunk and still drinking out the fucking bottle
I want a hood rat bitch motherfuck a model
You ain't alive if you ain't living that’s the motto

Re-up time for every penny, never fronted
Showroom floor, paid every penny then I stunted
Stunted so hard you woulda thought I was a stuntman
TS4 with 23’s I’m talking jumpmans
Twos and thirds watch for the blitz, you know they rush
Just don’t get caught in the coupe with them birds, end of discussion
Them boys round the corner wanna sell in that Cal Ripken
If them niggas think I’m riding with that, them niggas tripping
Yeah I got a magnificent hustle, cause’ imma’ grinder
Told my O's, ""I'm hiding you here, so they won’t find you""
What you know about a bag that’s heavy as anacondas?
Bet you one thing, I ain’t talking no marijuana
That’s whats wrong with these niggas they think it’s about shine
You niggas get back to your grind, I think it’s about time

They say it’s my time according to my Rolex
I’m bout to fuck the game, then your ho next
I used to talk dirty on my cell, no phone sex
No yoga boy I was making blow stretch
Press the fast forward button, I’m pushing a foreign something
All through my neighborhood, next stop is the haters hood
My bitch so bad, but you can bet that my paper good
I do this for real, you lil niggas just fake it good
It’s time for a new crib, it’s time for a new chain
20 thousand on me homie that’s just loose change
Too many diamond chains that nigga a mess
But if you knew bout my hood you’d say that nigga is blessed
Detroit in this bitch, Big Sean what it do bro?
Getting money four ways so I can buy a two-door
Stash looking healthy but my jewelry got the flu though

Detroit, once the backbone of this country
Now it’s the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy
Thriving neighborhoods are now vacant
Going from a population of nearly 2 million
To under 700,000 in a matter of years

To make it through these tough times5Embed"

Ho, I got my cell phone ringin', nowadays it's hard to get me
Nine times out of ten, if you ballin' then you busy
Sippin' Henney, sippin' Rémy like it's Chrissy
And I pop that champagne like it's my birthday, really it's a Wednesday
All about the benjis, I've been gone all year
Came back, I swear you niggas ain't done moved an inch or centi
Mind movin' like a semi, pop pop pop, the truth is
I feel like masseuses when I back off in this bitch, I feel the tension
Ho, you've got your hand out, what that mean, like gimmie?
What you need your ass, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys
I know thug ass niggas that'll run in your house
You lock the door, you lock the window, they gon' come down the chimney
Skinny nigga but I walk inside this bitch like Dikimbe
I'm the Laurent St., I keep a angel face with me
You got your hand out, ho, again, what that mean, like gimme?
What you need you, a penny? Better off askin' for kidneys
If a bitch don’t suck my dick, I swear that shit just offend me
Ho, I'm really from Detroit, I went to Cass and not Renni
Actin' like you can't die tonight, what, you gon' come back like Kenny?
I roll up spazzin' like Timmy, hand is attached to the benjis

[Hook x2]
Atta-tached to the benjis, not attached to these feelings
I don't love these hoes, I'd rather fuck me a million, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it
If I said it, I mean it

[Verse 2]
Nigga, I be the most imitated, my crib renovated
My old bitch assessin', my new bitch is waitin'
Just like a doctor with my operation
I got me my check-up but still got no patience
All of these texts and calls I'm not takin'
My phone overflowin', that shit can get drainin'
I signed up with Ye, and he just explained it
How we gotta get it like Jay-Z and Damon
Did back in the year that they came in
Stuck between a ROC and the G.O.O.D. place is where I'm remainin'
Bitch, it's finally famous
What you do in a day I could do before breakfast
Young nigga T-rexing
My old bitch wish that she would've got pregnant
Tryna be the first lady because my wrist just won a presidential election
Bitch, and I hope you offended
I said it, I meant it, I hope that recorded
I just broke a Guinness
I flew in from Italy through the Pacific
Shout out to Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Scott Disick
When you see my pretty face, shut the fuck up and kiss it
And just know that my hands

There’s no romancin' without the pain
Just like there's no loss without some gain

And all the late nights you been wishin' (Finally pay off)
Finally pay off and go the distance

I'm ’bout to delete my Twitter and follow my intuition
Been in and out the mud, but somеhow I'm in mint condition
I wonder if Granddad would have seen thesе Instagram vixens
Every fifteen minutes, would he had did everything that he did or he didn't?
I wonder how it feel to be rappin'
Swear that’s my fuckin' passion, how it feel to go platinum?
Swear that's my dream, but he too blind to see that
If he doin' what he love in his freetime, then his dream already happened
It's not about the trophy, it's about what it took to grab it
And if you feelin' stagnant, just know you attractin' the energy
That you put out there, you a walkin' magnet
Life can be a struggle, but what isn't that's worth havin'? Huh?

New life start with a blank canvas
Tryna find yourself, you moved to Lost Angeles
Where the camera's off, you're still not off camera
And that meeting that's supposed to change your life keep getting canceled
Swear my prayers gon' get answered 'fore these execs'll answer
Shit, expenses get too expensive
But you gon' do what it takes to do the digits
Even do the dishes
'Cause you gotta prove to the world how you committed
You got a whole city to inspire
It's so cold in the D, so through they eyes, you on fire
Going platinum once like catching lightning in a bottle
But you do it fifty times
And you realize contracts say a lot between the lines
But through the ups and downs, you make a blueprint that the city can build they own way out
And when they do, it's gon' feel like that you almost did it
And you buy everything you want, but it barely make you different
And find out random bitches can't even compare to commitment
And you learn hearin' doubts doesn't mean you have to listen
And you can't believe how much you made, not money, a difference
And find out everything you had was everything you missin'11Embed"

Maybe Malaysia to escape through meditation
I'll just eat, pray, and wait for my day of revelation, or I'll—
Take peyote, roam the rivers of Nairobi
Change my name to ""Navajo"" and live alone and only grow weed
'Cause this Naomi-flowing show gets pretty lonely
Don't nobody ever know you, everybody call you homie, ugh
Mo-ney, mo-ney, they'll be sure to treat you phony
As soon as you hit your low, they won't be picking up the phone, see
I move with calm to show these fools that I am home
And when I'm on the microphone, all you wannabes can blow me, so
Take this boner to the dome, you little Bo Peeps
That may be inapprop-y but I'm certain-a-ly no sheep, see
I only lead in this game of entertainment
Roth and Big Sean, we on, Finally Famous

[Verse 6: King Chip]
Yeah, now roll ten of 'em up
Fuck the rules, we Auntie Anne's pretzel-bending 'em up
Don't give a fuck, word to your daddy leather sandals
Either pay the light bill or light up them candles
Regular White Owl cigarillo, no flavors
Break that bitch down and peel off the first layer
Smooth, like a baby's ass, Mercedes pass
The ladies ask, ""Can they be next?"" 'cause I'm kicking their favorite raps
Life is playing 2K and kicking raps all day by the lake
Smoking tree 'til I collapse in broad-day
I'm surfing, radical, gnarly, far out
My stoner chicks gather 'round soon as I break the jar out
Ayy, baby girl, pass the blizz-ard
Your woman chose me, so I had to jizz her
Don't be sleeping or taking no cat naps
We leaders of the new school with these fat raps, niggaEmbed"
