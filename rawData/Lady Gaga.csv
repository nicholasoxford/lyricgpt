[Verse 1]
I'm not a wandering slave, I am a woman of choice
My veil is protection for the gorgeousness of my face
You ought to pity me 'cause was arranged one man to love
But in the bedroom, the size of him's more than enough

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the aura, behind the aura?
[Verse 2]
Enigma popstar is fun, she wear burqa for fashion
It's not a statement as much as just a move of passion
I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil
I hear you screaming, is it because of pleasure or toil?

[Bridge]
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech
Dance, sex, art, pop, tech

[Chorus]
Do you wanna see me naked, lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura, behind the aura?
Do you wanna touch me, cosmic lover?
Do you wanna peek underneath the cover?
Do you wanna see the girl who lives behind the aura?
Behind the aura, behind the curtain, behind the burqa

Sometimes a story has no end
Sometimes I think that we could just be friends
""'Cause I'm a wandering man,"" he said to me
""And what about the future plans?
Does this thing we have even makes sense
When I got the whole world in front of me?""
So, I said...

[Chorus 1]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

[Verse 2]
So I just packed my baggage, and
Said goodbye to family and friends
And took a road to nowhere on my own
Like Dorothy on a yellow brick
Hope my ruby shoes get us there quick
'Cause I left everyone I love at home
[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be tonight
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I love gypsy life
I don't wanna be alone forever
Maybe we can see the world together
I don't wanna be alone forever, but I can be
Tonight!
Tonight!

And then he asked me, he said
""Baby, why do we love each other?""
I said, ""Honey, it's simple
It's the way that you love and treat your mother.""

[Chorus]
Thought that I would be alone forever, but I won't be tonight
I'm a man without a home, but I think with you, I could spend my life
And you'll be my little gypsy princess
Pack your bags and we can chase the sunset
Bust the rearview and fire up the jets
'Cause it's you and me
Baby, for life (If you go with me)
For life (See the world with me)

I could have said goodbye
I would have said what I wanted to
Maybe even cried for you
If I knew it would be the last time

Tryin' to save a part of you

Don't want to know another kiss

Won't even let the sunlight in
No I'll never love again
I'll never love again

I never thought that I would fall
I never thought that I'd find myself lyin' in your arms

Got you drippin' like no other

Gets on the brink, and throws her off

When I look back on my life it’s not that I don’t want to see things exactly as they happened, it’s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way. And truthfully the lie of it all is much more honest because I invented it. Clinical psychology tells us arguably that trauma is the ultimate killer. Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality

For example those nurses, they're wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti. I tipped their gause caps to the side like Parisian berets because I think it's romantic, and I also think that mint will be very big in fashion next spring

Check out this nurse on the right; she's got a great ass. Bam

The truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. I'd wish they'd only given me the gummy bears

""The Prelude Pathétique""- Last Part:
You may say ""I lost everything"". But I still had my Be-Dazzler. And I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M&J Trimming. So I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do; I did it all over again4Embed"

Nowhere, yeah, we’re goin' nowhere fast
Maybe this time, I’ll be yours, you’ll be mine
C-c-c-crazy (Crazy), get your ass in my bed
Baby, you’ll be just my summer boyfriend (Summerboy)

[Chorus]
Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone
Bikini top’s comin' o-o-off
Don’t be sad when the sun goes down
You’ll wake up, and I’m not around
I’ve got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after all
Ooh!

[Verse 2]
Sometimes you might start a fight
But I’m happy pretending we're alright
Sunglasses cover up my green eyes
My martini glistens, yeah, while checking out other guys (Summerboy)

Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice, we can be alone

Hey there, Summerboy, let’s go for a drive
Take me for a ride, never gonna close our eyes
Hey there, Summerboy, I’m a busy girl
Don’t got too much time, hurry up before I change my mind
Hey there, Summerboy, I’m taking off my heels
Let’s go for a run, have a little summer fu-u-un
Have a little summer fu-u-un

You’ll wake up, and I’m not around
You've got to go, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’ll still have the summer after
Let’s get lost, you can take me home
Somewhere nice we can be alone
I've got my summer-summerboy

Oh, tonight I'm gonna show them what I'm made of, oh
The killer queen inside me's coming to say ""hello""
Oh, tonight I will return
The fame and riches earned
With you, I'd watch them all be burned
Woah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

[Chorus]
I can be the queen that's inside of me
This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see
I can be, the queen you need me to be
This is my chance to be the dance
I've dreamed, it's happening
I can be the queen

[Verse 2]
I am wind and hurricane, the stormy sky and rain
When you run dry, I'll flood your pain
Woah, woah
In between the moments of the lady I've become
A voice speaks through the noise like drums
Rum-pum-pum-pum
[Pre-Chorus]
Whenever I start feeling strong
I'm called a bitch in the night
But I don't need these 14 karat guns to win
I am a woman, I insist, it's my life

This is my chance to release
And be brave for you, you'll see

Starry night
Come inside me, like never before
Don't forget me when I come crying to Heaven's door
I will fly
On a challenger across the sky
Like a phoenix, so you can remind them of the dream I bore

I need you to listen to me, please believe me
I'm completely lonely, please don't judge me
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall
I need you to listen to me, please don't leave me
I'm not perfect yet, but I'll keep trying
When your tears are falling, I'll catch them as they fall

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause inside, we are really made the same
In life, waiting's just a stupid game

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves

[Post-Chorus]
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves
Flying like a thousand, flying like two thousand
Flying like ten thousand doves

[Verse 2]
I'd do anything if you would just believe me
I am human, invisibly bleeding
When your smile is shaking, I'll catch you as you fall
If I had a painter's mind, then I would paint it
Or a sculptor's hands, then I would shape it
But instead, I guess I'll sing it in this song
[Pre-Chorus]
I cry more than I ever sang
Each time, your love seems to save the day

[Chorus]
Lift me up, give me a start
'Cause I've been flying with some broken arms
Lift me up, just a small nudge
And I'll be flying like a thousand doves
