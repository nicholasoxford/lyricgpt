Doesn't make sense now
Shit just got real, things are gettin' intense now
I hear you talkin' 'bout ""We"" a lot, oh, you speak French now?
Giving me the signs so I gotta take a hint now
I hit you up like ""Do you wanna hang right now?""
On the East Side and you know I'm with the gang right now
You say do I own a watch, do I know what time it is right now
It's after 2AM and that's askin' a lot of you right now

[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she ever say is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I been up for two whole days thinkin' what I did to keep you goin'
Thumbin' through the voicemails that you left me tellin' me where I went wrong
I'll admit I'm sorry when I feel I'm truly sorry
Things change, people change, feelings change too
Never thought the circumstances woulda changed you
You said you never traded, no (Yeah, you said that)
And I believed you when they told me don't
(Yeah, I thought you meant that)
But either way you're still invited and I can't even lie to you
[Chorus: PARTYNEXTDOOR & Drake]
Swear these days all you say is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she hit me with is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once, oh
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""

[Verse 3: Drake]
Why you gotta start, girl, why you gotta start?
I know we make time for the things that we want
I know you got another nigga tryna play the part
Just 'cause he got a heart don't mean he got heart
Could be standin' in a field, and he still ain't in the field
If anything should change then I thought we had a deal
Lately you keep questionin' what you get out the deal
Doin' things to make me feel the way I make you feel
How hard is it to let you know when I'm comin' home?
That way you can be prepared
Maybe take a couple sick days and not miss pay
I don't even know what things are looking like inside of your place
Or how it's decorated
This thing is gettin' one-sided, I can't even lie to you right now
Yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
All she talkin' bout is, ""Come and see me for once
Come and see me for once
You don't ever come to me, you don't ever come to me""
All she hit me with is, ""Come and see me for once

Now summertime whips come through and bust up the block

And sell the work right to hush, y'all niggas must have forgot
But I was there Nas don shit, a couple things sit on my conscience
With that said, look at all we accomplished
Yea, sure this ain't Compton but this ain't a fairytale land neither
We all lost mad people, the city wild
They gave the task to a purposeful child
Verses start to get a little more personal now
But that’s cause everybody else sound is so played out though
Oliver North in the cut Dolce'd out though
A thousand dollar bottle it get poured straight out though
I'm screaming OVO on the whole way out though
I'm back boy for real, I'm that boy for real
I got hits nigga, you just a batboy for real

But, you just walked in
Once you get to talkin', how I lost it
Hard to call it all my fault, mama

Somewhere in the trap now
Wonder why he trap now

And if you think about me, I'm 'bout to think about you

Just a young nigga with the time like me

Don't hold your breath
Don't wait on my love
Don't hold your breath
Don't wait on my love

[Verse 1]
Don't wait on my reply to your text
Don't wait on my nut from your sex
Don't trust me to capture the moment
Forgive me, it just was a moment
Don't lay up, I'd rather her stand out
I heard number two is your man now
Don't mind me bein' number two now
I'ma man up, ain't no man down
You see, I don't give no fucks now
Is it somethin' we discussed now?
The truth got you in disgust now
'Cause I'd rather we just fuck now

[Chorus]
Don't hold your breath (Don't hold it, oh)
Don't wait on my love (Don't wait on my love, oh no)
Don't hold your breath (Don't hold it, no)
Don't wait on my love (Ooh, don't wait on my love, love)
[Verse 2]
I put the dirt into dirt bag
Still got your jacket in my bag
I stood you up, that was my bad
Gave me your heart, watch me break that
Many different bitches in the coupe
This is how low that a mack stoop
Me bein' faithful's the issue
Tryna clean up 'cause you comin' soon
I broke her off in the livin' room
There is a smell in the livin' room
Know that's fucked up, that's what pimpin' do
Ooh, know that's fucked up, that's what pimpin' do, woah

Don't hold your breath (You might suffocate, yeah, yeah)
Don't wait on my love (Don't wait on my love, don't wait on my love, oh)

[Verse 3]
Wash my dick off before I get home
Maison Margiela on me, though
I'm the opposite of hero
The opposite of your hero
The make up, the breakup was see-through
The way I did you was illegal
Your girl was right, yeah, she called it
You should believe in your people
Tucked you, then went to the strip club
VIP, I got my dick sucked
Came back to you and I kissed ya
That led to fucking on the tour bus
Packed up and went back to Oakland
Finally, it's out in the open
I gave you the hope, you did the hopin'
[Chorus]
Don't hold your breath (Don't hold your breath, don't hold your breath, woo)
Don't wait on my love (Don't wait on me, I'll let you down, I'll let you down, yeah)

Always going back to some shit that I already been in

Found herself now she demanding respect more

You love to see me breakin' down

[Verse 1]
Girl, you don't say much, ah
Is it too much to ask you
To look at your reflection and ask yourself, oh
""Do you need me how I need you?""
I brought you to California, for what?
'Cause right now you're so, so sick of my guts'
You got me out here hittin' my crunches
You got me out here skippin' on lunches
I wanna be per-per-perfect for when the next time I see ya
Iced up, baby, I'm drippin', drippin' like my jeweler
Ballin', baby, need a hoop for your Hula, woah

You the, you the, you the baddest bitch [?]
Beep, beep, put you through crazy things, baby, you a trooper

Help me slip in and out that jam, woah, woah
But I don't think you see that though
I'm lying, baby girl, you stole ten grand from the safe
How I'm supposed to feel safe?
Baby girl, this rocks was for you
How you still actin' like groupie?
Why you act like you don't know me?
Before all the K's, Kylie's, and Kehlani's, whoa
Why you do me this way?
Must be how it go when you crack the Drake code, Draco

You say this too soon, I say this too soon
They say this too soon, but I want you right now, baby
I'ma get it right, I'ma get it right

I let you play the sympathy role too long
Still I see you're still holdin' on too strong to it

[Verse 1]
You wrong for this
Everybody knows that I've been honest
Move on from it, it's too obvious
Worked too hard to make me the bad guy
And I worked too hard for me to keep sacrificin', my silence
You gotta quit and break down baby girl
And just quit lyin'
Stop complainin', quit complainin'
Yeah, it's not workin', I keep puttin' my work in
And now you out here callin' me out and still
When all I do is wish you good will
And only work I do is God's will
I'm not the only one that thinks that you need to chill

Shouldn't nobody believe you're not hurtin' still (Nobody believe you)
You talkin' all that peace and happiness but you still tryna kill me
(You confused)
It's a shame, it's a shame, yeah (Shame, yeah)
Shoulda known sittin' courtside, you learned how to play games
They don't believe you nah, I'm the only one who put his head down
On your hospital bed, you the one who let me down
It starts to make sense now
You took my silence for granted, babe
I learned no compromisin', babe
You really tried it, baby, ooh, I
The truth will set you free, oh, girl
What happened to positivity?
I let them believe that you left me, nah nah (Prayers)
Yeah, it was about you all the time, ayy

Got to move on from it
Got a little growin' up to do
Got a little ownin' up to do
If you know Party, I'ma say what I'ma say
If I go tomorrow, I'ma go out one way
They gon' say that Party told the truth every time
I'm a rider, it's my job, don't cross the line
Fuck it, never compromise, they feedin' your family over these women
They gon' put your life on the line like a pigeon
You keep on dissin', you keep on trippin'
You need to dead all of those lies to keep on livin'
And all that stuff comin' out of your mouth, baby, it's so dumb
I know it's people on your side who ride for you, but I don't know them
'Cause I was the one who called the ambulance and said you was forgiven
Even though that I was the one that was cheated on
Had to watch you tell the story wrong

With all these distractions, look I'm a fool, girl
Look I can't tell
If shawty feel me, tell me if you feel me
If I was broke, still grindin' locked in Broward
Would you still feel me?
If feds called and said they caught me on some drugs
Would you leave me?
If I was runnin' through the 6 with my woes
You'd be way, way back
But there'll never be emotion
You are a grown ass bitch
You the realest (you know that) recognition
I'm just glad that you know

Cause it's never bad for my reflection
You know I need that good weed, good sex, good neck, et cetera
Hoes leave, hoes call and hoes trifling, God bless it
Bad bitches sitting and they mix sound good
Make it sound good
Snakes was in the garden and it's not our good
Cause the time's good
I ain't gotta preach to ya', nothing like a leech nigga
I ain't got a leash to ya'
OMO I'm proud of it, sitting on the cloud of it
Probably need to sell it like Clicquot
My ego is bigger than your ego, get rich off this, dirty Contradicting nigga couldn't piss this shit
My bitch 5'5"" waist 33
Only white rice, raw fish, seaweed
Sushi in the Ritz but she Swiss though
Cause you know they like their chocolate with a kiss though
Can't believe she out here calling Wi-fi, ""Wee-fee""
But her mama got an ass, she a peace treaty
Only now how to move fast, she 3G
And you'll never get a fast one, I'm too deep
Party no PG nigga

Couldn't be a nigga house
Lookin' for a real bitch
Lookin' for a real one, prolly gon' have to steal one
I'm ridin' with the go-getters
Ridin' with attention, you don't want attention
Since there's more money then you know there's more protection
Got a little bad bitch on my arm cause
You know it’s only good for a young nigga reflection
You know I need that good weed

But there won't be no I owe you's
No teasing you, gonna kiss on your lips where it's pleasing you

Come on in, lay the table
It's your body I wanna feast
Girl tonight I'll be your waiter
I'm gonna serve your midnight treat
What you like, a little teaser?
Enough to wet your appetite
A little taste of something sweeter
Served just the way you like

I wanna taste your world
I want your lips on mine
I wanna pleasure you, anywhere you want me to

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I make you say “ooh” a little more
I think you ready for the main course
A little cream and cherry thing
That I can spread below your naval ring
I work my way down just a bit lower
I wanna kiss your body right
And when you think that it's over
I'll make it last all night
[Pre-Hook]

Cut 'em off, like Korean barbecue scissors
I wear expensive Cartier frames, they ain't see the vision
I could do it all by myself, no assistance
And I could do it all by myself with no assistance

Everyone that and this, but don't take risk
If you don't use your gift, you could lose your gift
All you gotta do is work, but choose your shift
If you don't got drive like me, you better find your lift
It's a different breeze that I blow
I was chasing waterfalls
I got good at being rich
I was great at being broke
Tryna tell me, what to do
You don't know what to do
If you knew the next move
You'd be me and not you
Being damaged your nice image
Gotta refuse all empathy
Gotta refuse all sympathy
Everybody’s fine till they need me financially
I'm a legend, if I go deceased
Call me crazy, when I get to a preaching
Kuwait, Kuwait, Bugatti
Diamonds
Yuh, yuh, yuh

They ain't know me then, I bet they know me now
Dead weight ain't do nothing, but slow me down
Pure confidence, straight dominance
Need no co-defendants, no accomplices
No more guarantees, no more promises
Left wrist is Tourbillon, you know, what time it is
Waitin' to see if you arrived yet
They 'ont see the vision, they ain't get they eyes checked
Too many opinions make it hard for you
But really who better for the job than you?
Clip the noise now, I live a sound life
I just bet it on myself and double down twice

Rule number one
Don't trust a nigga, who don't got brothers, who say, bruh

Rule number three
If you got money better stick with stick with a condom
Rule number four
Don't trust with a bitch, you just met who wanna cuddle

[Verse 3: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I'ma give you a couple
I get paid in a duffle
I chose money not fame
So they payin' me double
Selling hits off my mumbles
It's so hard to be humble
It's okay to be ballin'
Nigga, just don't fumble
[?] at the crib
Step up the chips

I bring a bic to the bridges
Let's bring a bitch to the clinic
My lifestyle is so expensive
My ice all on my senses
Sorry for not being sensitive
