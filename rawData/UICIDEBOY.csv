It's not fair, I found love

They figure me a dead motherfucker
But I'm just a motherfucker that wanna be dead
Snow Leopard with the lead in his head, turnin' me into a sweater
Bitches use me as their fucking bedspread
I be the silhouette of a sunset
Smoke a cigarette while I compress my depression
Stare into the violet fluorescent lights, makes me violent
I'm tryna get the highest I can get before I overdose and die
My ribs are nothing but an empty cage, black hole in my chest
Big bang, Yung Plague on the tip of a wave
In my head, I feel like I'm a guest, so I'ma throw it all away
Because when I am dead, I will be nothing decomposin' in a grave
I'm matter, but I don't matter
I can feel my skull shatter from the dull chatter
Brain splattered on the wall
Grey stains won't dissolve, gonna have to paint it all
[Chorus: Butterfly Boucher]
It's not fair, I found love
It made me say that get back
You'll never see daylight
If I'm not strong, it just might

[Verse 2: $lick $loth]
Always boasting my emotions on how I'm so fucking broken
Think I'm joking when I'm talkin' about blowing my head open
'Til the moment you walk in and find my body motionless
Wrists slit, thoughts of $licky falling in an open pit, shit
Always burn my bridges 'cause I'd rather fall in ditches
If life's a game of inches, then my dick has been the biggest
And my goal's to fuck the world until that motherfucker's twitchin'
Lane switchin', same mission, to die and blame my addiction, bitch

Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons

Death keeps cheating on my life, but on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain, this torture of horror
That I'm always conceding

I come through with helicopters
Beaucoup blades, and hella choppers
Looking like the dawn of Vietnam
Ruby crashin' on the lawn, who the fuck else dare to stop us?
Bitch, come through, blue veins turn into new stains
One of the original seven like Liu Kang
Slit the wrist of the six, no one left but me, bitch
The 7th Ward Lord got a new name
But Ruby does not exist due to a personality split
One-half devil, other half got zipped
Now, who the fuck else wanna talk shit?
Now, who the fuck else wanna get ripped?
Now, who the fuck else think I'm a bitch?
Come take a fucking sit
I swear to no god, you'll end up in a crypt

Snappin' like necks from that Bank on the west
Kurt Cobain veins, opium in my chest
Escaped out the psych ward, now I'm on a murder spree

Drownin' in sleeping pills, covered in ashes
Ridin' down Paris, this life never mattered
Ready to die, bitch, I'm ready to die
I pull on this trigger got blood on my satin
""Fuck, is he okay?"" No, I'm just insane
Deranged out the gate, it's always been my fate

Crucified in Tommy, Yung Christ risen out the concrete

But Ruby can't afford to move towards the horde just yet

Engulfed in flames, engulfed in blood
As it rains from the red heaven that Yung Plague has escaped

Ruby setting trends, but in the end, he wants his breath to cease

Ruby got a plan involving firestorms thinnin' out the herd
Ruby got a plan to see the locusts swarm, poisoning the dirt
Ruby gonna find his death and flirt
Ruby got his motherfucking heart torn, cut up into thirds
Ruby got a broken oath, he once swore, take him back to church

First, I turned the Nile River into blood!
Then I released the frogs as the city floods!
Along with lice, flies, and I diseased your livestock!
Then I make sure the boils grow on your wife and child!
Look up at the fucking sky, you'll see a storm of hail and fire!
Then I sent out the locusts to swarm your fucking crops!
I blacked out the sun and made time stop!
Next I'm coming for your firstborn son, watch him drop!

Makin' it fucking rain alligator fangs
Lightin' the flame that ignited the revelation of Osiris
I'm risin' above the horizon, I blackened the diamond
And siphoned all of the water supply of Zion
Bitch, I cut the head clean off of the lion
Put it on a spike, and all of the sheep became enlightened, bitch
I'm standin' right beside Poseidon 'bout to release all the Titans
Footprints in the sand, followed by a herd of rotten bison

Standing in fire, I'm God of the liars
Attire is made up of nothin' but wire
The choir is singin' my praises with phrases that let you all know I'm the bastard of Satan
Black in my eyes, homicide on my mind
With that blood on my face, then I turn it to wine
Yung Christ the divine, make them fall into line
Let the planets align as they build me a shrine

Reminiscing 'bout the violence of my old days
All black, bring it back to my old ways
Closed case, kill a nigga like a young Kane, my nigga

Still popping pills, popping seals, smoking Backwoods
Still smoke a Swisher if you got it with you
Everybody wants me sober, but I'm not a quitter
I say the less you know the better, that West Bank fire-setter
$uicide dream team, it's that codeine fiend
Hellbound is what I'm deemed, surrounded by crime scenes
Only peace that I know is sleep or to be deceased, shit

Wake up wishin' that I was a fucking corpse, fuck

This ain't an option, I was opting out responsibility
Turn a new leaf and get it poppin', yuh
Pull up on they fucking ass, all they do is fuckin' ask
""Can I flash you with the gas?""
And so I pull up on they ass, then I ask
""Want to catch the gat's blast?""

Sold out shows, but I don't believe in souls
So I doubt these shows gonna leave me feelin' whole
A couple blunts, I blow, and now I'm idolized, a role model
That'll get 'em to get me to model clothes
I'd rather snort up Roxys 'till that dope bottle rattles
Nope, I'm not about to tackle yet another problem
I'll have to put this one at the bottom
I feel like fucking Sodom and Gomorrah, but life is sweet
Another black petal fallin' down right at my fucking feet
Another flower rotten, a bouquet of efforts
Sour scents are haunting my defeat
(Sold out funeral, no live nation fee)
Captivate a hunnid-thousand people, still me and the reaper meet
A hunnid-thousand want to meet you, I hope they'll let me be

Used to dream of fans chanting, screaming that ""$uicide""
Now I get on Instagram, and they posting my personal life
I promise it's not what it seems, climb up just to fall down a stream
Drag me to the river
The richer I get, the worse my liver gets

Still in my room, keep it dark as I can
Remember scrapin' up change just for cigarettes
Immortalized $uicide, no, they won't forget

They changed so much, you know what I'm saying?
How did these two motherfuckers, from New Orleans
How did they change, how did they change music?

[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Yeah, I was the wave, but now I feel the tide pullin' back
Ocean flat, often I lay in this coffin, sleep on my back, toss a couple of 'em back
My liver really startin' to slack, and I can feel myself decayin' from the cigarette packs
I haven't thought of $UICIDE since I was livin' in the back of Blackout's pad, my heart torn in half
Now I've got everything I ever wanted, but now I don't want it
It feels like I'm haunted, it feels like I'm cursed, hopefully soon I'll return to the dirt
A material world with a virtual nerve, yeah, I'll see what it's worth, throw me out on the curb
Leave me behind, walk a straight line to hell, as y'all swerve away, lost in the choice not to sell
Roll me up a blunt, ayy, I need to get lost, ayy
All y'all talkin' 'bout sauce, I'm wipin' frozen cuts with frost
I'm slicin' open guts, and tossin' frauds off to the side, half of $uicide
A couple million, now we're ready to fucking die

[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
Two cups and a bad bitch, then I pop me a Xanax, quick
Call Shake when I need that fix, call Nick when I need that itch
Call Krez just to pop on 'phetamine, Max Beck in the back; pop seventeen
Yung Kurt Cobain with the heroin, $lick love drugs over everything
Shoot the stars up in my veins, woah, but look at your bankroll
So? Just spend it on more dope, more woes, fuck you care for?
But lately, I feel guilty, I feel so badly
They say I made it, and that should be satisfactory
Lately, I feel like I have nobody
All alone in an empty hotel lobby
[Refrain: $LICK $LOTH]
4 AM, praying; can I get some rest?
Dreams of $uicide and the need for death
4 AM, praying; can I get some rest?

No halo hovering, follow me in yo' grave
Ain't got no Patek because I'll be here 'till the end of fucking times

Making mountains crumble, glaciers meltin', oceans swellin'

Looking for my medicine, pluckin' the bud off of a nug

Should have put a cap on those ashes, lackin' in fashion

At last, the moment has passed; I got a gash in my thick skull
Throw me in the trash, call for a pickup

Roll up in the tank, fuck the fame

Such a fucking bum, hauntin' sluts guts
I'm disgusted, I'm busted up
What the fuck did I just put up my nose?
I'm buggin' out, knees buckle
I'm duckin' out, I'm in trouble
Now I can see the clouds, lights out
Now I lay myself to sleep, now that I can rest in peace
No questioning my misery, my deathwish granted blissful sleep
My body turns to worms for the birds to eat
Internal decay for eternity

I can't lie, lately, I been on the fucking edge
Pistol gripped up on my lap
Xanax, heron, bunch of meds
Fantasizin' about death, just need one in my temple
Put the gun up to my head
Fuck this shit, I shot the lead and now I'm dead
Descendin' through hell, nothing but burnin' flesh smells
I scream, and scream, and scream
And hear the others yell as well
Oh well, just my luck
Devil opens up to devour me, that was my old life
Antichrist, he has empowered me

Show 'em what he's worth when he's six feet in the earth

All hail the one with the long tail
Seven-headed dragon breathing fire, make you all bail
All hail to the Frozen Shogun, slice a frozen ocean open
Throw him in and then claim it was all a tall tale (Ayy!)
No treasure in my chest
All that is left is a half-blackened heart that's decaying
It barely pumps, blood stuck in clumps
What I'm paying for pills, all this pain should be numb or delaying

Don't need a napkin, put me in the casket
Ruby dead and bloody, matching with the fucking maggots

Father, forgive them for thinking they testing me
Father, forgive them whenever they rest in peace
Smoke in my lungs, swallowed pills in my throat
My antidote for that murder he wrote
Stuck on this road, I just want to go home
Stuck on this dope, and I can't leave it alone

Cynical *59, death we crave
Sharpening the blade so the wrist can be shaved
Enslaved to the minds of the fucking new wave
Creep in the alley, the valley of death
Deep in the city of choppers and TECs
I'm deaf to the screams of the innocent; fuck all the citizens

Pacing myself before she takes me away
Blood stains painted on the door frame
Floor made of bones, I'm collecting and I'm storing
All of my sins are burned in my mind
Memory fading, but I still remember the scythe
Body separated from my soul
How it goes when you're always alone
No bitch, no hoe, solo, no phone, no home
Just a grave that I dug with a blanket of bugs
Bitch, I'm naked full of drugs
Fully faded, pull the plug, bitch, I made it with a shrug
I'm aware that I don't give a fuck, hoe36Embed"

Make it splash, and all of a sudden, I'm getting ashes

Got the wheels spinnin', but my blood's thinning
Oddy telling me that it's time to quit it—but I can't, I'll faint
Just one little taste real quick, so I get straight
I'm so in debt with this shit, I can't pay
I'm so in love with this shit, I can't think, mind gone blank

Seek this money, wrist keep bleeding (Ooh—)

Petals on the floor freezing
A world once unexplored, I think I'm Marco Polo covered in thorns
Set my compass to avoid tethered forms
New Orleans is war-torn, I ain't bettin' scores
And all of my friends are now whores
And I'm bored of the replication of the life

Fuck you, bitch, I'm here all by myself
I tried the belt, but couldn't get it tight enough
So I smoke the blunt, my lungs are rust
My brain is dust from all of these drugs
I can't think straight, I'll walk the plank
Spill my blood so sharks will come and eat me (come and eat me...)
—Whole!
In between Hell and Earth, I do the limbo
My body alive, but my mind is dead
Going through the motions, all of them emotions
Dump me in the ocean, I'm drowning again
We don't have to pretend

[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
Okay, here we go, blade to my throat
Whole floor soaked with blood from a goat
Bag full of dope, room full of smoke
All black coat with a wolf for a cloak
Do you feel my essence? Depressing presence
My main goal in death is to blow up heaven
Don't get the message, can't teach the lesson
Just a feeling that you get when you hang with peasants
Ridin' down Crescent, my weapon is oh-so-sharp and ready
Ward of the 7th, the legend is that you won't see twenty
Me and Lil Uzi full of cruelty, just a product of the times

Got a bunch of bags up in the attic hidin' all my bad habits
$lick? He got some bad habits, plus he's asthmatic
All the smoke that I be dragging, bitch
I need some casket for my fucking lungs, they fucking damaged
Like the Black Flag, classic Sabbath? Never heard of that shit
Bitch, I work, it ain't for assets
Roll a solo blunt, no matching
It's because of all the gadgets why I keep a social status
Fucking phones and tablets...
Bitch, I do this shit just for Jefe
Yeah, he told me make it happen
Then he died in that tragic car crash
And every time I think of that I'm flickin' ashes
Yeah, it sucks when you realize life is fast
And I'm a fucking cashless organism tryna thrive inside a habitat that's plastic

[Verse 2: $LICK $LOTH]
It's that motherfucker that ya momma said don't hang with
Meet me in the gallows, bitch, I promise that it's painless
Stupid motherfuckers thinking that we on the same shit
Cock it back, and then I yell, ""Okay, here comes the pain, bitch!""
Up in gangster's paradise, could give a fuck about your life
Every time I roll the dice, sixes popping up twice
Bitches tryna sacrifice their pussy, but I am not enticed
Good try, hoe
I do this shit for Dirt, so I ain't got the time, hoe

Because they're percieved as too strong or addictive

Actually become addicted

I got a romance with the dead that's sleeping in river beds, uh
Damaging my organs, to me, they just ain't important
I'm a different kind of breed, the one that don't even breathe
The one you ain't gotta feed, just rob and take what I need

Mistaken for something nice

Got a roll of duct tape, and a rag soaked in chloroform
Flies swarm because my body's warm, shatter the urn

Saw that when I was fourteen, walking around the 2nd Ward
Send him to the seventh floor
Ended up with floor seats to something I didn't want to see
Now that scene is in my head every time I go to sleep
When I dream, I rest in peace knowing I'll be dead

Poison me with lead, inject it into my fucking head

Pressure, pressure
How do I dear deal with all this pressure?
In my way
It’s in my lungs
It’s in my thoughts
It’s in my brain
A guilty conscience some might say, I’m paranoid and locked away
A withering weed in the garden that God wasn't supposed to save
Locked up in an open grave
With a King James' Bible
With a couple quotes erased, but kept the ones that made me smile
Do I really see everything for what it is?
Or is it that I can’t see anything with such a bad case of denial
When I die, then put my body in a boat
And light it on fire, push me out to sea
And let the wind do what I might-a
No matter whatever I feel about anything
It wasn’t until I burned all my bridges
It made my future brighter55Embed"

Still got the cash, bitch, I burn it for fun (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Put the Glock to my skull then I—

[Verse 2: Wetto]
Represent that East 59, it's a Grey thing
Creepin’ round your motherfucking block with no plates, mane
Make your motherfucking front yard to a gun range
Blocka, blocka with the choppa, turn your name to a stain
Big dog, no heart, we ain't built the same, nah
Big gars, Xan' bars fucking up my brain, yeah
Fentanyl, lotta barre, flowing through my veins, ayy
Adderall, speedballs, I might go insane, fuck
Yeah, whole lotta drugs, life close to done
Demons climbin' on my walls in my bedroom
I got tendencies of suicidal ideation
Menace to society when I ain't medicated

[Outro: Yung Plague]
Still got the badge, still got the gun
Still got the patch, still got the stun
Still got the cash, bitch, I burn it for fun

Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick, then I pull out the ski
Put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That’s what a nigga get being P.I.E
Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick, then I pull out the ski
Put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That’s what a nigga get being P.I.E
Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick, then I pull out the ski
Put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That’s what a nigga get being P.I.E

[Verse 1: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Bitch, I came here to destroy, everything I touch turn grey
I'm lacking coin, slit my wrist so I get paid
Fuck them other boys, I'll slap them in they fucking face
Knot the noose, they think they grey
Endless bites like a buffet
Grey*59 great white, I'll chew on your bitch
And then end your shit all in the same night
Don't fuck with them fake types
I be just like Moses, I make my own way, like I'm partin' the ocean
I'm part of the ocean
I be like a tidal wave crashin' on shore in slow motion
These hoes get wet when I pull out the net
Leave 'em on deck just to dry
Then I gut 'em whenever I feel fucking hopeless

Slide for the free, kill for the fee
Pull out the stick, then I pull out the ski
Put a motherfucker face on a white tee

Put a motherfucker face on a white tee
That’s what a nigga get being P.I.E

[Verse 2: $WITCHBLADE $CRIM]
Put a motherfucker's face on a white tee
Riding in the Honda while I creep with the G
Lil Uzi with the AR-teen
Hit 'em, then we dump the bodies in a six-foot stream
Red dot beam, woeful king
Fiends on my line every time the phone ring
Since eighteen, sipping codeine
Promethazine covered all on my spleen
Aquamarine trapping out of the water
My alma mater is the school of the slaughter
Every since I first heard, ""Wanna Be a Baller""
Dreams of whippin' dubs on the Chevy Impala
The fucking shot caller
No commas or dollars
Just stank marijuana I got from Nevada
I'm hitting nirvana and fucking Madonna
Mirage of a brain that's encompassed by trauma19Embed"

[Verse 1: Ruby da Cherry]
Burnin' all my cash, sip and dash
Gotta find a way to close the fuckin' gash in the back of my fuckin' head
What I'm thinking keeps leaking out
I don't want them to know what I'm thinkin' now
Now they asking why I'm singin' now (Mmm)
Bitch, I'm bored of fucking raps, and I'm bringing out my guns
I'd dap you up, but my hands busy holdin' the gun to my skull
Bitch, I told 10 Deep to keep your free clothes
Then me, $lick, and Smurf peaced out to go blow some clean dro'
Worship the Devil so people don't fuck with me, but it's okay, 'cause I don't fuck with people
They don't understand our fucking lingo
Keep on diggin' myself into a deep hole

[Verse 2: $uicide Christ]
Everybody got a full clip
Always be fucking the same, bitch, don't tell me how you're different
Shut the fuck up, boy, and listen
Couple hundred in my Swisher, bitch, I'm smoking on whatever
Don't let that bullshit affect us, 'cause we ain't never gon' let up
Make one call and you handled, I know some men with no future
Just some scumbag motherfuckers that'll cut up ya' shooter
Stoned and dead like Medusa, trench coat hidin' my Ruger
I got them blades like I'm Krueger, then I come back like Looper

Back from the dead like I'm Jesus (Ayy)
Skip to the next track if you think that we are facetious (let's get it)
Ruby da Cherry ripe for the season
$uicideBoy$, yeah, we still breathin' (Ahh!)

[Verse 1: LIL OOZING]
I'm the black sheep of this music industry shit (Yah)
Used to be a flock of us, but now the flocks depletin'
7th Ward Charizard, I melt the ice you claim is freezin'
'Cause I was born in April, I'm the shiny diamond heathen
Y'all fuckboys who claimed they push keys, all deleted
Them fuckboys who claimed they got swag
All competing for the same Gucci sweater
That I been had the receipt, bitch
I'm the fucking wave
Y'all just stuck in a bed, in a room, on a cruise
Throwin' up 'cause you seasick
While your bitch is cheating on you, I'm the one who beatin'
I'm just sayin', y'all think that I'm playin', but I ain't got a reason to
98' Benz coupe looking like Pikachu
99' Benz coupe looking like Beetlejuice
Whatever
Who gives a fuck? I still feel like a teen recluse
'Bout to give these needles use
Numb me up, uh
Numb me up, yah
Numb me up, ayy
Numb me up, yah
Numb me up, ayy
Numb me up, yah

[Verse 2: LIL CUT THROAT]
Hear no evil (evil)
See no evil (evil)
Speak no evil (right)
Find myself speaking to ghosts a bit more often now
Devils die too, Lucifer bound for the ground (Pussy)
Get some money, watch how many hands come reachin' out
(Shut up—what?)
Lit up my cigarette, another accident
Fuck anybody that thinks I'm a saint
Fuck anybody that want me to change (What?)
No one changes ever, that's why my Glock's on the dresser
And if I'm keepin' it real, I'm never-ever lacking (Try me)
Motherfuckers know $lick ain't never-ever slackin' (Try me)
Whether the shotgun, or the 9 millimeter
They be knowin' $crimmy keeping the heater
Nonetheless, got my people up my ass
Worried I'mma blow my brains on the glass ($ui–)
I smoke a cigarette and laugh, kettles calling pots black (Ha-ha-ha!)
But sometimes I get violent, silent (Shh)
The fuck I'm supposed to do when Cut Throat always the problem?
That's why Cut Throat cuts throats with the sharp blade, though
Got my Faygo on Easter
Signed Germ, said, ""ball like the Lakers""
DN$ 3, pipe up, what it be
They know they scared of it
$uicide dead boys, keep a tribe with me
G*59, don't give a fuck, boy
I don't give a fuck, boy (What?)
Don't give a fuck, boy (Yeah)
Hear no evil
See no evil
Speak no evil (Right)
Hear no evil
See no evil
Speak no evil (Yeah)
Hear no evil
Speak no evil
See no evil, bitch

""We're gathered here today to remember the lives of Ruby and $crim, also known to many as the $uicideBoy$. What they gave to this world while they were here, was unexplainable. You know, we're all here, maybe— Well, today we can share some memories, walk around, my name is Ricky Kekney. Hey, I'm Ricky, if you don't know me you can come up to me, don't feel uncomfortable. I, I know... I know I give off a stand-offish vibe, I don't feel uncomfortable. We'll talk, come up to me, we'll talk about the boys, we'll celebrate today. Today is about celebrating the lives of two legends. Before we start sharing stories, I would like everybody to bow their head for ten seconds, in remembrance.""18Embed"
