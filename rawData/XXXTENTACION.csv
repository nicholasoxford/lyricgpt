Let's murder different races, grow hatred, and form irrelevant
Views,” and etcetera, knives thrown

No pressure, no gimmick shit, no radio records
Just textbook rhyme style with the raw texture
Punchlines, right hooks, now that's a trifecta
No more free lectures, I'm taxin' these niggas extra

I'm the only one stressed
And the only one tired of having fake friends
Put the noose on my neck
And the hole in my back, again
I've been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end
Waste of tears
Waste of years and months

If death is what it seems
Why is it so vividly portrayed within my dreams?
The fear of understanding the Devil's running his course
Hatred's not received, it's coming straight from the source
Remorse, as this time becomes a factor
Mind's full of greed, exposing your benefactors
Backwards, pace backwards, everyone is superficial
Only breaching the surface, surface upon the Earth
And flames engulf the Earth, and prized possessions, they incinerate
This is far beyond any director tried to demonstrate
See the record, here's the record, take the record, set it straight
Perplexed, only receive slumber when at Heaven's gates
And this is fairly simple for your breath, try and contemplate
Your conversates, hesitate and navigate your inner traits
Back to a time where minds were just matter
If you stated opinions, then bones would begin to shatter
It didn't matter back then 'cause there was no reacting, acting up
Chevy in black, Acuras
Accurate facts put the black, in fact, if you thought that
You are free, you should disregard that, all facts

Feelin' like a pawn to the greed of these fools

In the womb of these fake fuck niggas
With they masks up, presume
I'll be telling, if I got a load, I swear I resume
On my conquest
For the key to the chest where my mind slept
And the love in my heart is a cancer
And I spread it through the wall as an answer
To the cries of the dead and the vanquished
The depressed and the lost and the damned, it's
Preservation of the peace, an ideal world
Never lonely when you flowin' through my mind, girl
I apologize, 'cause I couldn't see the pain in your damn eyes
'Cause a nigga made you leave with your heart in between different pains
Couldn't see ya when ya ain't cry

Why the fuck should I apologize? Country's orderless, it's a lie
By these fuckin' government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future, it's right in my hands
And the future of many youth, if I play my cards can advance, and-
Genuine dime, I opened my mind, and where can I find this future?
Sever your mind or you will be blind, and trapped in a mind of lies within our walls
I'm feelin' like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides) The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, dependin' on people resemblin' Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it's PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?

This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America.  What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives.

And your spouse only know what you don't erase
The world only know you by your worst mistakes
So spaz on they ass, that's the only way
Smash on the gas down Stony, ayy

And when I'm on my way, X hold the gate
Terrorize shit, we don't negotiate
If you bitch-made, we don't associate
Show up at your birthday if you owe me cake
With a black mask, that's how we exfoliate
So pardon my way, my heart's in the way
I follow my thoughts, ain't no logic in Ye
Said that's all I'ma say, if he caught him a case
Then send him to jail, like a dog in a cage
I ain't feeling the age, no rottin' away
You're dark as the days, you caught in the way
'Cause coffins is laid under a tombstone
'Cause even when you die, they still throwin' rocks at your graves
So follow the wave, can't swallow the hate
My mind trumps anything that a scholar could say
Don't know how to behave, we rage out of the raves
Dislocate an arm, just pop it in place
'Cause the damned, they ain't it, all the pain and anguish
Turned me into a man, so I ain't complainin'

[Verse: XXXTENTACION & Killstation]
I see black skies, and white lies, I'd rather be
Dead, filling my head with different enemies
Thoughts consuming me, fueling my insecurities
As the ground right under me crumbles as if it wasn't there
It's too much, my heart's crushed, I'm not alive
I won't allow myself happiness 'cause it's all lies
I've seen the pain, I've run away so many times
Death and I are companions, it's here at all times
I won't love, won't trust, I won't die
I can't feel, but managed to steal your heart, love
Was dirt poor, now fuck whores and want love
It seems that anything offered could be enough, but
As time, body falls, so I don't know who to call
Alone and my heart, got tat' of it broke
I'm so fucking numb, my life has succumbed
To hatred and death alone in the snow

To what I'm looking for, in general
I can't keep living like this
It's breaking my heart, day by day
I mean, who's to say...
Who's to say you find an answer when living?
What if you just die?
What if life as we know it is all a game?
What if we live for no reason?
What if you just disappear when you die?
Should I cling to life
Or should I just kill myself?
So many contradictions, contemplations
It's getting harder and harder to mask my pain
I can't tell if I wanna live or if I wanna die
Please, save me40Embed"

When you woke up (And all I ask of you is hear)
My feet weren't covered (The girl with the golden heart)
When you started getting dressed (I'm killed from the inside out at dawn)
The sun started falling (The sun's only just arose)
When you woke up (Can't amount to all the hearts I've broke)
My feet weren't covered (The boy with the broken heart)
When you started getting dressed (His goal is to rip everything apart)

Left her tied back home

Rather than smoking, the nigga simply going insane
Tying himself to a bridge as it began to occur
Fucker couldn't breathe, his sight had even went to a blur

I've held a ghost
And I, could've been
Next fall, next blade in the king
Bleed red, four doors in the Benz
But I met four ghosts in the pen
And it slipped through my fingertips
And I, could've been
I've lost all hope
Dead, boy, my soul is amiss
Flushed skin, X types of a kiss
Rather hate, bitch
I want nothing to do with this
Just face the abyss, and I (Ayy!)
Place blame for this shit (Ayy)
Rather be dead, dull blades on my wrist, wrist
Fucking with my head, get dead, that's the gist
Flushed, you can see it on me, I'm pissed, pissed
Lost in the mist (Ayy), pants full of piss (Ayy)
Pick a daffodilly, so pretty at this
Fist fuck, started feeling, silly willy, take a look
At the rope, then he jumped
All he needed was a brick, brick

Daisy, those are making Fugazi
If we don't leave
Lost, I pick up a case and
Close it, close it, pick up the rabies (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

You came all this way for a door, watching others break it down
Now I see what you came for, lover
All or nothing aren't the same score

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION & Noah Cyrus]
(I thought you got all you came for)
Thought I lost my mind
With the pastor preachin', or the picture paintin'
With a heart embracin'
Ever since, from the Southside
Sorted out in a archive, for the black price, suitcase and a black tie
How profound, I find it funny
No explainin' how I lost my self
But I'm chillin' in the bookshelf
With a pocket knife, slit your wrist with your act to right
Such is life
Ecstacy, slit wrist, and a vagabond
Vagabond, vagabond, you're my ecstasy

[Bridge: XXXTENTACION, Noah Cyrus, Both]

Are you tasting me?
But I miss you and I hate you

Shut it down, going to take you outside (Woah, woah, woah)
Sucking up the dust from your static crown (Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God)
Oh, just to turn away, and you'll be golden (Hello, hello)
Over, over (Woah, What? What?)

But do you want more?

Push drugs in my pocket
I'ma pull it out and then pop it

What kind of sorcery is this?

[Verse: XXXTENTACION]
You ever seen a nigga hung with a gold chain?
I'd rather sing about the same things that we claim
Such is bashful, but niggas like the task force
Mobbin' on the streets and robbin' stores in ski masks, bruh
Niggas ask for peace in a riot and bring violence
'Cause it's a game of cat and mouse and you gon' bleed silent
What's the justice in sayin' fuck it and grab the pump?
Then kill a woman of many children makes you a chump
Look at all the stores you wreckin', nigga I reckon
Think about the people who own it for about a second
I know you got your problems, but brother, they got theirs
This is not a game, quit violence and grow a pair
But yo, you'd rather hear me say, ""Fuck black prejudice!""
""Let's murder different races, grow hatred and form irrelevant!""
Views and etcetera, knives thrown
Damage 'em, lives blown, oblivion hole cold, oblivious
I won't dare say that you should stop the fuckin' ignorance
Murder ops, killin' shit, I'd enjoy the thrill of it
Bath in blood of officers', different corpses, offin' 'em, Auction 'em, don't you bark at 'em
Murder 'em, never heard of 'em
I could preach the peace but say ""fuck it"" and preach the murder
'Cause this ain't fuckin' life that we livin'
Go ahead and grab the extension
Grab another one: uncle, cousin, brother, son
Glory to all the chosen ones that will rid you of the innocence
But in a sense, innocent will soon behold the ignorance
Blasphemous, killin' our own, murderin' black—
[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Equity and equality: the end result we all — the ones that don't want to live in misery, that is — desire.  And naturally we all black and white are schadenfreude or malicious. Here are a few examples

Emmett Till, August 28th, 1955, Mississippi — pulled out of his house in the middle of the night, in front of his mother who had to watch her son be taken from her on the sidelines, for little to no reason at all worth murdering a fourteen-year-old boy.  Castrated, mutilated, but also documented for the years to see
Kori Ali Muhammad, black-on-white. Philando Castile, white-on-black.  Now these things never come to or remotely remain in the public eye. And the youth is never inspired to take a stand to make a difference. So I will speak for them. The youth, that is, the ones full of innocence. The ones inspired by the things around them, to matter

I can go on forever about the fact that murder is murder whether you're black or white. You should always feel free to voice your opinion, but to act out on these irrational thoughts in every shape or form is disgusting. You cannot, as black or white, call yourself the supreme race when moved out of your comfort by the opposition's color, their skin color.  That is no form of being or demonstrating being a supreme being

If you are a supremacist, be unmoved by the opposition. Remain unscathed in the comfort of your own home, in your own realm. Demonstrate care for the youth's future, white or black, black or white. Are you willing to risk your child's future due to your own bigotry? The choice is yours, but your child will not stand for the hate. This generation will be loved, nurtured, heard and understood13Embed"

To find, to find the exact words, to find the perfect words, to say less, but to say more, was ideal with this project, and to let my energy and mind be felt, in a less aggressive way, but a more passive and genius way was ideal with this album, to show the versatility and to show the open- to open minds in itself was the goal of this album, and to acquire a large amount of passion, and love and appreciation for myself was the goal of this album; loyalty to myself was the goal of this album. So, I'll offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you don't listen to the alternative sound and you've never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last.

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Two shots for me and fuckin' Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking bucklin' up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fuckin' him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written and such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fuckin' nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking ***, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And shower solutions to the black and the white
And endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cult scripture, we're all used to be causin' a ruck
Drownin' women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of himself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Slow dancin' with the devil in a burnin' room
Two-steppin' ahead until they lock me in a tomb
Been doomed since they pulled us out the womb
Satan preyin' on me, she been throwin' souls inside the wombs
Life shouldn't eat you up, spit you out, beat you up
But, bitch, the third eye stay open, don't think I blink enough
Maybe I see too much, baby, I can't call it
I leave my soul in these bars like a alcoholic
I can't trust nobody
I'll put that on my mind, soul, and my whole body
I see demons, and there's nothin' they don't know about me
No matter how much I try to hide, they gon' find me
So now I never run from it 'cause I come from it
I never lied, I resides in the beast's stomach
I looked the Devil in the eyes, I could see she bluffin'
I pull the red dress to the side, tell her keep cummin', keep cummin'
[Verse 3: Kemba]
I just found out family and enemies could be different
I was steppin' over syringes that's in my kitchen
After mama died, I couldn't go to the bathroom
Without gettin' some second-hand heroin high while pissin'
This is just me paintin' a picture of what I live with
What you know about comin' home to your shit missin'
And findin' out the niggas that helped you look for it had did it?
This is just me paintin' addiction
These niggas took methamphetamine, ketamine, edibles, and a bean
Niggas stole my denim jeans, Den of Thieves DVD, literally anything
Food I bought from the vending machine
Credit card crack any door like janitor keys
Niggas even took credit for the man I would be (Ah)
And if I let him, he would probably take twenty percent, manager fee
I'm so scared of my genes, I considered celibacy
Afraid I would ruin my seeds, like Adam and Eve
I got blood on the fuckin' leaves of my family tree
Just give me one damn minute, this shit is hard for me
I lost my whole damn mama, I lost a part of me
She lost her whole damn life from symptoms of poverty
Grew up with Crown Fried Chicken cloggin' my arteries
Increase in robberies, police and bullets that I bob and weave
It was nonstop for me, no one is stoppin' me
Either fulfill myself or be a self-fulfillin' prophecy
This just how I introduce myself properly

God
Who the fuck is
Who the fuck is
Ayy
Cocaine
Ayy

[Verse 1: XXXTENTACION]
Two shots for me and fucking Jesus himself
Who the fuck signed the petition giving Jesus the belt?
Tie it around his neck and get to fucking buckling up
For every moment I counted on him, I'm fucking him up
Torture victims are due to scriptures, it's written as such
So every moment my uncle suffered was planned in the cut
Cut his tongue out and hammered fucking nails in his skull
Couldn't see what Jesus planned, my vision is dull, and so
If there's a fucking God, I wanna slit his fucking throat
And feed his organs to the children
And, shower solutions to the black and the white
And, endless indulgence to the youth in the night
Cold scripture all use to be causing a rut
Drowning women and many children and pillaging trust
Just the minimum, murdered many in sake of themself
He just replaced you, you are just a book on his shelf, and so
[Bridge: XXXTENTACION & Sully the Chief God]
Who the fuck is God?
Who the fuck is God?
I said, who the fuck is God?
Is he a trap star or rockstar
Or the president
Doesn't leave many men, innocent (Yah)
Yeah, see, living for a reason I don't know
Fuck Jehova
It's Sully the Chief God
Hold up, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Sully the Chief God]
Society is a parasite that darkens the soul
Keeping us ignorant and under control
Our heart's growing colder as our ego takes over
Drugs numb the pain that I carry on my shoulder
Smoking all this weed hoping that God forgives me
While I stand and refuse to bow down on my knees
Bow down on my knees
Fuck that, smoke that DMT

[Verse 3: Absentwill]
You never seen the shit I seen
Pullin' up in beams smoke by the steam
Once had hood dreams all about the cream
Then you with the team, servin' up the fiends
Poppy and a spleen, don't fuck with it
Now let me take you back to the story, that I once told
Ayy, ayy, that I once told20Embed"
