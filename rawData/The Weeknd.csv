[Verse 1]
Your man on the road, he doin' promo
You said, ""Keep our business on the low-low""
I'm just tryna get you out the friend zone
'Cause you look even better than the photos
I can't find your house, send me the info
Drivin' through the gated residential
Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[Verse 2]
I'ma let you know and keep it simple
Tryna keep it up don't seem so simple
I just fucked two bitches 'fore I saw you
And you gon' have to do it at my tempo
Always tryna send me off to rehab
Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf
I'm just tryna live life for the moment
And all these motherfuckers want a relapse

[Chorus]
I only call you when it's half-past five
The only time that I'll be by your side

Only you to trust, only you

The only time that I'll be by your side

Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO, then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go lo mein (Oh-oh-oh)

Said I'm just tryna swim in somethin' wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixin' up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sippin' on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singin' while I'm burnin' up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, makin' sure I'm gettin' home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk 'round with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight, eatin' all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you

Laisse tomber les filles
Laisse tomber les filles
Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera
Laisse tomber les filles

Non, je ne pleurerai pas

[Verse 1]
I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be

[Chorus]
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
If we just went on (Laisse tomber les filles, laisse tomber les filles)
If we just went on (Un jour c'est toi qu'on laissera)
[Verse 2]
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go

[Chorus]
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me

I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

[Verse 1]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 2]
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (Zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

[Verse 3]
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work

I'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous (oh!)
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private (oh!)
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet

And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it

Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like

Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She made her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call till the fall, he can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin'
I've been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place

[Verse 3]
I just passed that ""nigga fell off"" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow

Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth

She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top

But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic

I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
""I heard he do drugs now""
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
""Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?""
""She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony""
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

I want you to hold me while I'm smilin'

Driving down the boulevard is blindin'
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when

Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?

When you could have simply kept it on the down low

I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club

You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?

I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving

[Chorus]
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending

Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower

Said you want a little company
And I love it, 'cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still, if he knew I was here, he'd wanna kill me
(Kill me)
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be
Your pill refill and I'll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung (Pew!)
Like an ejector seat from an F-15
But tonight, we don't need those pills
Just the effects of each other, but we gon' film
'Cause I will want your ex to see (Get it?)
That...

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
[Verse 2: Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I'll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don't you know (Don't you know)
Remember when I told you (Told you)
I would never let down my guard?
And I hope you (Hope you)
Feel like dirt when I hold you (Hold you)
'Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you'll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You're nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him
Just means I will be the next to be your ex
So no complexities, just sex
And don't lecture me, just accept that...

Tell me what you're feeling
You say you don't need to go
Don't you pretend you didn't know
How all of this would end up?
Girl, I saw it in your eyes
And, baby, I can read your mind
And expectations were not in sight
You knew that talking dirty to me on the phone
Would get me here
'Cause we both wanted to do this
But I could tell that you were scared
'Cause you thought there was more to us
But you knew how this would end
It's gonna end how you expected
Girl, you're such a masochist
And I ask why
And you reply
I like the thrill
Nothing's gonna make me feel this real
So, baby, don't go home
I don't wanna spend tonight alone
Baby, please
Would you end your night with me?
Don't you leave me all behind
Don't you leave my little life

When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye

[Verse 1]
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed

[Chorus]
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
[Verse 2]
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up ‘til tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure

[Bridge]
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered

[Chorus]
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway

To fall is unacceptable

Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
'Cause your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how'd you drain all the soul from your eyes?
How'd you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no?
Every touch that you sell is a lie
[Chorus]
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...

The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun

I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside (That you're dead inside)

When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could

And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you

Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to

In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby

Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all

Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday

So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask ""Who's next? Who's next?""

I got a confession to make
I don't rush a date
Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
It's like a kiss was laced
I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays
Like a broken tape
What you do, what you do, what you do

Gon' make a nigga buy a ring for your finger
Jimmys for your feet
Jeans for that back
Lingerie for the sheets

And I'mma give it to you, to you

I'mma give it all, all, all, all, all, all, all

Super star undercover
You're my number one fan
Give it to me right
Watch the diamond glow your hand
Get you wetter than reverb, right after the dessert
Baby you're my Dairy Queen
Watch you make my baby cream

Spend my cash on my baby like
Baby, just make sure that you'll always put your man on

Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebratin' Super Bowl
Catalog lookin' legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin' on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin' thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again

'Cause it's never what it seems

Than never love at all
So here we go again

Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion tellin' us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin' lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
