I'm on that good kush and alcohol (Mike WiLL Made-It)
I got some down bitches I can call (What's hatnin'?)
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'ma ball 'til the day I fall (I'ma ball, ball, ball)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, pussy-ass nigga, stop hatin'
Lil Tunechi got that fire
And these hoes love me like Satan, man
Yeah, fuck with me and get bodied
And all she eat is dick
She's on a strict diet, that's my baby
With no makeup, she a ten
And she the best with that head
Even better than Karrine
She don't want money
She want the time that we could spend
She said, ""'Cause I really need somebody
So tell me you're that somebody""
Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't
Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon
She said, ""I never want to make you mad
I just want to make you proud""
I said, ""Baby, just make me cum
Then don't make a sound""

Uh, real nigga, fuck these haters

Pussy, money, weed, codeine
She said my dick feel like morphine
I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
She wake up, eat this dick
Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96
I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch
Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch
Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches
But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses
And I would say these hoes' names
But then I would be snitchin'
And these haters try to knock me
But they can't knock me off the hinges

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, and when they leave they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch and really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit, and when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love it

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I be with bitches that be with bitches that be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you,"" I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him""
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy, he hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs, it's a stick-up, she scream like a victim
Now you feelin' so silly, I smoke color purple, I'm up in here feelin' like Celie (Ooh)
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say? Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli (Ooh)
You can get snaked, you can get faked out by the bitch that you feelin'
'Cause you thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you tellin' your business, she tell me your business, you tell that bitch what you feelin'
All of the beans you be spillin', to you, she lie through her teeth cavities, fillin's
She know where you hide it tell me where it's hidden, she know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics, and meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains, we find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checkin', then your first thought is to start second guessin'
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothin', keep restin',"" she say, ""What's missin'?"" ""How you know somethin' missin'?""
He scratch his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,"" and she gave him some head
Boy, you can't trust them bitches, and then she say, ""Ooh""
[Refrain: Lil Wayne]
I see niggas in this bitch stuntin', poppin' bottles
Gettin' drunk with these bitches, then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches that's with the niggas we followin'
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind and tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell, she bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"" and if he say yeah, then we meet him there
She feed him lies with his silverware, she don't want love, she just want her share

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know a bitch named Liz, this nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears, and then she tell me and I be all ears
And then I go and tell my people, and they already know him, and then I call Liz, and she say he comin' over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you,"" she gave me the salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier""
We're waitin' outside, watch him pull up, walk up to the door and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked, they started French kissin' so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch, music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out of him, piss a nigga off, put a gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around, I ain't here to fuck around, caught you wit' your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin' hands up, Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
And then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her, she a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after, if Liz call you daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga, but think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga, I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drank on me, nigga, she slip somethin' in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture, Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga, you fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everythin' that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion, we have your attention
And now you're lookin' down a barrel though, nigga, now she lookin' for her pantyhose, nigga
We just lookin' for the casserole, nigga, but she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga (Mona)
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Lil Wayne]
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup and a promise he gone take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin' with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter, four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin' at 'em both poppin' up and take a picture, uh, probably on a Internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admittin' that he love her on his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa) Pussy good enough, it got him sinnin' in the walls
And he diggin' in it like he livin' in it, make a new religion with it, man a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree, sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi? Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the mornin' to The Great Gatsby, then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pit laughin', I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy, Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy, bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me 'bout a motherfuckin' double standard, actin'
Fuckin' on another nigga, that's a negative alone, but you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter of fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No) You fuckin' with Wayne's? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick) (… lick me like a lollipop)
He on your fuckin' ringtone? Is that the shit that you do? Touchin' yourself, lookin' at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin' his interviews, I don't know what the fuck lately got into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder, forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma, daycare after school and she never did charge you
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up, you know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm plannin' on aimin', goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress, I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion, since you like rappers that's killin' that pussy, I'm killin' myself
[Outro: Lil Wayne and Kendrick Lamar]
She say, ""Ooh, Daddy, ooh,"" Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh), Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that could cover for me
Yeah, got some game from my dad
He said she might say she love me
She don't love me like she say she love me
Believe me, believe me
I'm that nigga, boy they love me in the streets
I'm not tryna find nobody else to beat
I'm the one they come to see because they all
Believe me

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, rip, rip rip
It's been me and Young Tune off the rip
That's the man that put me in this shit
If a nigga fuck with him, I'll put him down quick
Got a verse for anybody wanna talk about the clique
I've been takin' shit light, you don't wanna hear me trip
God damn, do y'all really know who y'all fuckin' with?
Yeah, I mean you can't blame me for wonderin'
Doesn't matter, could be winter or the summer
On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though
I was like, ""Hah, it's our time, nigga""
He left Rikers in a Phantom, that's my nigga
And I'll been rockin' with the team 'til Carter IX
And we YMCMB, waitin' on somebody to try us, nigga
Yeah

His and hers Ferraris, nigga
One for me, one for my daughter, nigga
Waitin' for someone to test me like a Harvard nigga
I tote a 223, two Michael Jordans, nigga
Come on, fight these shell cases like a lawyer, nigga
Find out where you stay, and act like we found some oil, nigga
Out of duct tape so when he prayin' I ignore the nigga
All I gotta say is ""sayonara, nigga""
Drop dead gorgeous but the bitch ain't dyin' for a nigga
Where the real queens at? Shout out Capone and Noreaga
We can shoot it out and see who live to tell the story later
Diamonds in my Rollie face cannot be exfoliated
They think I'm associated, I'm the one that orchestrated
Yayo get her ass whipped, whip that ass like horses racin'
Ain't 'bout what you walk away from, it's 'bout what you walk away with
Dead Presidents, them coffins vacant
I must be doin' somethin'

I had to get it poppin' off the rip
I'm the one they tell yah been reppin' in the 6
Come into the city and yah niggas get to trippin'
We'll take yah to the Scarborough Bluff and drop you off a cliff
Well damn, just be happy for the man
Nirvana, Coldplay, nigga got bands
Ink from the money, got it all over my hands
Goin' out to Houston, spendin' all of my advance
V Live just took me for a cheque
""Drake you know I love you, you just took me outta debt""
Yes, right now you are lookin' at the best
Mothafuck award shows and mothafuck the press like that
[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Mothafuck the rest
When they jumped off the porch, I was stumblin' up the steps
I'd give what I collect before I give up my connect
It'd be a cold day in Hell, icicles made of sweat
One finger, slidin' 'cross my neck
Niggas know what that mean like they deaf
Nigga I'll fire this nina like it's her first day
On the job and the bitch overslept
Tune stay humble, nigga I'm a king
Need a horn and a drumroll
They throw mothafuckin' roses at my feet, nigga
I don't step on one rose
I'm the only one that get the job done
I don't know a nigga that can cover for me
Tape a couple kilos to the bitch stomach
She look like she got a bun in the oven from me
Preheat, believe me
All you gotta do is pay me every week
I had these bitches havin' babies every week
I'm the nigga, see me skatin' in the streets

Ahem, excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy ‘cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted ‘cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit

Okay, I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these motherfuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real Gs move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell

Word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean
Get some Dramamine

Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I played the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you nigga's the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', now I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggas out they mind
I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love
Keep throwin' my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side

Nigga try me, that's a dead-ass pussy
Since y'all motherfuckers so blind to the fact
To tell you the truth, I don't care who's lookin'
All I know is I love my bitch
And pussy feel just like Heaven on earth
Six feet deep, dick shovelin' the dirt
RIP: Rest In Pussy
Light that shit, then pass that shit, we gon' get so smoked out
And then I went, got locked up, every night, I dreamt I broke out
One time for them pussy niggas, that's that shit I don't like
We eatin' over here nigga, fuck around and have a food fight
And that's 2 Chainz
[Chorus: 2 Chainz, Lil Wayne & Both]
Look at you (Uh), now look at us (Yeah)
All my niggas look rich as fuck (What?)
All my niggas live rich as fuck (What?)
All-all my niggas look rich as fuck (Yeah)
Look at you, now look at us (Get the fuck out y'all bitches, straight up)

Bangladesh
Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

[Verse 1]
A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
‘Cause I don't write shit, ‘cause I ain't got time
‘Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers: ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em ‘cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill
[Verse 2]
A million here, a million there
Sicilian bitch with long hair, with coke in her derriere
Like smoking the thinnest air
I open the Lamborghini, hopin' them crackers see me
Like, ""Look at that bastard Weezy!""
He's a beast, he's a dog, he's a mothafuckin' problem
Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'
On some faggot bullshit: call 'em Dennis Rodman
Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!
Never answer when it's private, damn, I hate a shy bitch
Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

[Chorus]
Motherfucker, I'm ill

[Verse 3]
See, they say I'm rappin' like B.I.G., Jay, and 2Pac
André 3000, where is Erykah Badu at? Who that?
Who that said they gon' beat Lil Wayne?
My name ain't Bic, but I keep that flame, man
Who that one that do that, boy?
You knew that true that, swallow
And I be the shit, now you got loose bowels
I don't owe you like two vowels
But I would like for you to pay me by the hour
And I'd rather be pushin' flowers
Than to be in the pen sharin' showers
Tony told us this world was ours
And the Bible told us every girl was sour
Don't play in her garden and don't smell her flower
Call me Mr. Carter or Mr. Lawn Mower
Boy, I got so many bitches, like I'm Mike Lowrey
Even Gwen Stefani said she couldn't doubt me
Motherfucker, I say ""Life ain't shit without me""
Chrome lips pokin' out the coupe, look like it's poutin'
I do what I do, and you do what you can do about it
Bitch, I can turn a crack rock into a mountain — dare me
Don't you compare me, ‘cause there ain't nobody near me
They don't see me but they hear me
They don't feel me but they fear me
I'm illy, C3, 3 Peat143Embed"

Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]
Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will
[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Yeah

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""whine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

[Hook: Drake]

Don't cry, don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: ""Don’t cry, stay tuned.""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry), don’t go (Why, oh why?)
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry, don't cry)
I fuckin' love you, woah (Don't cry, don't cry)

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll
[Chorus: XXXTENTACION & Lil Wayne]
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)
Won't lie (Don't cry), I fuckin' love you, woah
(Triple extension on my motherfuckin' afterlife, rest in paradise)
Don't cry (Don't cry, don't cry)
Don't go (Why, oh why, oh why?)

Yeah, I put my shades on

[Verse 1]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

Stunna, I got 'em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm Edward with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum
Yea, big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks, and motherfuckers eavesdropping
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clotting

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?

Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker

And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Just look up, bro, there the Scuds go

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside
[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne & Eminem Eminem]
So I could pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Haha, yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
I'm gone

[Bridge: Eminem]
It hurts, but I never show, this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Oops, time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy, this crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes, I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time and I
Came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod, I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie, permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk, you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—
[Chorus: Lil Wayne, Lil Wayne & Eminem Eminem]
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Yeah
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker

But if she get greedy, I'ma starve her to death
Top down, it's upset
Been fucking the world, and nigga, I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest

A little louder, yeah

[Chorus]
You had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner, tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

[Verse 1]
When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

[Chorus]
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love
[Verse 2]
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

[Chorus]
You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

[Bridge]
See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out

Lollipop, lollipop, breastses just like Dolly Parton
She ride my spaceship 'til she hit the top
That hit the spot
'Til she ask, ""How many li-i-li-i-licks do it take"" 'til she get to shop?
Don't worry why my wrists got so freeze
Tell a girl, ""Like Doritos, that's not 'cho cheese""
Tell her friends, ""Like Fritos, I'm tryin' to lay""
I can't only have one, and I ain't trying to wait
This a song with Wayne, so you know it's gon' melt
But you ain't finna murder me like everybody else
I'ma rap like I got some type respect for myself
I don't do it for my health, man, I do it for the belt
Man, I do it to the death, 'til the roof get melt
Hundred degrees, drop the roof, so the coupe don't melt
Man, the flow so cold, chicken soup won't help
We need four more hoes, we need oh, oh, oh, oh!
You know what it is when we out of town
We balling too serious, and you out of bounds

And she gonna lick the rapper
And I just wanna act like a porno-flicking actor

I got so much chips, I swear, they call me ""Hewlett Packard""
I got so much chips, you can have a bag if you're a snacker
Greedy mother-fudge cake; now, tell me how that fudge tastes
I do it for Bloods' sake—soo-woo!
Think it's voodoo how that roof do di-di-dissipate
Your girl want to participate
She so, so sophisticate, 'cause her brain is off the chain
And then, my diamonds are in the choir because they sing from off my chain
And my Nina just joined the gang because all she do is bang
Like Ricky Martin; Wayne and Kanye: pick your poison
If that woman wanna cut, then tell her I am Mr. Ointment
Tell her to make an appointment with Mr. I-Can't-Make-An-Appointment
Take my lollipop and enjoy it—remix!

Why would she? She probably be the odd cookie
In the plastic bag 'bout to get crushed by a building
I've flushed out the feeling of me being the shit
'Cause I was leaving skid marks on everywhere I sit
I am everywhere, I'm it, like Hide-and-Go
And I can go anywhere: eeny, mini, miney, mo
I'm in your neighborhood, area, CD-thing, tapedeck
​iPod, your girlfriend, and she say I got great sex
Safe sex is great sex, better wear a latex
'Cause you don't want that late text, that ""I think I'm late"" text

Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung

Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro

Uh, my mind's filled with mine fields

It's Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yeah, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin', yeahh
My country 'tis of thee
Sweet land of kill em all and let 'em die

This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

[Verse 2]
Damn, military minded, lost and can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
'Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket
I'm wired out the socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want – I took heed, yeahh
Now let it breathe, yeah
[Verse 3]
Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, love
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut, in a nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Same shit, different air freshener
I don't play, boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind
I be in the cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked the clock and let it come to time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of command, I'm the missing link

God bless Amerika
This ole' godless Amerika
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

Here we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was lookin' for me, I'ma hide by a broad
Shootin' stars in my pocket; bitch, sit on my rocket

What's on your mind? Put the pistol to your mind and blow your mind
Control your mind, mind freak, no sober mind, I'm so behind
But front line, you crossed the line, and you better know your lines
And if you gettin' out of line, I hang you with a clothin' line
Wring you like an open line, keep your stanky ho in line
Them hoes be lyin', it's a thin line, and I know you know the line
Second line, second line, Tunechi got effective lines
Rough edges like a box of Checkers fries, that's a line
Catch the line, American flag, less stars, extra lines
Stretch the line, skip the line, 'til you no more next in line
Yeah, Tunechi-Tune a lunatic, my goonie-goons the gooniest
Run inside your room and kill you and who you roomin' with
The Uzi with the booty clip, more than one, I'm too equipped
Talkin' 'bout some fake niggas, based on true events
Tryin' not to get pinched, smokin' on a stupid stench
Lookin' in the mirror tryin' to figure where my pupils went

Out of all the rankless, I was chosen
When all of the lights, they get low
And all of the curtains, they close

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They can do all they can do but they can't break unbreakable
They scared to face the truth because they hate the view
They taste the juice, I hope it make 'em puke, I'm breakin' loose
Should I throw up the deuce or should I wave the deuce?
In 1982, my momma taped me to a space shuttle
Say, now I'm raising you and ain't no baby food
Unless you go and take the neighbors' food
And be afraid of who, I made the loot
When money went from army green to navy blue
I said salute, bulletproof, I gave 'em proof
Sometimes feel like my head a screw, twisted like tornadoes too
Man, I'ma need some Krazy Glue
Her walls is what I'm breaking through
Her nails, she gone break a few
You can never break me down, and I can't hit the brakes for you

You emulate, I'm laughing in your face
Now fix your face, I can't disintegrate, 'cause I facilitate a mil' a day
For like a million days
At least the bills are paid, the children safe
Want to get away? No, I'm here to stay
I'm really great, but don't discriminate
'Cause I done seen a mirror break behind a pretty face
You stickin' out your chest, your titties fake
Don't make me pick your fate
I'm pickin' out a mate, she get replaced
The heart was built to break
I'm smoking icky, watching Ricki Lake
I got a lawyer that turn any case into a pillow case
My killers straight, let's do some Q&A
You saw the news today
Got news to break and rules to break
It hurt to say, they want to get Lil Tune to break
It's worth the wait, commercial break

Woo, this that shit they didn't want me on
I'm 'bout to act a badonkadonk, shamone, shamone
Don't need sugar, I need cream, I'm dark and strong
The garbage man puttin' on cologne, aroma wrong
I'm on, I'm on, this that shit they didn't want
I act a ass and shit a skunk, I will, I won't
Black your eye like will.i.am, you Willy Wonka
That's me in the Lamb', I'm disappearin' like Jimmy Hoffa
AK-47 my business partner, business is swell
French kiss a bitch, she don't speak French, can't kiss and tell
I push his ass in a wishin' well, then wish him well
Sippin' syrup like ginger ale, but I'm the quickest snail
From here to Hell, I hear them hail, I give them hell
I'm spittin' hail, I'm Clinton, well, I did inhale
These niggas frail, they Chip and Dale, they little gals
Watch me act a donkey, then pin a tail, spit out your nails

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the holy shit, I'm God's manure
I know how to hack a jeweler ward and not computers
I meditate like a Buddhist, holy ramen noodles
And now you sleep, I'm inside your room wit' a lot of shooters
You wake up to this chopper tool, it's like, ""cock-a-doodle""
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, glory unto you (Glory)

[Verse 2]
I'm awkward, cuckoo, I turn your Froot Loop to chocolate Yoo-Hoo
I'm hotter than Honolulu, my clothes and socks and shoes new
I been a boo-boo since ga-ga goo-goo and Dada, FUBU
Make everybody that knew you boo-hoo, I got them spooked too
I drive in neutral, shock the future like Dr. Luther
I'm not a chooser, your mom a cougar, I'll sock it to her
My cocaine white as a white beluga, I like bazookas
I'm high as lunar, I'm wilder than tigers, Nikes, Pumas
Woo, this that shit you didn't want me on
My weed louder than underarms and car alarms
Cheers, I said, ""Surprise,"" but couldn't party long
I got to get back to the grind and the drawin' board
But all this fuckin' artist drawin' is the art of war
These niggas soft as teddy bears, talk to Marky Mark
I wet your block, leave it a waterpark, broad or dark
I whip the work like tartar sauce, you want it hard or raw, huh?

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I'm the shit, Porta-Potty Tunechi
Unload the Glock profusely when sortin' out confusion
Your motor mouth keep vroomin', I'm goin' Tony Stewart
I'm on the fluid, I'm ruined, I'm cold as Boston Bruins
Lost in the shoo-shoo and who's who and I lost influence
Lost my point of view 'til I find a mirror, start talkin' to it
It told me the truth, it said I'm the shit and you party poopin'
Lord, oh, Lord
[Verse 3]
Am I talkin' crazy? Too much coffee maybe
I smell like money, I know broke niggas feel nauseated
The broads elated, my boys are faded, my car's the latest
My bars the greatest, they rated X like Marvel made it
She caught the babies, she barfed the babies, they orphans maybe
We got that white girl like in the '80s, that Marcia Brady
I dicked Tracy like Warren Beatty, I'm warm as Haiti
I'm armed and lazy, I'm sprayin' until my arms is lazy
Pardon my mental, I'm higher than Continental
Went from flyin' cockroaches to flyin' without credentials
That's private, tell the pilot, ""Be quiet, we need our privacy""
Throw you off this bitch if you wired, justifiably
Hustle wit' a motive, you know this, I'm wit' my whoadies
No snakes, no rodents, no ad-libs, no chorus
No stress, no worries, hook you to a respiratory
It's self-explanatory, the glory is mandatory, glory

[Interlude]
Uh, glory, hallelujah
Holy shit, I can't hold this shit, my bowel's looser
My towel's newer, my powder room is for powder-users
You see rolled up dollar bills filled wit' snot and mucus
My tires Lucas, my driver's cruisin', my partner's ruthless
My flower's rootless, my pocket's roofless, she poppin' roofies

Fifty mill' in one room (huh?)
You, you could ask anyone out here who running the game?
And they’ll tell you the truth, man, they tell you (and they tell you)
Oh look, they fuck with me now (hey)
I think they’re hearin' me now (yeah)
Someone said, ""Nigga, they takin' you seriously now""
I’m like, ""I think they just might be scared of me now"" (might be scared of me now)
But it’s all good, niggas wrong every day (every day), niggas wrong every day (true)
Gone, goin' to LA where I’m tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ain’t ever have to play it safe (nope)
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe
Then peek inside the safe and see I’m runnin' out of space
Mothafucka, that’s grindin'
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Nigga I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Grindin’ for all my shit
Yeah, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I put time into all this shit
Man, I’m grindin’ for all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit
Perfect timing with all my shit
I’m grindin’ for all my shit

[Bridge: Lil Wayne]
(Grindin’, grindin’) Perfect timing

I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe
Then peek inside the safe and say I’m running out of space

Scoob, find another oo-wop
Tell them niggas cool out
'Cause it can be a mohafucking shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out

Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out
Flying out the crew out, they flew out
Invite 'em to my new house, my new house

You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a king on his throne
When you’re chained in the dark all alone?

I’m real as they come, I follow the rules
I’m still in the hood but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don’t fuck around
I just felt they needed me so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
'Cause my godson just became my real son
Think life is a game but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I’m pushin' the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don’t sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline, propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin' on cocaine
So in other words, nigga, do your thing

[Verse 2: Drake]
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he’s just angry at you niggas
Who don't have your heart in your rap shit
And got too fuckin' comfy
'Cause we still fuckin' hungry, Young Money, got the munchies
Faded, fuckin' faded, aw yeah I'm fuckin' faded
They tellin’ lies about me, aw yeah, I must've made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin’ in that shit hole
Three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin' all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder

I know you fake, nigga, press your brakes, nigga
I’ll take you out, that’s a date, nigga

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all the scenes in this movie, and she blows it at the end
She keeps talking to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearing it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
When you broke up with your boyfriend, man, fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggas
And you still went and fucked them other niggas
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you, I thought that we was cool
If you need a shoulder to cry on, girl I won't listen
I'm through fucking with these bitch ass bitches

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it ""Waynes"" it pours
No really, I'm on my ""fuck that bitch"" shit
You used to be the shit, but now you ain't shit, bitch
I had a red bone, but she be tripping though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeon toed
She used to always say, fuck my niggas
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggas
Well, I guess I'm single for the night
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this shit explains that you're the one that taught me
[Hook: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch that owe you everything
At least a wedding ring, moving on to better things
So don't you call me talking bout them other fools

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well, and I wish I never met ya
And I heard you're doing you, and you heard I'm doing better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not forever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was working doubles
I wish you the best, good luck boo
Weezy F, for ""Fuck you""

[Bridge: T-Pain]
No ain't nothing going on
Girl I'm moving on, just take your ass home
Get away from here girl, I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writing for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round me all you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya, cause girl done taught me

[Verse 1]
Sitting on the world, I got life in my hand
So these days I try to think twice when I can
Money on my mind as God as my witness
Love don't live here and it don't even visit
I do this for my Uptown politicians
Walked in the kitchen and found a pot to piss in
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama missin'
Niggas ain't satisfied until they mama miss 'em
Uh, I'm a monster, exorcisms
Tote tools like mechanics, mechanisms
Uh, detrimental on any instrumental
I say you rappers sweet I pay the incidentals
I'm beneficial, I've been official
I say you rappers sweet, tiramisu
I like my short cake shorter
Ain't no motherfucker harder than

Nobody gives you a chance, you gotta take chances
Your family tree, I will break branches
Cause I don't give a fuck, I put the ass in assassin
Smoke you like a blunt then it's ashes to ashes
The future is born, put the past in the casket
If real shit is dead then nigga I'm a bastard
Uh, appetite for disaster
I want a full plate then another plate after
Uh, yesterday just died
Tomorrow never cried, the days of our lives
When shit get deep I'm never afraid to dive
Let the money pile up until I'm buried alive
Ask who the fuck want it, I bring it to your doorbell
Have niggas in ya yard like a yard sale
Smoking weed, getting head in the oval office
I changed the stars on the flag into crosses

Amen, so now instead of pledge, we pray, yeah

Ya dead to me, brown grass nigga
I just stand still and let the ground pass nigga
Bullshit for lunch, brown bag nigga
Reality’s a bitch and I'mma dance with her
140 pounds, 5'6 from the ground
Bitch I'm in the building you ain't even in the lounge
I tried to fuck the world and couldn't even get aroused
I ain't looking for the beef but I ain't seen it in a while
Uh, and we all want world peace
Murder show, I give your ass good seats
Shit, I'm much more than a good speech

Gorillas in suits
The holy war, the spiritual troops
Fighting over the mythical truth
Drowning in the political soup
They shoot missiles and nukes
Taking out such a pivotal group
The body count is the physical proof
And they thought drugs were killing the youth, [chuckles]

But baby lets face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
They like it in a head lock fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side
Feelings to the side like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel-crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach came back in a jet

Woo! OW!

And this that Sorry 4 The Wait 2
Yeah, and I'm sorry for the wait, too

'Cause I can't save you (I can't save you)

It'll suck you dry like raisins, Lord
But fuck that, nigga, got it drawn out
Fuck that nigga, I'ma ball out
The day you met me is the day Hell froze
On the day I left is when it thawed out (ayy!)

You've been down since day one
It meant nothin' on day two (damn)
Sometimes the truth is hard to swallow, and to say, too
But I graduated from that bullshit, now I hate school

Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Work out, yeah
I'm in this bitch
Yeah, was on the outside, looking in this bitch
But now I’m in this bitch
Yeah, I'm in this bitch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a genius
Looked in the mirror said
""Don't let the money come between us""
I’m loaded, loaded at my earliest convenience
But fuck 'em, I feel like I got ten middle fingers
I'm sippin', sippin' in this bitch and poppin' uppers
Girl, take this, this that shit that give a flower color
And some bitch named Wonder Woman told me not to wonder
The crumbs, you only see 'em when the cookie crumble
Real shit, nigga, my candle still lit
Had to swallow my pride, though, swear it tastes like spearmint
Big up to my nigga with a strap on 'em
I never turn my back on ’em
’Cause nigga act like they cool with ya
But a lot of these niggas be transformers
A lot of these players be bench-warmers
The game ain't easy, but it’s fair, nigga
I'mma sit in this throne so long
'Til it's a fucking rocking chair, nigga
Bad bitch play with my hair, nigga
Said, ""Relax, Tune, baby don’t stress out""
But I got a lot of shit on my mind, though
She said, ""Let that shit work itself out""
""Let that shit work itself out""
[Interlude 1: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
C5
Yeah, back in this bitch
Tune you left this bitch
Like you knew this bitch was gon' let your ass back in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
But ain't nobody else like you in this bitch
Let it all work out, let it all work out
Let it all work out
Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Cita, you a psychic
'Cause you said there be days like this
They want a piece of me, I ain't the one that's serving slices
Please swallow, I had my share of dirty diapers
Real shit, pussy niggas on that guilt trip
It'll be on in a heartbeat
You can't hear no pussy nigga's shit skip
I fear God, never fear men
Give back, never give in
Beat odds, never beat women
Keep an open mind, let 'em peek in it
Reach highs, never reach limits
Need minds, I don't need plenty
This C5, this for BI and Left Eye, and T-Boz
When I seen Chilli at the Floyd fight
I almost asked her to creep with me
But I was young, and I held my tongue
But with that tongue, I just keep spitting
So it all worked out
[Interlude 2: Lil Wayne & Sampha]
And now I'm in this bitch
And life said, ""Tune, you knew me for way too long""
I never change, you know I been this bitch
And then she said, ""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out, let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out, let it all work out""

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tunechi, you a monster
Looked in the mirror, but you wasn't there, I couldn't find ya
I'm lookin' for that big, old smile, full of diamonds
Instead, I found this letter you ain't finished writin'
It read, ""I'm sorry for even apologizing""
I tried, compromising and went kamikaze
I found my momma's pistol where she always hide it
I cry, put it to my head and thought about it
Nobody was home to stop me, so I called my auntie
Hung up, then put the gun up to my heart and pondered
Too much was on my conscience to be smart about it
Too torn apart about it, I aim where my heart was pounding
I shot it, and I woke up with blood all around me
It's mine, I didn't die, but as I was dying
God came to my side and we talked about it
He sold me another life and he made a prophet
[Outro: Lil Wayne & Sampha & Jacida Carter]
Yeah, and he said
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
(Yeah, thank God 'cause I'm still in this bitch)
""Let it all work out""
Let it all work out (Phew)
""Let it all work out""
(But he said, ""Remember this:"")
""Let it all work out""
""Let it all work out""
(""Ain't nobody else like you in this bitch"")
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""And don't forget what I did this, bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""Can't even remember when I didn't, bitch"")
""Let it all—""
""Let it all work out"" (Yeah)
""Let it all work out""
(""Now I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all work out""
(""I'm out this bitch"")
""Let it all—""
(""And it all worked out"")

My tongue go brrrr, my dick go bahh, bitch!

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Lay on the bed, open that twat
I French kiss that pussy, like muah
Sit on my face, M-U-A-H
Before I eat that pussy, I say my grace
Girl I'm nastier than him, I don't know why you still with him
Beat that pussy, go to sleep, she got that Tylenol P.M
Fuck that bitch until she tired, 'til she tired like a rim
Give her head like a brim, it tastes good, M-M-M
Pussy monster in her closet, full of surprises
I give full body massages, I hope that pussy smell like a violet
I hope that pussy warmer than luke and sweet as Godiva
Suck this dick and swallow that nut and call it Penis colada
Lift up that mini-skirt, that's my dinner desert
She fell in love with the Martian, I said you too down to Earth
Man, these hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

My tongue is a uzi, my dick is a AK
Down here waiting for her to come like payday
Hoping this juice is sweeter than baked cake
She say it's for Tunechi, she lie with a straight face
But I'm trying to eat healthier, so I ate a veggie
Sucked on that pussy, I feel better already
She say ""Tunechi go slower"" and Tunechi went faster
My tongue is a motor, my dick is a NASCAR
Whipped cream on that pussy, dickhead like a bullet
If her hair real I'mma pull it, hope that ass feel like a cushion
I give her wood when he wouldn't? I hope that pussy tastes like pudding
And I get that ho the boot, hold up, let me put my foot in (Tunechi)
Got a sweet tooth, candy yam pussy
I'mma leave that ass smoking like a Amsterdam tourist man
These hoes love Wayne, got a bunch of dimes, that's chump change
This shit is target practice and your bitch is my gun range

Lay on that bed, open your mouth
This pussy so clean like soap in your mouth
I do my lil' dance, he scoping me out
If that dick like a tree watch me build a treehouse
Ok, the baddest bitch in this bitch, got the fattest clique in this bitch
You might drown, you better start doggy paddling in this bitch
I'm Trin, B nigga? Queen nigga, sleep in this pussy, dream nigga
I stay on that dick like a fucking balance beam nigga
Hair pull, neck grab, don't fuck with hoes that backstab
Don't fuck with niggas that ain't got shit, if I fucked a nigga then that's my dick
My mouth a jacuzzi, my pussy a safe place
Fuck me 'til daybreak, then you can go skate, Trina14Embed"

Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—
Oh— Oh, yes, I love her like—

[Verse 1]
Oh, yes, I love her, like Egyptian
Want a description? Her body's sickening
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician
Sexual healing: I can be her religion
And now, she's kneeling, praying to the ceiling
I bless her as if she sneezed—must be the weather
I dress her: I am her sleeves, I am her feathers
She's fly—flyer than you, flyer than me
I love her; she loves me, too; I love her three times
More than her mom; time will tell that I'm the nigga that
She should—we should be wherever she wanna be on a
Late night, midday, A.M., just say when
And I know I be with cavemen, but never mind them
She's ""Poison,"" and I am Michael Bivins
See, I know that y'all don't hear me, but she does; we does
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink, and I think
We done had too much to drink, and
[Chorus]
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed

[Verse 2]
Oh, yes, I love her like I ought to
I see you at the altar, Mrs. Carter
I see you with my daughter, or son—more than one
Maybe five, like the Jacksons, or John Paxson
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion
And Daddy will be home later on
Smelling like the cologne that I put on this morn
And I hope that you smell like woman's soap and shampoo
And lotion and perfume and candles
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal, yes
I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever—wow!
Leave her to me, and she'll be smiling every single time you see her
From ear to ear
I want to be beside her when she sleep as she lay
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day
Clothes are overrated; panties are debated
Einstein: Her head is the greatest
[Chorus]
(Oh, yes, I love her like) Pussy, money, weed

[Verse 3]
Oh, yes, I love her like her dad told her no man would ever love her—oh, and
I better be the only man sticking it
Licking it like an envelope; mailing it, sealing it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret—don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody—not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it—that ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station, we have sex orientation
When I hit it, she squint like them Orient Asians; I do me
I say, ""Hey, Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty—
Roll, like sushi""; I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
""Ah""s, ""Ooh-wee""s
""Voila""s, ""Ta-da""s, ""Mhm""s, ""Uh-huh""s
""Oh, yeah""s, never ""Oh, no""s until I have to go
And then it's: ""Never! Oh, no!"" I tell her, ""Don't cry—
I be back like the electric bill""
And when she butt-naked, she dressed to kill

As I wipe the stars off the windows on my space ship
Call out the spirits in my basement
Crawl out the center of the snake pit
And fall into the middle of her greatness
Fireballs reflect off the frames of the pictures
She's not at all impressed with the flames or the flickers
But take her for a walk on the moon she wear her slippers
The end of the world is coming soon, I’ma miss it
The sky is falling down, I am falling for her quicker
We hide amongst the clouds, then we pardon the enigma
High above the ground but I'm under her charisma
Her sound is in surround when I'm in her solar system
The quiet calms my quasars, the eclipse is eclipsin’
My astronaut helmet kinda shifted, full of lipstick
Planet of the aches, and she is my prescription
We out of this world, baby, we have been evicted
[Chorus: Lil Wayne / Lil Wayne & Nicki Minaj]
Intergalactical love
The sky is falling, intergalactical, intergalactical love
And I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you
On the dark side of the moon
Said I'll be waiting, I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon
And if you happen to get there before me
Leave a message in the dust just for me
If I don't see it I'll be waiting for you
On the dark side of the moon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Open up the curtains
Window-watchin', people killin', robbin’
The sky is fallin’, fallin' down
I turn into news, and this is the apocalypse
People livin’ on their rocket ships
My mama always told me that there would be no stoppin' this
Fireball reflections on the friends and the pictures in my room
Of I and you
Tell me, will I see you soon?
Meet you on the moon?

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & (Lil Wayne) / Both]
Intergalactic love
The sky is falling, falling down
I'll be waiting for you, for you, for you

Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that she feel some type of way
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away
Sometimes life is hard to swallow, but she like to taste
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding my lawyer fight the case
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase
Monsters in my closet no more closet space
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a water-park
Every little thing I do turn her on; that's autostart
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future
And she said, ""Tune, not in my mouth,"" damn you should've said it sooner
I be shittin' on these niggas, like I'm sippin' Metamucil
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like ""excuse you""
And it's 6-6-2's Piru all day, my nigga
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead, my nigga
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly

Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait
We can't even have a decent conversation
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I pop the seal on my sip and she be like, ""See, you gon' drink your life away""
Bitch it's my life, my life, my life shout out Mary J
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates
I hope that ho don't call sayin' her cycle late
All this fucking gotta stop, but I need tighter brakes
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face
And she ain't all that pretty, but I like her shape
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a 8
She say she ain't no dyke, but she gon' dyke today
It's curtains for these niggas I feel like some drapes.

Yeah, skate rebel, gun at my waist level
Bitch yellow, tape yellow, give you an H-A-L-O
I don't do pussy niggas but get the most pussy, nigga
I'm popping Percs, I'm sipping lean, smoking pot like cooking dinner
My homie T roll up my blunt, skinnier than Rex Ryan
I'm counting money, I'm smoking plants, call that shit ""math and science""
Now suck dick, Trukfit, snapback on your dog ass
These niggas broke like Mr. Glass, they don't want none, Sister Act
It's Young Money, you bitch, you; my weed louder than pimp suits
Your bitch swallow my pimp juice, her pussy wetter than swim suits
Swish! Michael... Phelps, nigga, in your ho
Coupe the color of YooHoo; rude boy—free Buju
Fuck wrong with these fuck niggas? I been balling since '98
Fuck y'all I'd rather skate, shoot you up in your database
I fell in love with drop-tops, I fell in love with shotguns
Our guns bigger than cop guns; y'all ain't spitting, dry tongue
I like wet pussy, she like hard dick, hard head make her soft fast
Tatted up from head to toe, guess you can call me a mark-man
Wayne soaring, all my whores is whoring
All you rappers is boring, Trukfit hat and some Jordans, ugh!

[Intro: DJ Drama]
Shout to Chi-Town!
Dedication 5!
Since '05!
Know that!
[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass with your fine ass
You fine as two grapes gettin' stomped out by a giant cask
You the best dressed with your breasts showing
Like a salad, no dressing, take you to your favorite restaurant
Ask for the bread, then fuck in the restroom
They don't ask for a pass when your ass waltz in my dress room
You the best bride and I'm the best groom
Wedding presents got my best man at the Best Buy
Buyin' the Best of Fresh Prince for the bedroom
And I'ma buy a summer house, with a rec room
And a car with no backseat and some leg room
And some strawberries and some chocolate
And a fridge and some broccoli
'Cause I know you like vegetables even though I don't
I won't say I won't eat it if you chef it
Fuck it, I'll hire Geoffrey to get a beverage if you should ever get parched
You feel like Ruby Dee to me, great and powerful Ossie
Who's behind the man behind the curtain? Foxy, coffee
Brown as the bosom I flew in on
Nose round like the wheels that my rims spin on
Lips full like the light on the dash was flickin', oh wait, it wasn't
Oh, and I forgot, I'll take a microwave or oven
So we could kick the butler out and we can make a muffin
Maybe bake a dozen
My homeboy like your sister, maybe they can bake some cousins
Ooh, isn't that sweet?
You feel like Kool-Aid in a wine glass
[Hook: Chance the Rapper]
This is not a love song, this is a you song

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Give you the world if it was for me
My diamond grill make it hard to see, I'm lying through my teeth
And now I'm flying on my PJ, looking at the clouds
Thinking about yo ass and how it look like a big smile
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act
But anyway, we can role-play or get straight to it
Sorry, my mind in the gutter—better yet, sewer
And when you say I love you, I stutter, ""I-I love you too""
It's Wayne's world, she say, ""What is this world coming to?""
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other
Then she got serious and said, ""Tune I gotta ask you something
Do you really love me?"" I tried to change the subject
So I said some crazy shit to her like
""What if you and I were just letters?
That'd be unfortunate, we'd have to rob a fortune teller
But I swear, I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket
Okay, that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie
You remind me of... my memory ain't what it used to be""
She said she ain't trippin', I know, because I move my feet
And when she figure out that she been swindled
I'll be cleaning that love bird shit off of my window
I-I love you too...

How many times I gotta
How many times I gotta say it for it to count?
Are you counting?

Cocaine on her navel, lick it so my tongue can go HAM
Put my face up in her pussy and my thumb in her ass
Make her do the jumpman, ayy
I put her face down in the pillow, 'bout to smother her ass
A fly yellow bone to me, I told her to come get a tan
Now she butter pecan
Oh, I got a Draco in the sofa, an Eggo in the toaster
A cradle in the chocha, the yayo doing yoga
And I wake up, smell the Folgers, I don't know how I woke up
'Cause I was in a coma, but now I'm in the moment
Wearing high socks on the front porch
Two cups with the mud flowin'
The plug ain't charge me nothin' for it
I cried tears of fuckin' joy
LVs on my luggage, boy
Don't ask me where I'm fuckin' goin'
I pull up with my skaters
Make 'em beat you with their fuckin' boards
Sharp shooters like pool sharks
Shoot you down in the Walmart
Shoot you down in the parkin' lot
Shoot you down in the food court
Hit your crib in the Steamboat
Then disappear on the speedboat
Act a jackass like Steve-O
Then disappear like Neo
Leave a red flag on your screen door
Leave a red flag around your queen's throat
Leave a blood stain on your mink floor
Like a red stain on clean snow
That money gang, 500 gang on that money train
And we walkin' around with bloody fangs
Playin' hunger games; mmm-yummy, man
And we storm the block, lightning and thunder came
When my youngest came, that's your mother's name
Hit the address, knockin' down picture frames and other things
Throwin' up Eastside like stomach pains
Sugarcane get took to Spain, a kilo fell and it shook the plane
A nigga screamed, the hoes wouldn't complain
I brought the AK with the knife, so the butcher came
And the Nina came, and her sister came
And what's her name, it’ll go Buka Bang
You don't even know where to put the blame, that's cold

Grab life by the horns, put the bullshit aside

Life ain't shit but bitches and money
I pass that weed, like I studied
Bury me in fire and watch me phoenix

You tied to the track of my train of thoughts
And controlling my thoughts is like taming sharks
And these hoes wanna kick it with me, I'm a sensei
And I got fat pockets, you niggas in shape
Tools on deck, tattoos on necks
Life is a bitch, I'll make her your ex
Better turn to God 'fore I turn to Godzilla
How the fuck you gon' talk shit to diarrhea

Put a bug in my ear, but not in my phone
I'll have a broke motherfucker run in your home
For a crumb and a bone

Got the world in my hands, I'mma dribble that bitch

I'm a straight rider with a getaway driver
Hit you dead on the money, now you dead on arrival
I don't fuck with these niggas, too old for new friends
But never too rich for new money
These niggas buying Haterade by the twelve pack

Now I’m looking in my rear view, I see the world in it

And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin'
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my wire like Stringer Bell
I let them be, 'cause you know how the sting’ll feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track: train derail
Know how to roll, never need training wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uh, all or nothing or nothing else
I bleed reality, I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the ""F"" is for ""Fuck yourself""

And I ain’t doing nothing but getting my share, breathin' this air
And Mack moms told me she gon' keep me in her prayers

Ah-em

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I ain't shit
Sometimes a nigga feel like shit
Talkin’ 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
So if a nigga kill me, hope he mean it
I just hope I die for a reason
They probably won't miss me ’til they need me
Have problems with admittin' that they need me, Lord
I'm talkin' 'bout some real life shit
Goodbye letter, ""Dear Life"" shit
Way too concerned to be conceited
I live and I learn, then die tryna teach 'em, Lord
Die tryna reach 'em
They care more about how much I leave than
Where I leave it
I hope I leave more of an impression on my kids
To be destined to have blessings to believe in, Lord
Just got off the phone with my son
Told him, ""You're a son of a gun""
Just got off the phone with my daughter
Told her, ""I won’t hesitate to fuck a young nigga up"", Lord
A few bitches left me, that only got a new bitch elected
My old bitch was too disrespectful
And only get my new bitch respected
That’s power, yes, it's now or next
Can’t lie though, I tried though
I'll die tryin', that's a common death
We was such a team, we was chasin’ our dreams
Then it stopped, now I'm outta breath
Now they try to tell me I need rest
And I'll find love again, I ain't find it yet
Oh, but I guess it is what it is as it appears, oh shit
The object in the mirror is more near than it appears, oh shit
And sometimes I fear who in the mirror, that nigga weird
He done died so many times but still here, why am I here?
[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?

[Verse 2]
Naked bitches really love ones
Sometimes our loved ones don't love us
I'm fuckin' more than I'm makin' love
Sometimes I make my rubber wear a rubber
I just tell my lady, ""Nothing's easy""
Even though I make it look easy
But understand looks are deceiving
Lookin' like I'm lookin' for some grievance
'Cause I been through way too much, don't wanna think about it
Cranky 'bout it, gotta drink about it
Gotta synchronize it, tranquilize it
Doctor ain't prescribin' what he ain't realizin'
Pain inside me got me thinkin' 'bout me
Tryna hang my body, sanctifyin'
I'm a gangsta dyin' 'cause all gangsters die
I can't deny it, you can't tame my lion
I'm a angry lion hangin' by a string, I can't describe it
Feel like a anchor tied to my finger
Got me sinkin' to the bottom of my drink
I know a lotta niggas think I got a lotta niggas
There's strength in numbers but it's honor over strength
I talked to God the other day, he say he got a nigga
So, I look death up in her eye and then I wink
It's way too real, the shit I'm talkin' way, way too real
I hope it gave you chills
The dirt under your feet could be the grave you fill
You don't know how dead you feel 'til you're dead for real
Gettin' high after I paid the bill, lower than a Navy SEAL
Show up with them Navy guns, I hope somebody prayin' for 'em
Price tags no mistakes, somebody payin' for 'em
Ice bath when my face numb, no expression
What's the life expectancy when you don't expect shit?
Mama told me, ""Fuck the world and be so aggressive
Be self-fluorescent, watch these hoes 'cause they so obsessive
Don't get too high to look over blessings
Never come in second, make the most of your seconds
They so precious""
'Cause if we could buy time, every store would sell it
If you want me to read your mind, need correct spelling
I keep it real, niggas better keep it copacetic
Where the weed? I feel like I'm gettin' a sober headache
Lookin' in the mirror at the one that know me better
I was too busy to talk, I wrote an open letter
[Chorus]
Dear Life
What is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question I ask the reader, God bless the reader
Dear Life, what is my meaning? My reason?
That's the question

[Outro: Jacida Carter]
You know, when he told me Toya was havin' a baby, I say, ""Y'all young. You know y'all young."" But I said, ""Be the best father you can be,"" you know. And truly, he is that.17Embed"

She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a drive-by, I'm real, these niggas sci-fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin' short hair
She said she tryna be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoein', but she the only one worth knowin'
And yeah, I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't tripping, but she be tripping
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffing
Look, girl, just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I lick her with no chaser, I pick her out a line up
I just wanted some time, she say, ""Okay, I'm your honor""
But she been wanting to break up since Dolce and Gabbana
All that ass, I just be like, ""Come sit your groceries on my counter""
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it Tijuana
I'm dying to meet her girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond no. 9
The weed is funky, but I'm smelling fine
Tunechi

Oh, is the one that leads back to you

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I got that shit in my system, somebody gon' be my victim
Eh, so where you at with it? 'Cause I can't do it by myself, I need a ass-sistant
I got that good-good, that get right, that early morning, that midnight
I beat it up like a fist fight: one, two, three, four, five, 6-9
That dick all in your windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of your friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind, girl, can't you see? It's meant to be
So come to me, then come for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rolling with two bad bitches 'cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour, my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

Uh, should I call somebody else?
'Cause girl, it's almost 12 and this dick won't suck itself

I'm so on it, and however you want it
You can get it tonight ho, and all night ho
I get the beat from (Maestro), a-fuckin' right, ho!

[Verse]
I might go crazy on these niggas, I don't give a motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What! What! I don't give a motherfuck
Get your baby kidnapped and your baby-mother fucked
It's Tha Carter 3, bitch, better put your supper up
Hollygrove, I throw it up like I'm trying to lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat him up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it, shit
Get on my level? You can't get on my level
You gon' need a space shuttle or a ladder that's forever
However, I'm better, if not now, then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick
Bitch, swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches, I'd have been in that casket
According to the doctor, I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches, like Magic
Abracadabra, I'm up, like Viagra
I just do this shit for my clique, like Adam Sandler
I control hip-hop, and I'ma keep it on my channel
Watch me! Bitch, watch me! Bitch, watch me!
But they cannot-see me, like Hitler
It's the New Orleans nightmare
Money so old, it's growing white hair
Young Money, baby! Yeah, we right here
I'ma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And mama, don't cry, your son can handle his
I got her out the hood and put up in the hills, yeah
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, I got Miss Cita in a better place
When I was fourteen, I told my mom we would see better days
And sure enough, we did exactly what I said
I tell my girl, ""When you fuck me, better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could, she gon' fuck me good""
No sitting at the table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart

And when SportsCenter poppin', everything stoppin'
But you can't fool me, I know what you watchin'

Ahem
Weezy F
Young Money, Cash Money
This is Da Drought 3, ladies and gentlemen
And you know me
Let's go

[Hook]
You know I ride for my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me, ""Don't get high"" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

[Verse 1]
My eyes get so wide as it rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it; if she steal it, I'ma kill her
I bulletproof the ride, now I feel like armadillos
And fuck your hospital — Young Money, we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty, like C-Y-philis
Self-made G, and them bitches know the business
Relying on rap, but in the kitchen I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this, but I just thought that I should mention
You looking for divine and a lil' intervention
And them birds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flying with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimming with the pigeons
See, my world is different, like Dwayne Wayne
And if you want trouble, bitch, I want the same thing
[Hook]
And you know that I’ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don’t worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
‘Cause the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I’m gon' be in it
The sky is the limit (Errrrrrrr!)

[Verse 2]
Buck-ten in the coupe, and your bitch love it
Switching lanes faster than she switch subjects
Tell a bitch, ""Don't talk to me
And if you're talking to them niggas, don't talk for free""
And I hate when a nigga say, ""Talk is cheap""
'Cause I'm the type that let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art — unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on a mind of a shark is ""Eat""
By any means, and you just sardines
I got the 40-cal. tucked in my P-R-Ps
What do you expect? I'm from New Orleans
The majority of my city is riders
They tried to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it, it'll still be ours
[Hook]
And I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
And I'ma tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look up high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit

[Verse 3]
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that's sitting
On the living room sofa — that's fucked up, haha
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulder
Mail it to your Moms with a dozen of roses
Haha, now that's fucked up
And I'm a G
And you ain't got to know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit, but I cannot forget the streets
[Hook]
So you know that I'ma ride with my motherfucking niggas
Most likely, I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
The sky is the limit
Don't worry about mine, I'ma grind 'til I get it
And tell all of my niggas that the sky is the limit
Because the sky is the limit
Yeah, the sky is the limit
And if you look high, you'll see that I'm gon' be in it
'Cause the sky is the limit
They tell me, ""Don't get high"" and I should try to make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler, and I'd rather make a killing

When this shit dropped, I was like 16
Tryna get some head from a mixed thing, big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over
Five dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13s on the whip, kept my shit clean, uh
Actually that was my mama shit
But I’m drivin' 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
Had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But yeah, I’m headed for a scholarship
Little scrap game but I got a lot of lip
That's why them niggas don’t like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely
Uh, I know the game, I’m an expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?

And I ain't fuck yet 'cause her mama always home

No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets, got her singing falsetto
Tall white tee’s, can’t believe we used to wear those

But we was only kiddos
Grabbing titties in the club, pocket full of Skittle

On God, Dedication 6
On God, yeah

[Chorus]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And, bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties
Satin sheets, I ain't got time for no messes
That exorcist told me my wifey possessive
Adderall just so we can go restless
We fuckin' all, all night long, no breakfast
No confessions, no questions, we both professionals
Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrian

[Verse]
You bought a car for the bitch
I buy the narcs for the bitch
You buy apartments and shit
It's nice, I just walked in this bitch
You buy the art for the bitch
Y'all argue too often and shit
You always startin' some shit
That should come off of the bench
Shout out my homies I miss
Nino and Tony and Mitch
This ain't no cordial shit
She wan' come snort all this shit
She wan' go hard with a bitch
She know what happens today
She know we always forget
And she just posted the shit
And he just saw his lil bitch
Tell him I want him to trip
Tell him my guns gettin' skinny
Tell him they're starvin' for this
Give me the check, give me the throne
My hair is a minute too long
My bitch look like Vivica-Berry
Your bitch look like Rosetta Stone
I made my bitch go get a clone
Fuck 'em together and then on they own
When they catch feelings, I’m gone
I'm whippin' the Winnie the Coupe
I'm drivin' and sippin' the soup
The shit made me drift in the coupe
As long as I get to the stu'
Ruler clip, Rick the Ruler slick
Pull up on your bitch, you just called your bitch
Got that ""Who is this?"" She don't know you exist
She on her Mula shit, that's that truer shit
Make you eat your words, make you chew your shit
Then we knockin' out every tooth you pick
Nigga, fuck you, and fuck who you with
Yeah my bitch broke, but her booty fixed
Wait, I just popped a Perc, another for dessert
I washed it down with syrup
I just left planet Earth, ran into Captain Kirk
I pop a Perc, I'm trippy, call me Perc Nowitzki
Just call her Lewinsky; blurry, blurry vision
Blrrp— ""Hello, who is this?"" I just hit the line
I got a bitch in mind, I call her anytime
She taller, but it's fine, together we 6-9
I hit her other line, he like, ""What other line?""
She like, ""Never mind,"" and she can tell a lie
And I can tell she's lyin', that's no lie
That's my awesome lil bitch
Got me a saucy lil bitch
Got me a bossy lil bitch
Left her for a bossier bitch
It cost me a arm and a dick
I got me a naughtier bitch
She suck on the balls and the stick
I'm about to play golf with the bitch
I'm way on Mars with the bitch
She fuckin' with Martians and shit
You shoppin' at Marshall's and shit
And yeah, your bitch gettin' trippy with me
Want a quickie with me
Say she wish that I had Nicki with me
Say she'd lick her with me
Wish you wish I had my nigga with me
Bitch, you washy-wishy, y'all can't trick me
She said ""God, forgive me""
I say ""Nah, I'm busy""
[Bridge]
I got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 bank accounts
Plus a main account, with insane amounts
That's somethin' to think about
Plus the drank in route, now I'm hangin' out
With 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 bitches ready to drink me down
Ready to drink me down, ready to drain me out
Plus my main in town, and she came around
Said they ain't her style

[Chorus]
25 million on a nice big ol' mansion
And bitch, I still haven't invited your family
When you walk in you see the art and gold Grammys
I'ma just kill that pussy, now it's just a closed casket
25 million on a mansion, so precious
Bitch, be careful when you're bringin' your besties

Now ride me like an open road, no pedestrians

OK, No Ceilings, motherfucker, good morning
Dick in your mouth while you're yawning, I'm going in
Gudda, why they started me? Marley, why they started me?
I bring it to your front door like you ordered me
Back in this bitch, but a lot more rich
On my Papa Bear shit, need hot porridge
Got a lot more shit than you can ever fathom
A big-head nigga couldn’t even imagine
The shit I do, most doers never done
I'ma fuck this beat, you bitch, ooh, you better cum
Bet I run this shit, I don't run from shit
I still b—beat your ass like a fucking drumstick
Weezy Fucking Baby, baby, make the ladies come quick
The money can’t fit in my pockets, but I bet that gun fit
And I’m so unfit 'cause all I eat is rappers
And these rappers ain't shit, I like my fast food faster
Syrup got me slow like a turtle 'round this ho
And I'm flyer than the highest-flying bird around this ho
What's the word around this ho? You get served around this ho
Yeah, you get served like a fucking hors d'œuvre around this ho
I don’t splurge around no ho, no, I don’t shine in front of no bitch
'Cause after she get off my dick, I be like ""Find the front door, bitch""
I don't know why in the fuck your bitch keep coming by
I done fucked your bitch a hundred times
What the fuck your bitch got on her mind? My fucking dick
I call her ""dickhead,"" spicy like a Big Red
Strike you like a Bic head—your flow sick? My shit dead
Sillier than V.I.C. said, Soulja Boy and Arab
You should see my eleven-year-old daughter do they dance
I call it the Nae-Nae dance, proud to be Nae-Nae’s dad
Gun on the waistline, leave you in the wasteland
We are not the same, I am a Martian, this is Space Jam
No Ceilings, R.I.P., Amen
Motherfucking caveman, beating on my chest
Young Money, Cash Money, and I'm eating all the rest
Nigga, no offense, sorry if you're offended
Riding high like I'm on 54 inches
Man, I'd rather chill with 54 bitches
Ch—Chill like— Ch—Chill like an Eskimo
L—Let's get more— Let's get more bitches
And I be like, ""Let's get more bitches""
Mr. Officer, stop arresting your bitches
Stop letting the messy hoes mess with your business
Mickey Mouse cheese, hip-hop Walt Disney
Sheesh, gosh, Oshkosh B’gosh
Smoking on that Bob Marley, listening to Pete Tosh
I—I—I do me; no, I do three
At a T... I-M-E
Why, when we say we Young Mula
The bitches leave y'all and relay-run to us
And payday comes sooner than later 'round here
And you see my sharks like they got some bait around here
Hey, you better stop the hate around there
Before Tommy, Mac, and Nina debate around there, yeah
You see it in my face, I don’t care
Whole court hearing, trial, and the case around there
I'm the best thing yet, I know I got that thing wet
Everybody wan' be fly but don’t know where their wings at
Huh, had to pause for a minute
Now, I'm right back in it, like the drawers of the women
On a scale of one to ten'n, my girl be a twenty
My girl so bad, make a nigga think he sinning
My goons so gritty, my goons is so with me
Haters gotta go on iTunes to go get me
Gators, matadors, baboons, and those grizzlies
All come out me when I'm on the micropho-N-E
Mic check, two-three; I'm different like blue pee
And my girls be half naked like Betty Boop be
Like a hoopty, man, the boy been riding
And I ain't gassed up, 'cause I'm more like a hybrid
You think I'm stunting, but no, I'm just surviving
And I been here, but my soul is just arriving
Look up in the air, it's a crow, it's a robin
No Ceilings, full dose, I'm prescribing
Medication free, and for meditation, we
Smoke some better tastin' weed that you’ll ever taste or see
S-H-A-R-P as a tack, hotter than
Riding through the desert on a camel back, I done been
Riding through wherever with the hammer strapped, I ain't lying
I can do whatever if I'm planning that
So I got my guns, let's dance, like FannyPack
And we cook the hard, cut the soft, and bring the whammys back
Mafio, bitch, where your motherfucking family at?
Call my nigga Gudda if you trying to get your mammy back
All up in another nigga woman, I be ramming that
Seeing through these see-through niggas like they're laminate
Hip-hop so contaminate, I swear, just examine it
And I'm such a philanthropist, the God to these evangelists
I dress so Los Angeles, but I love Miami, though
I act so New Orl-e-ans, yes, I go pistachios
That means I go nuts on any beat they throw at me
And the bitches is so at me, and you know what they throw at me

What's the matter? Check your bladder, I'm the shit, piss, nigga
Shoot the witness, nigga
Hold court in the streets and convict this nigga
Ol' dickless nigga
Man, I'm running with the blocka, Young Money, motherfucker
You think we gon' do our thing? Well, ain't it sunny in the summer?
And we coming for the commas, and whoever among us
And you know I'ma bust my ass until my crew very humongous
I said, T.I., hold your head, and Mack, hold your head
Wish I could but I can't say some other names 'cause of the Feds
And to my Bloods, code red, man, you know how we play it
And if it costs to be the boss, oh well, I guess I gotta pay
I—I'm a New Orleans nigga, I don't take no shit
Take the brain off the whip; now, it don't make no sense
Stunt hard on these bitches, I ain't promised tomorrow
Now, women kicking it with me like Nomar Garciaparra
Fuq' roll them killer plants, the Little Shop of Horror
And we roll them bitches thick, make 'em look like Toccara
Man, I'm too much for these niggas and three much for these hoes
The world is in my hands, and I keep my hands closed
I love my baby mamas, they get my highest honor
Gotta take care of them kids, man, I know you heard Obama
And I live on an island, Atlantic in my backyard
I just tell my pilot to land it in my backyard
Quarterback, shotgun, you don’t get any sack yards
Bitch, I ball hard, breaking all the backboards
Pretty Boy Floyd, step up, I will crack yours
And even at the White House, we pull up at the back doors
Walk around like I'm 30 feet tall
Tiger Woods, all these hoes tryna birdie these balls
In the Porsche 911, like emergency calls
Man, I just be chilling, I'm cool like Lou Rawls
Young Money in the building, I'm putting up new walls
Nigga take your Mrs. Officer and set some new laws
My flow is like rubbing two logs
Young Mula, we the new shit, new drawers, ugh
Now, get off my dick, I ain't fucking with you
Watch me shoot to the bank, I'm a money pistol
Weezy beat the beat up like Sonny Liston
Redbone do me good, then her friend assist her
I mean, a bitch she never met, her best friend, or sister
I leave the pussy micro-soft like Windows Vista
Young Tunechi, pop that coochie for a goon, ho
Bullet in you boys' memory, now you act like you don't know
Eastside who I do it for, Eagle Street, right by the store
Katrina wiped the city out but couldn't fuck with Hollygrove
Lost some real niggas I knew from a long time ago
But Heaven or Hell, I'm hoping that they be where I'ma go
Take a nigga gal and make her come give me a private show
Still ""long hair, don't care"" like a Navajo
I'm the hardest shit, go in your ass and search

To Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Uhh

Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood

[Verse 1]
Find out where your parents stay
Tell my goons to go straight to your momma room
What's in your pockets? What's in your pocketbook?
We think the Bible's a comic book
Bitch this Hollygrove, too far from Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
I got cocaine that's so good, need a name? Call it ""Milk""
Because milk does the body good
I got this heat on my waist
So somebody better monitor the thermometer
I just eat pussy and pussy-ass niggas all day
And I ain't even kinda full

[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
[Verse 2]
Woo! I went from Bourbon to Beverly Hills
Show me your tits
I'll show you my weapon and grill and heaven is real
I get an actress into my bedroom
She lay down and say, ""Let's make a film""
I be like, ""Action,"" I hold her head down by her neck
This how breathtaking feel
Family first, you'll get your family killed, that's if you squeal
Pop-pop, close range, hold that gun
Like the photographer hold the camera still
Bad bitch riding my dick
She swerve 'cause another bitch grabbing the wheel
I ask 'em to chill, they both look at me, say ""Shut up""
I say ""My lips are sealed...""
Oooh! I come from Hollygrove, I done went Hollywood
I was a match made in Heaven
When Hell was a pile of wood
I run through Hell with gasoline drawers on
Stop, tell the Devil that God is good
Entrepreneur in a Bentley droptop Azure
Vagina connoisseur out the hood
I come from Hollygrove, every day Halloween
We shoot your block up and just say we shot a scene
This is a robbery, I let the chopper squeeze
Turn you to cottage cheese
Been on my beast since I was wearing Wallabees
Where paparazzi? I need my privacy
Fuck your photography, I react violently
Make sure your camera get my good side of me, Lord!
I come from Hollygrove
Hollywood should make a movie 'bout Hollygrove
Woo! Whoever play me
Should get a Oscar and a Golden Globe
This ain’t no movie, this is real shit
I don’t need a script 'cause I know my role
My Hollywood bitch just overdosed
All she could snort, more coke than Pinocchio
I come from the streets
But got ""superstar"" written all over my face
That's why these hoes in my face
I come from Hollygrove
I moved to Hollywood just to Californicate
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop
I ain't finished shooting, tell 'em don't check the gate
[Chorus]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
Fall asleep to the gunshots
Wake up and smell the embalming fluid
I come from Hollygrove, my bitch from Hollywood
When I fuck her she say ""Hallelujah!""
Hollygrove too far from Hollywood
Ohh, but I done went Hollywood

[Verse 3]
Hollygrove, Hollywood, Hollygrove, Hollywood
Hollygrove ain't far from H-Town
We used to drive back and forth with the work praying
""Lord please don’t let this car break down""
Hahahaha
H-Town! Lord, I done went from Hollygrove to H-Town
Hollygrove to Houston
Got a bad 5th Ward bitch that be boostin'
Sometimes she doze off, that’s the lean, I excuse it
She said ""If it ain't ch-chopped and screwed, it ain't music""
She say I never take her out, we went to eat at Houston's
Sometimes I doze off, that's the lean, I'm just snoozin'
I still got Actavis, nigga, that's exclusive
Kill you for a pint, that's a PT Cruiser
I see way too many hoes in my future
I'm gon' nail all them hoes, I'm Freddy Krueger
Grew up on Bun B, Pimp C was my tutor
Pimp Squad for life, had to do this for Houston
Hollygrove ain't far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth with the work
Praying the car don’t break down
Ohhh, Hollygrove ain’t far from H-town
We used to drive back and forth
With, codeine, cocaine, the pills, and pounds
Yeah, and we got back home safe and sound
If you got pulled over you don't give police no names
Or get killed and never found
Word, but I kept some money to bail out
Momma used to say if I ever get caught
They gon' put me under the jailhouse
Damn, I'm too Hollygrove to go Hollywood
One to the chest with this chopper
Leave you with just arms and a head like a octopus
I got this chopper protecting my livelihood
I'm so good, I'm so straight, I'm secure

When the shit get ugly, I go Pretty Ricky
I don't fuck with rats, neither Minnie, Mickey
I don't fuck with cops, that's the piggly-wiggly
Fuck my bitches' friends, and they friendly-friendly
While your bitch is giving me her twenty-twenty
Like she tired of Mickey-D's, Wendy's, Denny's
Like she tired of Macy's, J.C. Penney's
I got bitches gettin' tired of spendin', spend it
If we winning, win it
I know dreamchasers that ain't never dreamt it
So I had to tint it and I had to rim it
And I worked the lanes like Shaq and Penny
It's the Blood gang, it's the money gang
Red rags to riches, need happy endings
Then it's back to business, and we laugh at sentencing
Hungry lawyers make a snack out witnesses
Hungry artist or a starving artist
In the kitchen, restaurant, and cafeterias
Don't make a difference if you taste the difference
Better pay the difference to the racketeerers
Now your good luck looking like you cracking mirrors
Now the artificial become sacrificial
That's a body count, where the mathematician?
Where the wettest clitoris and fattest nipples?
With an ass that jiggle with a grab or tickle
With a throat deep enough to land a missile
If your nigga miss you and he have opinions
Tell him two cents is only half a nickel
Now we at his villa aiming at his pillows
Hair triggers, fingers finna act like bristles
And the cash, it triple; flip, kick, jiujitsu
Throwing pool parties, she don't have a swimsuit
Neither of her friends do, I think that's official
Got my neighbor's eyes bigger than The Simpsons
And her man a simper, so I had to pimp her
And she had potential but he lacked credentials
So give me a sec, I'll go at your neck
And send you back lookin' like the Dracula bit you, rrr!
Yeah, cannibalism, going animalistic in a land of civilians
These niggas clones, copycats, and chameleons
Once they dead and gone, no paraphernalia
When she left her thong, that's paraphernalia
Sound familiar? My plug Sicilian
He the one who told me that sometimes
You gotta leave your la familia behind the millions
Rhyme or reason, I'm the reason
Got their eyes wide, but too blind to see it
With friends like those
It make me text all my enemies and tell 'em I don't need 'em
Hallelujah, power intruders
Bitch walking 'round my house like Hooters
Towel user, power user
Molly mixed with white girl, Molly/Susan
Niggas talking out their bowel movers
Turn their homies into flower choosers
Turn your kids into father choosers
Make your bitch a widow and your mom a cougar
I'm a silent shooter with a silent shooter
Clap at you, if you don't die, I'll boo you
Tell a doc that's tryna save your life
And running wires through you, he could die next to ya, rrr!
I'ma make the nurse ride me like a giant scooter
Let her partner shoot it
We put out the movie, win awards
She got a Golden Globe head and an Oscar booty
Niggas prostituting
These rappers ain't talkin' 'bout shit, not even 'bout pollution
Ain't got a house to live in, ain't got a pool to swim in
Change in their pockets, nor a couch to lose it
En route to Houston with the contribution
Full of Monster juices, Mazda too slow
Macho, Cujo, macho mucho
Big bad wolf, watch the moon glow, rrr!
I got a Greek freak, she call me Antetokounmpo
Just follow the coupe, ho, and I know that you know
I'm hotter than soup, she still swallow my soup bowl
I'm out of my loophole, you out of the loop though
Got all these niggas on silent and mute mode
The power to do so, my pockets is sumo
Getting the mula by the minuto
Mafia Nouveau, I am the uno
Real boss nigga, should model for Hugo
Fuck with me, I go Lollapaloo-zo
Pull up, trigger finger, holler, and pull-o
Pow-pow-pow, sound like a symphony
Or opera, two-door, hitting some new notes
And I am the maestro, and you just a typo
Private flight, don't fly in too low
I'm wiser than you know, a private school flow
I got me a new ho, and now it's a duo
One went to college and one went to JuCo
I had to ask 'em, ""What's four plus two, though?"" Rrr!
[Outro]
My ultimate basketball dream team
The starting five would most likely be umm
Of course I'ma have to start with Kobe Bryant, umm
This gone take a minute, umm, Chris Paul
Uhh, Shaquille O'Neal, LeBron James
And umm, oh you know I'm gon say Steph Curry, hehe, Steph Curry
You already know that's my starting five, I got money on them

Bust your fucking grape, nigga, turn your shit to red wine
Don't fuck up my high, nigga, I'm too gone, bye nigga
She get dick, weed, and ignored: that's a D.W.I., nigga
My skin crawlin', my walls talkin', the pictures in here lookin' at me
The ground movin', I'm seein' shit, I'm blowin' like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong, got me coughin' like I'm getting buried
I've been fuckin' Mary Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, Mick Jagger, I can run around Saturn
Eyes rolling back, and keep blinking like hazards
I said, ""King me"", king me with my mushroom crown on
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch, look up at my points
I'm trippin' out, cotton mouth, I got high and fell asleep loaded
I woke up and got high again, okay, I'm reloaded, uh

I don't know if I'm coming or going, T, make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashin', life passin', take a bitch home, fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes
My tongue numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth, farewell, high as Heaven, eyes low as Hell
Keep scratching, keep biting my nails
Keep lighting a L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seeing crooked
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy

Musty herb in a Ziploc, twistin' up top notch
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryna see what I toke
This that Cali Kush, I motivate not gloat
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the Ghost
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up every morning and I take a drag
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean, then I laugh
In your baby mama ear, and I'm gonna smash
They call me the trippy king, don't try me nigga

These niggas listening, use Morse code
Boy, nigga sipping like parched throat
Ahe-he-hem, excuse me?
These niggas talking that beef shit
We'll check into it like the room's cheap
And all we sell is the greatest feeling on Earth
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork
Ain't got nothing left to prove, unless I got to prove it in court
Live fast, die young, and leave a beautiful corpse, yes, Lord
My nigga order like twenty bricks
I sent five bricks with four chicks
Riding with these guns, that's carpooling
Bought extra clips when I dove in
Miss Snow White, we snowed in
Nigga, miss me with that ho shit
Kill all rats, I toast to that
And watch everybody I toast wit
Kill everybody you close with
Just don’t stick your nose in my bullshit
Cause I close it like a clothespin
The people that I rolls with
Will leave holes in what you drove in
If anyone in that car live
You tell that nigga I owe him, yeah
I got my mind right, my money right
My head on my shoulder
And my eyesight a little blurry, but
It's staying on my quota
And we find out Mom's address
And your head get mailed over

Or get that bitch made over

I’ll tell you something I do know
Like money, drugs, bitches, guns
Niggas call me ""Mucho""
Got witches all in my broom closet
Got little killers in JuCo
We’ll find out your business hours
And pop up like new toast
Like, danger taste like glucose
My shadow don’t get too close
To that new nigga with my old hoes: kudos
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno
Getting swole like Popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno
I’m in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points
AK to your face; knock half off, like coupons
Too cool for school, but I sold cool points to schoolboys
Tell the cops, We don’t name drop, that's like droppin newborns
Nigga you crazy
[Interlude]
You so crazy, Tunechi
These hoes made me

[Verse 3]
Nigga tell me somethin I don't know
Like where the fuck did my heart go?
And show me somethin I haven’t seen
And give me what helped Martin sleep
On the same night he had a dream
And take me to where I’ve never been
But not to where I never be in
I ain’t never scared, but I’m scared of me
Me vs. Me, I need a referee
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy
Fuck deputy, big letter B
Need equity, need credit cleaned
To trafficking from peddling like everything
From amphetamines to medicine
These niggas sweeter than nectarine and Grenadine, ha!

Tell me somethin I don’t know
Like what happened to hard coke?
You can call me Eddie cause I stay ready
My family call me Eduardo
I’m music to these bitches ears
I hit that ass like the wrong note
My bitch bad, with corn rows
With boots on in farm clothes
You can find me prancin in the finest mansion
With the finest dancer with a height advantage
She want cocaine, pills, and weed, liquor and dick
She gotta micro manage
I'm just eatin rappers
They go nice in salads
With some diced up carrots
I just like a challenge
Psychopathic, so psychopathic

Uhh, I woke up this morning, dick rock hard
Ashed my blunt in my Grammy Award
You can save your bullshit on your memory card
If this real nigga business, then you niggas unemployed
Jumped on the celly, called Makaveli

Looked in the mirror, said ""You's an ill nigga""
Then I ran to the money like track and field nigga
Now I think I'll have me a coffee with six sugars
In a world full of ass-kissers and dick pullers
I'm tryna walk a straight line but the line crooked
I'm shooting for the stars, astronauts dodge bullets

And when life sucks, I just enjoy the head
I'm so sick of these niggas, I need meds
Uh, smoking on that hallelujah, thank you Jesus
Help me focus on the future and not the previous
Double R, I'm a rebel with a reason
Sometimes you gotta fight the devil with a demon
Blood is in the streets and it is up to my knees
Underground shit, I see myself as a seed
Living in the glass, and everybody's looking
But how can you get the picture if you don't know who took it?
This current affairs, but who the hell cares?
Everybody's fighting over positions, musical chairs
On the road to redemption, you gonna use a few spares

You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring

And if I would cry, then you would cry twice
To me, you are the brightest star under sunlight
See, take away my title, take away my stripes
You give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
Give me back my girl, and you give me back my life
See, this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice
Open up my eyes hopin' she be in my sight
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back

But I wish you and yours nothin' but happiness, shawty

But I hope you haven't forgot about me—
Up in the living room, watchin' SportsCenter
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner
But the Lord is a forgiver; you know, they say if you pray
Then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered
And your boyfriend is not like me
Ma, you even went and got a teardrop like me
I remember we would sit at home all day
You called me ""butter,"" I called you ""babe""
My momma asked about you, my partners did too
I know your daughter will be so amazing like you
And I know you probably wish you never met me
And I just wish you never forget me, and let me say:
Please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with
No engagement can amount to your friendship
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen
And all I can do is dream, damn!

Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money tall, Lisa Leslie
YMCMB connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Woman up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fucking, she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist, I'll bust in ya face
I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away
[Chorus]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

[Interlude]
Weezy (Yeah) Where ya going? (Up)
You're going a little bit too far (Haha)

[Verse 2]
Ain't this a bitch
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill your ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even fix your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon' be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
So I guess you can say I'm coming home
You're wyling out then we're riding out
Now your hiding out, honeycomb
I'm laughing to the bank
Like I just broke my fucking funny bone
What's really good five?
I'm over here smoking that really good fire
Eyes so low I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook fine
I be with niggas that took lives
And niggas that'll take it outside
And niggas that'll take it to your crib
Take the baby out the crib and rape the housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted
They gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit
These rappers are just my hostages
Let's cut to the chase, my bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away
[Chorus]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I come down in a couple of days

You're going a little bit too far (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away (Up up and away)
Up up and away

[Verse 3]
Fuck with a nigga, if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps on deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you looking like lightning struck that nigga
Racks on deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm calling my bitch the shit
Walking around on my fuck it shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm Superbad
I don't give a Hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggas
They should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter, vote for Lil Wayne
Sit your five dollar ass down 'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes, I'm jumping the gates
And I ain't got nothing to say, but up up and away
[Interlude]
Weezy, where you going?
You're going a little bit too far
(Up up and away)

[Outro]
Up up and away (Up up and away)

Yeah...  Sick shit
I been walkin' on this water, bone dry, hard times
R.I.P. baby, my phone died, but don't cry
Heaven's gates was closed, I went to Hell, there was a long line
Two hoes in the bed, it's hard to wake up on the wrong side

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Few bumps in the road, a little bump and grind I don't mind
Please know, for your fuckin' piggy bank you could get hog tied
Two Ninas on me, you fuck with me, them girls goin' wild
Guilty conscience pimpin', make my ho sit through the whole trial
I been walkin' on this fuckin' water for a long time
Molly water got me transformin' like I'm Voltron
Smokin' so much weed, I might just fuck around and hug a tree
A tree without a bird 'cause I deserve every fuckin' leaf

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
1, 2, 3; triple-OG
At the T-O-P smokin' P-O-T
From a D-O-G to the G-O-D
Got OCD and not your CD
Hit her with the D-O-P-E D
That's Dope Dick Tunechi, DDT
You could D-I-E for a F-E-E
I'll D-I-E for my S-E-T
I told my son that ""Whatever the sun touch is yours, little nigga""
I told my daughter, ""Don't give up your love to a poor little nigga""
I told my bitch if she cheat then she making a poor decision
I told that bitch if she leave then she leavin' the solar system
But hoes don't listen
But I'm on the road to riches, and she can't ignore the engine
I bought myself a medallion that cost an Azure, my nigga
I don't know, guess I was bored, my nigga
Tell foreign hoes ""I'm El Señor"", my nigga
To the Moon like Warren, nigga
He ain't the plug unless he foreign, nigga
It ain't a car unless it's foreign, nigga
And a R plus another R, my nigga
But I used to want a Ford Explorer, nigga
Had to move the trap house to Florida, nigga
Had to move The Carter by the water, nigga
But I'm still too scared to get in the water, nigga
'Bout to throw another pool party, nigga
I told a op that wherever this gun point is holes, lil nigga
Stayin' on my feet, no tappin' on my toes, like Moses, nigga
I told the cops that my car is too fast to pull over, nigga
Cool as fuck, keepin' my cool before my composure, nigga
That's poker, nigga
Playin' the cards I was dealt, and that shit almost broke a nigga
But I could be broker, nigga
But I’m watching Oprah, nigga
In my white house layin' on my sofa, keepin' it soulful, nigga
I'm a young mogul, nigga
I'm a young Hova, nigga
My office is oval, nigga
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I step out that bitch like, ""What's happenin'?""
Me and that little bitch I was nappin' in
Time to run with no rubber, I'm gamblin'
Just call me the rapper, I'm Chancin' it
Got a sassy bitch, told her ""I'm daddy, bitch""
Do it look like I'm playin'? Kaepernick
Niggas don't know a star from an asterisk
This that new coffin, new casket shit
My killers killin' on purpose by accident
And you passed that shit like a laxative
Ain't where or why you trap, it's who you trappin' with
For me it's about who I travel with
Never about the bitch that I be snappin' on
It's the one that the picture just snapped me with
That's 'cause I'm the shit, and all of my shit be maggot less

So ride to it, y'all, vibe to it, y'all, damn

Goddamn, Mix done hit a nigga in his head with this one
I'ma paint the city red with this one
I'm ahead with this one
See, you fucking with the boy who tote toys way before Christmas
No assistance just that persistence with that commitment if
I don't get it, somebody gon' die tonight
I know my vibe is tight and I deserve the throne
And if the kid ain't right, then let me die in this song
See, I be ridin', just ridin' alone
With my daddy on my mind like, ""You gotta be kidding""
How the hell you ain't here to see your prince do his thing?
Sometimes I wanna drop a tear, but no emotions from a king
Shall be, so I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'
So I be who I be, that's me
That's Weezy F Baby, and please say the motherfuckin'

My head to the sky, my feet on the ground
My fingers to the judge, if the money don't move
Then I won't budge, won't budge
No, I won't budge, no, Lord

[Verse 2]
Money is the motivation, facing the avenue
Back touching the wall, got the weed, got the gun
Gotta run when I hear the bird call (Brr), damn (Brr)
Hop in that thing and murk off, swerve off
You know me, they call me Birdman Junior (Ah-ah)
Anybody murderer if Birdman sponsor it (For sure, nigga, get you, you heard?)
Phantom of the Opera, all black, guap tint, locked in
I can let them shots out, you can't get no shots in
Bulletproof, leave a nigga with a bullet-roof
Shoot ya in your mouth, Leroy, they call him bullet-tooth
I'm like, ""What it do? What it do?""
There's a full court pressure, I'm just goin' for the two
If I'm open for the three, I'ma take it in a second
Even if there's one second, I'ma make it, it's nothin'
I don't take it for granted, I don't take it for nothin'
I take it for what it's worth to the dirt, motherfucker, yeah

And I promise if you try me, he gon' have to rewind this track
And make me go back, that thing'll go rrat
That boy'll lay flat, so flat
That act is what I perform amongst you haters
Got nina in my palm and I'm masturbating

Got me feeling like Scarface, light the Cohiba

You know I be out here right in a four-seater
Top floor of the Four Seasons
Four of them whores
And they all know how to cook it up
And look I got some
And only one know how to bag, bitch, bundle up
See, it's a cold world, so homie, bundle up
We ain't on this grind for nothin', now get your hustle up

Just want some mouth and lip service
And I got all my niggas in that truck like an Excursion

Okay I'm straight at you, no ricochet
That pussy boneless, that's Chick-fil-a
I fuck with real riders and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents, we will start digging graves
I swear my momma trust my work
So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get murked
And my pants sagging like fuck it - I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was making bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Mane my niggas got them birds, you ain't even got bird seeds
Your bitch ride me like a go kart, I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they worthless

I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
And her birthday suit is her pajamas

I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever cosign him

And I'm bringin' home the bacon, it's fryin' on the stove
You hoes can't drive me crazy, keep your eyes on the road
Got the money on my mind, and bodies on my nine
And I swear every day, I'm on my Ariana grind-de
I got that yay, I got that la-di-da-di-da
And a kamikaze squad, and you chicken parmesan
Lord, I'm a free man like I come from Amistad

I get money while I'm 'sleep, I dream that I'm in Heaven
I dream I saw Lil Beezy and smoked a 'gar with Wessy
All my niggas, rest in peace, and my enemy, rest pleasant
So when my niggas creep, they catch him when he least expect 'em
Mama told me ""If you run these streets, run these streets correctly""
Well, feet don't fail me now; I never knew my feet to test me
Lord knows I wear new clothes to the mall
Two hoes on my arm
Fur boots when it's warm
Church shoes to play ball
I'm spittin' this shit like bird food to a dog

Holy moly, hockey mask like Halloween like OVO

All they sell is pussy 'cause they been sold they soul
Boy, you go zero to sixty, I go one-and-two-zeros
Pedal to the metal, I call it rose gold
Lord, all I know is paper, big fat money rolls
Look at how big my safe is, that bitch got double doors
I was runnin' outta patience 'til I heard ""All aboard""
They mad 'cause I be skatin' at home on marble floors
Lord knows I drive fast in my driveway
I pop tags and throw 'em down and make the ground shake
Goddamn, a pint of lean almost 5K
I be spendin' 25K every 5 days

Puttin' it to my chest and missin' my heart by centimeters

And I'm sittin' here reading what was written 'bout what I do, what I didn't

'Cause most people are nobody 'til somebody kill 'em

Wishin' I was in your shoes, I'd take them off and find a beach
And superstars don't sparkle, we high-beam
And you can't spell fame, without me
And may my Hall of Fame speech be short and sweet

Never question myself, unless I ask, ""Am I dreamin'?""

Car wash to the cleaners, Walmart to Neiman's
They told me time would tell

Ayy, the blues is now kickin', and dinner is three Michelin
I don't eat red meat, but still got beef sizzlin'
Know that I need discipline
I keep singin' for all these hoes, they keep listenin'
Niggas love to bro up with the boy and dap fists-es
But we are not equivalent, dawg
I been an only child, don't need siblings
And I'm past them like the times that he's livin' in, okay
Man, if you saw what I flew here, you'd be like, ""He's sickenin'""
If you not runnin' some top, we not gon' keep kickin' it
Classics, I keep scribblin', lights in the Universal building just keep flickerin'
Money just keep comin' in, you would think I'm Irish the way that it stays doublin'
I could feed a country with the tax that I pay governments
Whatеver they're doin' with my cash is vеry troublin'
Okay, February came around, I used to get paid shovelin'
Sold clothes, walked dogs, trust me, I stay hustlin'
When it came to school, there's no way that I'm A-plus-in' it
So I just dropped out of it, trust me, I'm not proud of it
Niggas get too comfy in they spot, they get knocked out of it
Niggas get a gun just so they can make props out of it
Shawty make a scene in the house, she get locked out of it
Yeah, you not 'bout to be chillin' in this bitch with kicked feet up
I'ma make you bounce out this ho like Big Freedia
Pete O. used to throw a purple tint on a two-liter
First private plane I ever rode was a eight-seater
Before that, I got the bedroom hot with a space heater
On top of that, I didn't have shit to my name either, that's real
But now I'm givin' house tours 'til it's back to world tours
Play that ""Mask Off"" when they find the real cure
I might not be good for her, but I'm real to her
Got no time for her, but give Richard Mille to her
That's the only way I know how to express love
My dawgs love sticks and drums like they Questlove
All them jokes about Aubrey, they got me messed up, for real
I come with a lot of complications inside me
It's always people misleadin' me that are tryna guide me
Everyone wants to try me, but no one wants to buy me
Everyone wants to meet me, but no one wants to keep me
Everyone talkin' lemons when everything is peachy
Everyone got they hands out, and it ain't to reach me
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Mhm, yeah, mhm
Everyone got they glass out, let's drink to Weezy
Every nigga that stare me down just came to see me
Choppin' up a lil' cash cow, that's steak I'm eatin'
Check deposits, high-risers with extra closets
The sex platonic, I talk intelligent, text Ebonics
The electronic guitars whinin', that's just Nirvana
Tommy gun on the counter, I call it Mr. Thomas
That'll keep niggas honest
I'm dozin' off in the driver seat 'cause the seat give massages
Decimal point money, these numbers too steep for commas
I'm eye to eye with niggas, I can't help but to see beyond 'em
Got a two-seater problem
Niggas thinkin' they cold, I knock the flu-season out 'em
Bitches forget they hoes, and that's when Tunechi remind 'em
I used to fuck Gucci models, I'm fuckin' Gucci designers
I keep it too G regardless, I'm gettin' too deep for divers
Let me resurface, I'm flexin' on purpose
She especially curvy, bet she be servin' every purpose, perfect
I'm better than perfect, I'm sick, I need to see a medical person
Eatin' all of these rappers with these edible verses
All I gotta be is all that I can possibly
She really, really into me, then suck it all up out of me
I'm proud of me, I don't know how to be sorry, apologies
You fuckin' with my math, you better know some trigonometry
'Cause I'ma be bustin', leave your lima bean at your mama feet
I flip the economy like Dominique Dawes
They say I'm trippin', I guess they wishin' I finally fall
I don't need war, I need a bitch that know I'ma need yours
I'ma need more, niggas is shifty like Honda Accords
Fire alarm, ain't got no ceilings, we climbin' the walls
Higher than yours, I fuck your bitch and she die in my arms
Lion has roared, No Ceilings 3 with my mind on the fourth
Holla at your boy7Embed"

Uh, boy shorts, wife beater
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer
She was sleeping on me, but she's a light sleeper
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader
I talk shit, I hope it matters
We climax, without the ladder
Can't desert the future, no Nevada
Her body is a weapon, ratatat her
I spent the night in heaven, I slept with an angel
And when we finish, I swear that pussy said thank you
I said, ""You're Very Welcome"" I'm so well mannered
And I go down south, Louisiana

[Chorus: John Legend]
Baby won't you spend the night
Darling I don't want to wake up, and you are not by my side
(So special, so special,so special, so special)
And if you promise me tonight, Yeah
Baby that you'll let me in, then I'mma make you feel so special girl
(So special, so special,so special, so special)

Then we take a shower together, and wash each others back
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back
And then she say my name, like I forgot it
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze
Yeah, body language, girl let's talk about it
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast
Open her up like a book, read it and weep

Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya
I, put it together, common denominator
I tear it up like loose leaf paper
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge
I knock her lights out, I blow her fuse
See we don't even fuck no more, we make love
And now shes on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds
Cause she my honey bee, yeah, buzz buzz
And now I'm itching and scratching, that's that love bug

I'm so high I feel weightless
All my shooters are courageous, and

Ain't a moment 'til I make it
It ain't a moment 'til I make it

And see lately
All I've been doin' is celebratin'
Don't even know what I'm celebratin'
I know why you ain't celebratin', cause you ain't sellin' nathin'
They got niggas catchin' cases, while we out here catchin' breaks
And I'm gon' shoot it if I wave it, shoot it if I wave it
(Shoot it if I wave it)
Do yourself a favor, save yourself cause I can't save yah

[Verse 1]
Know you see me in that Rolls Royce, glass house, that nigga, hands down
No givin' up, no layin' down, all red, ant pile
My oldest son just turned five, I said ""Lil nigga, you a man now""
Ride around with that strap out cause my Rolls Royce, glass house
I just got a text that said ""Baby I just cashed out""
Whack weed get ashed out, put Persian rugs in the crack house
All y'all that lashed out, I'll come see what that's 'bout
But you don't need to call the fireman, to put a mothafuckin' match out
I can't remember my last drought, all my niggas' smashmouth
Got pure coke, brand new birds, we get 'em as soon as they hatch, slime
And you know the driveway too big when you ain't gotta back out
Paper chase like cat mouse, my nigga it

Know you see me cause my roof all in my trunk
Know he dead when the horn honk
Niggas say they kings, they lyin', boy you talkin' to a card shark
I already made my mark, please don't think I just pop corks
Got these voices in my head screamin', can't believe they're not hoarse
Bitch I've been a beast since cartoon sheets
It's real on the field, I need new cleats, outgrew these
Catch you while you sleep, turn your sheets to maroon sheets
Them choppers turn your homeboys into amputees
And that's not a good look, momma was a chef, but daddy cooked the work
Said ""I know it stank but it's good""
Look, we treat them triggers like repeat buttons
Leave it all out there, or leave nothin'
Like the world a crystal ball, I keep rubbin' it

I feel like, feel like I'm on my final caper
Uh, and I'm about to smoke one, pass out, OG kush, hashed out
She only want alcohol and trees, fuck that, you gotta branch out
I camp out by a rat house, wait 'till he turn the lamp out
Still drownin' in the fuckin' money, y'all niggas look like y'all swam out
In this bitch, gats out in this bitch
She say she can come and help my fat wallet get fit

I used to fuck and get tired, now I fuck her ten times
She used to make me dick rise, now she make me ribeyes
She used to make me six-nine, now she make her friend try
She used to make me love her, now she make me realize
It's money over bitches 'till the day I dizz-ie
Keep it on the East Side, keep it on the B-side
I feel like Ivan Drago, if he dies, he dies

Find out where he reside and find out where he hide
Run up in that bitch like, ""Hey,"" pop-pop-pop, peace sign
Percocet, promethazine, you can call me P-Rod
Taking shots at my team, you must be getting senile
You goin' at my slime then you're going at me, slime
Your blood all over the scene, it look like red cheap wine
I'm smoking on a key lime, you look like tea time
Look like honey to my beehive, I close your sweet eyes
Shoot ya in ya head, give ya ass three eyes
And you still ain't seen a fucking thing until you C5
I remember you, I was never into you
I tell my shooters, shoot you and whoever resemble you
And every member who had been a friend of you or kin to you
They in it too, and bitches too, they mention you, they dentures loose
Run up in a nigga house, pistol in that nigga mouth
Safe code now nigga, cough it up or spit it out

With my bros will smoke you niggas, like we grow you niggas
Kill your ho too nigga, and your go-to niggas
I've been riding 'round the city with the safety off
Glock nine and it's pretty like a baby doll
You niggas bitches and it's pissing all the ladies off
My finger sitting on the trigger like a La-Z-Boy
If there was beef, I'm in the kitchen with the apron on
Put his words on the plate, that nigga ate 'em all
And I ain't wit' the talking, but damn now he talking
Nigga spilled the beans, damn, now it's coffee
Looking for your pussy ass like I got a warrant
I throw on the ski mask, that's a private party
Bullets jumping off your ass like they shock absorbant
Rock your bells, LL, nigga locked and loaded

Un-fucking-believable! Lil Wayne's the president
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, even if they celibate
I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been
I'm married to that crazy bitch; call me Kevin Federline
It's obvious that he'll be Cash Money 'til the death of him
The ground shall break when they bury him—bury him?
I know one day they got to bury him
Better lock my casket tight, baby, so I don't let the Devil in
People, it's just me and my guitar
Yeah, bitch, I'm heavy metallin'
You can get the fuckin' Led Zeppelin

And we hold court and take your life for a settlement
Yes, I am the best—and no, I ain't positive, I'm definite

Tied to the fuckin' Birdman like a lug
And dear Mr. Ronald Williams
To you I shall forever give thanks like a pilgrim

That's when I can't hold my shit within, so I shit on myself
‘Cause I'm so sick and tired of shittin' on everybody else

Ha...
Take it, FATBOI
No Ceilings
Ugh

[Verse]
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
President, got 'em in the White House naked
Looked at the clock and it say, ""Right now""
Get a pound, break it down, blow it like trial
Panatela Dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Young Money, baby, big shit, like a horse ass
Stacks in my backpack, shades on, hat back
Bugatti, matte black—""Where they do that at?""
South Beach Miami, ho, I'm probably with Tammy To'
My life is a video and the women want they cameo
I just want them pantyhose, and I’m higher than Ger-an-imo
And I got them tools, tell them boys it could get mechanical
Now, pop that pussy like a four-four
I turn you 'round and bend you over like a low blow
It’s Young Money, baby, we the fucking greatest
We done put them other niggas on a hiatus
Beat your bitch with the pump if she deny data
'Cause I’ll serve anyone like a blind waiter
I make my girl cum first; then, I arrive later
I shake you pussies up, I'm a vibrator, haha!
G—Getting money like, ""Hell yeah""
This shit so good, it don’t even smell bad
And you can tell Dad that I’m a motherfucker
You niggas bet' not slip—Ice Road Truckers
Light-pole barrel, chopper stupid-long
New Orleans nigga, I get super-dome
Loyal to the game, the game been good to me
Still spitting fire, you niggas wood to me, ha!
We on, nigga; let—let them hoes know
Young Money lay 'em down like old folks
You coming with it? We coming for it
Plenty to go around—now, watch the money orbit
Real shit, people; now, just absorb it
I tried to pay attention, but y'all mad boring
And I got so much swag, I need an ad for it
And I don’t like to brag, so my bitches brag for me
Oh, she a good girl? I got her transforming
She give me hot head, I call it ""global warming""
If we gon' do it, dog, let's do it now
I—I—I am more animal than the zoo allow
Put me in the wild, I’ll be there for a while
You niggas Little League, call 'em Curaçao
Energizer money: it keep going
I’m laid up, I’m free-throwing
Who rebounding? Who gives a shit?
Fuck that, I got 27 years of this
Hit or miss, I hit your missus
You are local news; I’m 60 Minutes
I—I hit the target, I hit the witness
I work out in my office—guess I’m fit for business
Too many visions, completed missions
Still icing out crosses—keep it Christian
We consistent, the streets commend it
Weezy F. Baby, the ""F"" is for ""Forensics""
From start to finish, Usain Wayne
OK, you doing your thing? Well, things change
You plain-Jane, I’m diverse
I save the world second, and I get high first
I’m a mind freak, check my time sheet
Bitch, I bring the noise where the lions sleep
Your flow never wet, like Grandma pussy
I’m always good, like Grandma cookies
Yeah, call me the spleen or the spine fixer
It's going down like the Catalina Wine Mixer
She going down like the hands on my time-ticker
I’m always strapped—Vietnam, nigga
We are fine, nigga, like Amber Rose
We ball, nigga, like Jalen Rose
Better tell them hoes, I got a million flows
Label me the hardest nigga in civilian clothes
Young Money, baby, and the building grows
As we look up—where did the ceilings go?

Skinny ass pants, fresh pair of Vans
If them niggas keep tripping they can share an ambulance
Throw up blood with my hands
My gang popping niggas
Smoke that Kiesha, not that Reggie
For you name dropping niggas
All day I do it, I do it like Tony
Got a sign on my dick that say ""Bad Bitches Only""
I don't drink champagne, it make my stomach hurt
Man I'm on that Patron, fuck with me wrong and get murked
Got a silencer on the gun, that bitch go pew
Got a mean ass swagger, my bitches do too
Yeah all my niggas nuts and I'm a loose screw
Bitch I get big bucks, pockets on Bruce Bruce
Yeah I talk that shit, bitch I got bread, bitch I got toast
Welcome to The Murder Show — I am the motherfucking host
They call me Weezy F. Baby, yes I do the fucking most
I'm at their throats until they choke
The God has spoke
I need a smoke break
(Smoke break…)

[Chorus 1]
Now let it breathe, Tune
It go; all these bitches, and niggas still hating
I used to be balling, but now I'm Bill Gating

Got a list full of problems
I'll tend to them later
Yeah, life is a bitch, but I appreciate her, man

It go; dark-ass shades, I can't see them haters
Now eat these fucking bullets, don't forget to tip the waiter
Dress like a skater, ride on you like Shaun White
I'm high all day, you can call that shit a long flight
Every night's a long night, every day's a holiday
I don't fuck with squares, now do that mean I'm out of shape?
Yes I talk shit, got to defecate to conversate
Weezy fuck the world, yep I fuck it 'til it ovulate
Get her to the crib, get in that pussy and just dominate
Weezy F. Baby and the 'F' is for fornicate
Polo Ralph Lauren, bitch, that's what my pajamas say
Big tall glass of some shit you can't pronounciate
Boogers in the bezel of my watch with the vomit face
And still I do not give you motherfuckers the time of day
Pistol in your mouth, I can not make out what you trying to say
And if they want a war
Then tell them motherfuckers ""Bombs away""

[Chorus 2]
Man, all these bitches, and niggas still hating

Got a list full of problems — I'll tend to 'em later

Kush in the Swisher, money over bitches
Never kill a woman, unless she a witness
All about my business, survival of the fittest
She let me hide my weed in her titties
Bitch, I got the cash, in a rubberband
I got the Glock, already cocked, boom!
Fucking with a nigga, meet my motherfucking goons
Sorry 4 the Wait, Carter IV coming soon
Light it up, cause I’ma smoker
She tried to deepthroat, I fucked around and choked her
It’s Young Money, motherfucker, game over
Shots leave your body, looking like you doing yoga
And Lord knows I'm a sinner, pain pills for dinner
Bitch, I'm getting money like I got a money printer
Got a chopper and a trimmer, shooting like Jimmer
You coming in that water, boy, you better be a swimmer
I ain't worrying bout y’all, sitting on my Hog
While Miss Anita Baker sing ""You Bringing Me Joy""
I came straight outta jail and did my thing on these boys
And we all yelled, “Fuck you, bitch!” and kept going
I'm on, and that’s right, baby
I ain't going out this bitch without a fight, baby
One request: please don’t bite, baby
I got some bomb-ass pussy from a white lady
I ain't lying, I’ma shine like a nickel or a diamond
I smoke a lot of weed to keep them bitches off of my mind
Girl, stop talking that shit
Go'n suck a nigga dick for a new outfit, hahaha
And even if the sky come falling
Bitch, I’ma still be high
I got faith in my weed man

Baby, you understand me now
If, sometimes, you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad

But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ugh, what’s understood ain’t got to be explained
But you don't understand me, so let me explain
Heh, stood in the heat, the flame
The snow, ""Please, slow down, hurricane""
The wind blow, my dreads swang
""He had hair like wool, like Wayne""
Huh, dropping ashes in the Bible
I shake 'em out, and they fall on the rifle
Scary, Hail Mary, no tale-fairy
All real, very extraordinary
Perry Mason, facing the barrel if he tattle
My God is my judge; no gown, no gavel
A hound, a rebel, down to battle
Now or never, or whenever, and the F for...
""Fucking fantastic""—fuck if you agree

So for those who understand, meet Dwayne
For eight and a half months, I gave Miss Cita pain
Now it's Young Money, baby—keep the change
My mama say, ""Fuck 'em!"" And we the same
So hello, motherfucker—you got some sheets to change
And ain't it funny how people change like Easter Sunday?
You know: church fit, then outfit
Bright pink and green chest look house-lit
Bright pinky rings, but that ain't about this—
What you 'bout, bitch?
Excuse my French emotion and my passion
But I wear my heart on my sleeve like it's the new fashion
What are you asking? If I don't have the answer—
It's probably on the web, like I'm a damn tarantula
But I know you don't understand
'Cause you thought Lil Wayne was Weezy, but Weezy is Wayne

[Chorus: Nina Simone]
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
[Spoken: Lil Wayne]

I'm watchin' TV the other day, right? Got this white guy on there talking 'bout Black guys. Talking about how young Black guys are targeted. Targeted by who? America.
You see, one in every one hundred Americans are locked up. One in every nine Black Americans are locked up. And see, what the white guy was trying to stress was that the money that we spend on sending a motherfucker to jail, a young motherfucker to jail, would be less to send his or her young ass to college.
See, and another thing the white guy was stressing was that our jails are populated with drug dealers. You know, crack cocaine? Yeah, stuff like that. Meaning, due to the laws we have on crack cocaine and regular cocaine, the police are... only... I don't want to say only right, but, shit... only logic by riding around in the hood all day, and not in the suburbs, because crack cocaine is mostly found in the hood. And um, you know, the other thing is mostly found—you know where I'm going... But why bring a motherfucker to jail if it's not gonna stand up in court? Because this drug ain't that drug. You know; Level 3, Level 4 drugs, shit like that.

Mhm... I guess it's all a misunderstanding. And um, I sit back and think, well shit, us young motherfuckers, you know, that one in every nine: We probably only selling the crack cocaine just because we in the hood, and it's not like your suburbs. We don't have the things that you have. Why? I really don't want to know the answer. But, I guess we just misunderstood, huh? Yeah.

You know, we don't have room in the jail now for the real motherfuckers, the real criminals, you know: sex offenders, rapists, serial killers, shit like that. Oh, don't get scared, don't get scared. I know you saw one of them sex offender papers! Don't trip, he live right on the end of your block, mhm. Yeah, that nigga live right down the street from you. Sex offender, on the Level 3 drug. Convicted, ex-con, yeah, check him out.

And what you got, you got daughters, son, what you got? Yeah, well you know what? (coughing) Don't stop the track. That's the good weed.

You know what? I have a fucking daughter. You understand me? And why the fuck would you bring my neighbor to jail just because the reason why he live next door to me ain't the reason why I live next door to him? Meaning, he didn't rap his way to my fuckin' neighborhood. He sold crack cocaine to get to my neighborhood. You move him out, bring him to jail for life, and then, you move in a sex offender. Hahaha. Then give me a paper. Haha. Is that a misunderstanding? 'Cause I don't understand it.

Another thing. Let me take my glasses off, 'cause I want to see the reaction on the faces when I say this. Uhh... Mr. Al Sharpton: here's why I don't respect you, and nobody like you.
Mhm, see, you're the type that gets off on gettin' on other people, haha. That's not good, no homo, and rather un-human, I should say. I mean, given the fact that humanity, well, good humanity, rather, to me, is helping one another, no matter your color or race. But this guy, and people like him, they'd rather speculate before they informate, if that's a word, haha. You know, ""'spec before check,"" anyway. Meanin', I'd much rather you talk to me first and see if you can learn an opinion before you make one. Just my thought of good humanity, Mr. Sharpton, haha.

Hold on, I ain't finished wit' you man. Gotta pluck the ashes, mhm, hold on, um...

Mr. Sharpton, and anyone like you: You don't know me. So, if you're not gonna try to, then what you say or think about me, or whatever I do, is totally Casper the Friendly Ghost to me. And, it doesn't make you a good person to criticize before you improvise. Doesn't necessarily make you a bad person neither, but the characteristics fall heavily into bad's way, haha!

But, since I am human, I am good and bad as well. But I try my hardest to stay good. And some of the things I do and say may be bad, or just not too good. But I do try. So with that said, I don't fault you. I mean, you're only human. Good or bad. but I also don't respect you, and I don't care if that's good or bad, haha.
You see, you are no MLK, you are no Jesse Jackson. You are nobody, to me. You're just another Don King... with a perm. Just a little more political. And that just means you're a little un-human than us humans. And now, let me be human, by saying fuck Al Sharpton, and anyone like him.

Fuck if you understand me. I love being misunderstood. Haha, why? 'Cause I live in the suburbs, but I come from the hood. Bring the hook in!

I stand in front of the clock, 'cause I'm ahead of the time
Knock your pussy ass off and send your head to your mom

And the coupe transform, no Tyrese
Hello, goodbye, where are you, Wayne?
I’m somewhere in between joy and pain
And I reach for the stars, got stuck in the clouds
Got high as a bitch and left my love on the ground
Now, ain’t that 'bout a bitch? It ain’t never 'bout a bitch
I'll take your bitch and make her everybody bitch

And I just bought your girlfriend some kneepads, nigga

Sleep with the hammer under the pillow
Get into the room, bend her over like her elbows
Soon as I’m done, peel off like velcro
Gone, baby, I'm stoned
Smokin' on the strong, got a huge-ass bong
Swag off the hook, you can’t use that phone
Stopped at the light and put my roof back on

The niggas got it locked, the niggas with the keys
The niggas on the block, the niggas on they P’s and Q’s

But real niggas don't whine, we'll burn down your vineyard
I been balling since cornrows, still ducking the narcos
My little niggas in war mode, you spark it up, we charcoal
Got a bad bitch with long hair that have bad days when the mall closed
I'm a big dog, big doghouse, make ashtrays out of dog bowls, yeah
Blessings on top of sins, resting with topless twins
Picture me broke but forgot to take the top off the lens
In the restaurant, I’m with Slim, wrestling with lobster limbs

And I got more bounce, to the 28 grams

She check my phone, what's that 'bout?
Any other ho I would've cursed her ass out
But that's romance, that's romance, that's romance, that's romance
She kiss my ankle when I twisted my ankle
She even did anal when she don't do anal

Throw a party every day, nigga

[Verse]
Tunechi, bitch
On my Future shit
I'm too legit
I sleep on a crucifix
I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic
Then shoot my bitch
Behind orange juice and grits
Uzi clip
I need another Uzi clip
I shoot to kill
These pussy niggas shooting bricks
I'm too for real
Your head just a souvenir
She wanna get it off her chest
But her boobs too big
I'm bumping Carter 5
On a iPod
My bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet
She said ""Soon as these niggas hear your new shit
They gon' have to give they styles back""
I said ""You too cray""
She said ""You too humble""
I said ""You too, bae""
She said ""You too sweet""
Then I ask her do she go both ways
She say ""They do say love is a two-way street""
I say ""Oooh""
Talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me
Treat that girl like cuisine
She gon' wanna shoot scenes
Put my dick in museum
I'm gon' die on my feet
Never knees in the dirt
Never dirt on my knees
I'm just serving these fiends
Sell birds to the bees
I sell birds to the trees
""Tune, I heard you don't sleep""
I'm allergic to dreams
I don't twerk, but I tweak
For that purple, that pink
Yeah you see what I'm saying
Like you heard what you see
I'm a verbal disease
I'm allergic to me
Been a turd on these streets
Since my curtains was sheets
Chef on these beats
I'm just stirring the grease
That bitch you in love with
She working for me
I personally
Get you murdered this week
Like that blunt between my two fingers
I'm at peace
Word
I smirk when I squeeze
Trigger smart, street smart
I'm a nerd, I'm a geek
I'm absurd, I'm unique
Did my time at Cash Money
Time served and released
But this agent ain't free
Word
That's the word on these streets
But that shit is old news
That shit's so yesterweek
I'm just focused
Focused on my expertise
They like ""Tunechi, you good?""
I'm like ""Bob, yessiree!""
Now don't, I mean don't
Don't question me
Let me breathe
Dog, big dog
I cock back and shoot at ya fleas
Money long – Tree trunk
Now stand under me
Catch these leaves
I guarantee no guarantees
But repeat what you heard
You a dead parakeet
It's Tunechi, bitch
Your bitch Tunechi's bitch
I fuck her on my balcony
We watch the moon eclipse
We do unusual shit
She gonna need lube for this
'Cause I'mma stick it in her maximus gluteus
We at the top of the world
She like the view and shit
From up here everybody look the puniest
The coke got her all exuberant
She doing lines like a movie script
But these are true events
Lord
I'll kill a nigga right now
I'll put a nigga lights out
Then put his body in a ice box
With holes in his body like socks
These niggas softer than
These niggas softer than nylon
So keep my name out your mouth
I hope it taste like cayenne
Looking up at the skyline
I'm thinking to my fuckin' self
""You only live twice, slime""
And motherfuck you if you fight crime
I'm from a place with a high crime rate, like Iran
We put your ass on Nightline
I'm on the grass like a python
These niggas looking at me
These niggas looking at me sideways
That's because they on the sideline
But they never tried mine
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide
While my bitch sip a Mai Tai
But she wine fine
And I'm so sorry
She say ""Don't be sorry""
Woo
Then she say ""Don't apologize for shit
'Cause you the shit
And we know Tha Carter 5 the shit""
Woah

[Intro/Piano Solo]
*lighter flick*
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
I'm in the crib butt-naked, bitch
She say my dick could be the next Black president
Americans hate that I'm American
Medicine, I treat it like peppermints
Ugh, I'm in the ocean getting shark pussy
Shoot you in your fucking mouth and make you talk to me
Yeah, sometimes, I need someone to talk to
'Cause I am not a human being—part two!
Getting paid show money for walkthroughs
Letting all these hoes ride my dick: carpool
My bars passed the bar exam, no law school
Cash Money Army, veteran with my war wounds
Ugh, what your man doing?
I pop his motherfucking top like a canned good
And all my niggas that I roll with are hella armed
And last night, I took a transformer
And had a dream that my dick turned to Megatron
But my girl was sleeping with Decepticons
Money talks, man, and mine talk lecture-long
P-U-S-S-Y: my second home
I be grinding on them hoes like a half-pipe
She say, ""Tunechi, you the shit; you need your ass wiped""
I say, ""Before you gas me up, check the gas price""
Then I make her take this dick like advice, hahaha
She seesaw it, she suck it and enjoy it
I stick it in her ass like some fucking steroids
Jose Canseco, make no mistake
Like a white boy wearing black paint, you're a fake-ass nigga
Brake pads, nigga, wait
You ain't in my weight class, nigga
Looking for the motherfucking man in the mirror
Running this shit like a faucet: Farrah
Barra-cuda, who the fuck you-uh?
I can make your bitch root for me like I grew her
Bodies in the sewer, tampons in manure
90 billion bitches on my stick like a skewer, that's swag
I'm a true Blood, bitch, no fangs
Been went pro, now I'm going pro-pane
Tell a bitch, ""Get off me!"" Bitch, get off me!
I got her over here blowing me like coffee
Decaffeinated, hand me that paper like I graduated
And I get head while it's decapitated, haha
Think it's a game? Nigga, come play
I'm with my killer Bs, fuck bug spray
Yeah, Young Money so gangsta
I personally know strangers, it's so strange
But this girl named Dana like to go anal
Shoot him in his head—what's that? A no-brainer
Plain ol' nigga, but a break from the norm
I wear my heart on my sleeve, so don't be breaking my arm
I'd rather wring your fucking neck before I ring the alarm
I dream to meet a serial killer that'll bring me along with him
I gotta hit 'em like redbones with long hair
Fuck with me, your ass is grass—get a lawn chair
I was fucking before my dick started growing hair
Bitches sweating me like John Mayer or warm air
Man... Nuts and bananas
You know how the tables turn, where are your table manners?
If you fake, put a egg in your shoe and scramble
No rubber, I just fucked this piano, nigga!

Yeah, I see you big bro
I'mma kill these niggas man, yeah

[Verse 1]
Straight off the block with it (Block with it)
Eagle Street to be specific (Be specific)
I'm peeping at you people different
I pay my dues, you keep the difference (Keep the difference)
I can see the end in the beginning
So I'm not racing, I'm just sprinting
'Cause I don't wanna finish (Wanna finish)
They diminish, I replenish
Scientific, I'm out this world, ho
I wear bright red, like a girl toe
No homo, fingernails dirty
I've been counting dirty money since twelve thirty (Twelve thirty)
AM, weigh them, if they short, take them
Right back and spray him, amen
Yeah, I just do my Wayne
And every time I do it, I do my thing
Yeah, believe that, like a true story
Rims big, make the car look like it's two stories
If I hop out, that'd be suicide
No back seats, call that paralyze
I don't have a spine, I don't fantasize
I mastermind, then go after mine
You see I handle mine, I dismantle mine
I tote a tool box, bitch, it's hammer time
So excuse me as I nail 'em to something
I'm just repel 'em, I'mma kill 'em
Someone tell 'em, I'mma kill 'em
I'm gon' fill 'em up, his momma can't tell 'em
And the doctors can't heal 'em
I'mma kill 'em and yeah we sell 'em
I know you smell 'em
And if you want it, you could just yell it
And it be in the morning, at your 'telly
Whole ki go for twenty, half a ki go for eleven
After me there will be nothing
I Am Legend, and I Will Smith

OK, I'd like to thank Kanye
And my nigga Deezle
From giving me this Diesel
Like an F-350
Tank never empty
Damn everybody in the bank act friendly
Used to think my shit didn't stink, boy was I wrong
Approving million dollar deals from my iPhone
I'mma take it one-two-way back
Like a silk wife beater and a wave cap
Or the wave pool
At Blue Bayou
And I waved, fool
As I blew by you
Hello, hi you
I can buy you
But I wouldn't try you
Feed you to Piru
I know what I'm doing
I show and prove
And show improvement
And I know just to go into it
Could never amount to going through it
Whatever or how you wanna do it
We can do it like we late
Ay, wait
Deezle, let me just get the 808
As I hit the kill switch
Now that's how you let the beat build, bitch

My-my scene just a crime scene
Got the high beams and the sirens, yeah
My team, we divide teams
Talkin' dirty money? Check the hygienes
All the dirty money get dry cleaned
Talkin' dirty money, Sam Rothstein
Had my goons kidnap your offsprings
While I was working on my golf swing
Ooh, sweet dreams, sour nightmares
It's a cold world, I got an ice grill
No one man should have all that power
If he can't afford to pay the light bill
I got a forcefield over my heartbeat
The window seal with no door key
I'm poppin' pills to feel more me
Cut off the wings now I'm soaring
And I never feel like poor me
I'd rather feel like the old me
I was born with wheels and I roll deep
I could make the devil get cold feet
Don't light the clove unless it's four leaf
Get a pussy wetter than a coral reef
On my face, I tatted me a fleur-de-lis
Should I get it covered with a coca leaf?
I could tell you better than you showed me
I could show you better than you told me
I'm an OG up in OT
And it's no sleep 'til it's roast beef
I better not hear a Little Bo-Peep
Better go figure, better go deep
Pass no judgement, pass your weed
I'm the GOAT nigga, no goatee

Mmm, sippin' on purple like it's herbal
Bad brown bitch, Lisa Turtle
On turbo, you don't wan' disturb him
Momma put too much sugar in my Gerber
Damn, I done dropped too many ashes on my turban
I done seen so many titties on Bourbon
Live a different kind of lifestyle
Different color diamonds, got a nigga lookin' like sherbert
Stepped to the plate, knocked it out the park
Eat a nigga face like a tiger shark
Dressed in all red like Olajuwon
My niggas hit your safe like the Holocaust
My niggas catch a case, feel like I got Moss'd
My nigga treat the K just like a loft
Got a lawyer and an agent but I'm the boss
And my heart always racin' but never lost
Hello? I was the illest nigga on child support
Now I'm lookin' at the Robb Report
Went and looking at the final score
Bedroom got revolvin' doors
Bitches in and out smilin' more
Than children smilin' at a carnival
Ain't got nothing in common but the common cold
Big Bs nigga, honor roll
Hold up, I think I found the flow
Started from the bottom bitch
Never been monogamous, never been monotonous
Never been anonymous, money is eunonymus
Always had accomplices, always had conglomerates
Always let the chopper clip stick out like a bottom lip
You runnin' out of time so you better know what time it is
You runnin' out of tears and you runnin' out of volunteers
Young Mula bitch, I die for the logo
Cocaine price low, call that a low blow
Tunechi like Pablo, kis in the rowboat
Tunechi in the yacht though, still don't showboat
Sippin' on the slowpoke, movin' like a tugboat
Smokin' like a steamboat, fuckin' on a love boat
Better read the ransom note before you read the love note
Don't know if it's sore throat, deep throat or cut throat

Why me? Oh why, oh why, oh why me?
Why do I look up and see my feet? Am I rising?
But why do my peak look like it's out of my reach?
Why can't I trust what I see?

Oh why am I so kamikaze
Why can't I stay in my seat? I'm so hyphy

Niggas try to bite my style, but my style a jalapeño (Hey)
I got skinny ass jeans, trucks on the pocket (But hey)
Money talks, nigga, I'm caught up in that gossip (But hey)
You know all my bitches badder, and all my swishas fatter (But hey)
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble
And yo main girl is a ho, I go Wayne's World in her throat
She swallow so many nuts, you fuck around, find a squirrel in her throat
I go tapeworm in that ho, let my snake squirm in that ho
Nigga we take turns in that ho, these niggas so green they glow
I am the best thing since wet pussy, on my private jet with my chef cookin'
So big-headed, my neck crooked, my niggas foul when the ref's lookin'
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like Candy Canes

It's not doggystyle, I call it froggystyle (Hey)
You dog her out, I tell her, hop in (Hey)

Gas in my blunt, watching ESPN
And, if that pussy good I wanna see her again
Yeah, I'm from College Park and I got ya broad with me (With me)
Salt water pool, I can put a shark in it (Damn)
Everything authentic (Tru), plus I named my pistols

And if that pussy sweet, I want that candy, trick or treat (But hey)
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious (But—)

Man I'm on some other shit, I want another bitch
That want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I rather punch a brick
'Cause I'm that nigga, and I'm so cold I just shivered

I mean it’s simple
Can’t fuck wit us

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I got money on yo head, I don’t do my dirty work
I cut off my hands, I don’t even touch the work
I pray these niggas don’t fuck with me and I don’t like to curse in church
And my girl’ pussy taste just like Mrs. Butterworth’s
I mean that, believe that

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Don’t be short with that work nigga
We find out where yo ho work nigga
We follow your moms from church nigga
You gonna have to swallow yo pride like a thirst quencher
Get 'em Tune, I don’t really fuck around with certain niggas
Fuck all yall niggas, except my niggas
These niggas hustling backwards
Check your rear-view mirror and your side mirrors
OG Kush keep my mind clearer
That choppa get yo mind right
I got two choppers, that’s chopsticks
Eat yo block up like shrimp fried rice
Been so long since I seen my eyes white
You know I smoke like dry ice
Better stay in your lane or get sideswiped
It’s going down, let me straighten up and fly right
Still can’t turn a ho into a housewife
Man, it’s like some things will never change
You ain’t got a shot in a gun range
These chumps ain’t even got chump change
Uh, yeah, and don’t fuck with me, you know I’m Gotti
Check yourself before I sign it
Yeah, I’m shinin on these niggas, no horizon
Yeah, and it’s going down if I’m her pilot
Uh, my new car is so robotic
My new bitch is so provided, money talks, yours like no comment
Black car, racial profiling, rest in peace to Christopher Wallace
Desert Eagle like the Mojave, I get my work from Rico Suave
Uh, it’s a Rollie if I got time on my hand
If you ever see me broke, write on my cast
Boy, my weed so good, I cry when it’s gone
Had a phone in jail, that’s a cellphone
Yeah, I’m bout to buy a machine gun
We drink it all, leave clean cups, make mountains look like speed bumps
I’m sittin on some train tracks, hopin' that bitch speed up
I’m strong-arming these niggas, roll my sleeves up, yeah
I got bad bitches on standby, all my hoes got cat eyes
Celebrate when a rat die, make a nigga fall back like he getting baptized
Put me in a hospital room, full of flat lines, I’m Tunechi Lee immortal
My name ringing, my name ringing, hello may I take your order?
I say, Testarossa over testimony
Got so much shit built up you could smell it on me
Fuck all y'all niggas in Swahili nigga
Ain’t nothing free round here but Willy, nigga
AK-47, call it Mr. Biggs
All my niggas bloods, fuck your syringe
Chop his head off, put it in the fridge
Try not to mistake that shit for dinner, Dedication
[Verse 2 : T.I.]
Hey let me introduce you niggas to America's Most
Every nigga round with me carry a tote
Sadity bitches, like a nigga Tune on the low
They just be like 10 and be doing the most
Okay, Tune in the jet flyin over the boat
I’m on the way from the Panama, I got a few on the boat
What you niggas make a year, I could do with the blow
You keep on playin with me, bet I’ll put a few in you, ho
The fate of a fuck nigga, we soon to see
These niggas sweet as perfume to me
I mean, really, like cartoon to me
Ain’t nobody fuckin with Tune and me
Hustle Gang, bang green, in God we trust
Young Money, Cash Money, they down with us
I got a bitch who want you bitch, you finna give the ho up
And don’t buck, shawty listen, you don’t really know us
We a bust a nigga head, leave him layin' for dead
I get caught with a banger, I’ma lay in the feds
In gen. pop., nigga, every day in the feds
I was chillin on the yard, really going hard
And these pussy niggas catchin' feelings over broads
King, pussy nigga, but I'm really like a god
A-Town nigga, Bankhead, I’m about it
Everybody know to fuck with me cuz I got it18Embed"

Birdman, put them niggas in a trash can
Leave 'em outside of your door, I'm your trashman
I'm steady lighting up the hash, and, riding in my Jag
You will need a gas mask, man
You snakes, stop hiding in the grass
Sooner or later I'll cut it, now the blade's in your ass
You homo niggas getting AIDS in the ass
While the homie here tryna get paid in advance
I'm staying on my grizzy, I'm a bona fide hustler
Play me or play with me, then I'm gonna find your mother
Niggas wanna eat, 'cause they ain't ate nothin'
But niggas wanna leave when you say you out of mustard
So I'ma walk into the restaurant alone
Leaving out, leaving behind just residue and bones
In your residence with Rugers to your dome
Like, ""Where the fuck you holding the coke?""
Holding your throat, choke

Yeah, yeah
Mmm...

[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care, so who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up
Different city, switchin' women
Puttin' cups up, gettin' fucked up

[Post-Chorus]
And, we don't even talk anymore
Ain't got no time to spare
So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 1]
Damn, love don't live here
Love, I don't live here
She say, ""Why you leave your shit here?""
I'm tryna be sincere
When we both know it ain't right
She hate that we can get loose
But I can never hang tight
But, we don't even make love anymore
Actin' like our phone got our attention
Though we watchin' television, and it's painless
We act like we strangers
I just don't know who we are anymore, damn
I'm not supposed to be here
'Cause love don't live here
But I'm here, and she here
She tell me stay all night
She just want a refill
And then she want to start fights
'Bout ""What about how she feel?""
She tell me I'm a cheap thrill
I know she don't mean that
She think I feed her lies
But I don't get no feedback
As she watch me pack
""Baby where my keys at?""
Kiss her on the forehead and tell her that I'll be back
Her teeth smacked
[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore
Talkin' to the man in her mirror
That been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
But you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care

So who are we to trust anyone?
And that's what's fucked up
We gon' end up by ourselves and not each other
And that's so fucked up

[Verse 2]
I was talkin' to myself the other day
My homies call me cray, my mama tell me, ""Pray""
She say, ""I need a day"", I said, ""I need a bae""
She said, ""Believe in faith
Ma, they love me either way""
Hold up, wait
Let me set my alarm
You say ""Don't sweat your alarm""
And now the pressure is on
So now there's sweat in my palm
But her reception ain't warm
So my deception performs
And then that silence is awkward
Like am I deaf or alone?
I got a jet in the morn'
And she upset and I'm calm
And when a woman is scorned
Is when your welcome is worn
And now her temperature's showin'
And I just weather her storm
And she expect me to stay
I be like, ""Let go my arm!""
She said...
[Chorus]
I don't know who you are anymore​
Talking to the man in her mirror
I've been fuckin' with these bitches
And it's dangerous, sleepin' with these strangers
Every night a different woman, doin' the same shit
And she say, you don't even call anymore
And you don't even care
So who am I to love anyone?
I know it's fucked up

Gettin' fucked up

Shawty badder than a three-year-old
Keep playing and I'ma eat her like a pita roll
I'm just saying, with my love I could feed her soul
Two-day getaway and we don't need our clothes
We at the pool and she looking like a center fold
Two tattoos but she say she getting plenty mo
She got Indian in her family, Seminole
Me and shawty go together like chemicals
And she get mad when I call other women hoes
You send her rose, I pick some flowers and send her those
Tall glass of Merlot get her in the mode
Two tall glasses of Merlot get her out her robe
I whisper in her ear then lick round her lobe
And when she check her watch, it’s never time to go
And with her brain she should make the honor roll
And when I came she caught me like a common cold

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

[Chorus: Drake]
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you baby
With you and only you
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I say damn I must be left
'Cause you the best I ever seen, right
Shawty put me on, you got me going like some green lights
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right
Bet they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing rice
Let's get together over night
Shawty I'm a pro and you are looking like the prototype
Ms. Cita, I took your advice
Sometimes you got to blow it twice then shake it up and roll the dice
I'm cruising on the road of life but I need a passenger
Appetite for loving, ma I'm hungry like a scavenger
I be on that lavender
I be in the bath with her
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

Now she don't know about me but I'ma put her on it
And she ain't sure about me but can't go without me
We probably ain't supposed to be together
But I wonder if our love affair could last forever
And shawty I'm with you
Smoke a lot of weed but I could never forget you
Then I told her to her face
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place

[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Damn you the shit
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit
And I don't really know how to handle this shit
But tonight its moonlight and candles and shit

Because my days is a mess
My nights is a mess, my life is a mess
My life is a mess of happiness
Lust, sex, obsession, desire with no love
Fuck it, my bae is a mess
My side bitch a mess, my wifey a mess
I guess, my bae is obsessed
My side bitch possessed, my wifey careless
But you gon' have to excuse my mess

She gon' have to excuse my ex
I'ma have to excuse her pets
She gon' have to be juicy wet if she gon' ride on this Tune Express
I'ma have to excuse her text
She gon' have to exclude the rest
She gon' have to tell dudes to step
Nigga, to the left, nigga, to the left
Messy, messy on some Percocets
Smoking purple veggie, that's my herbal essence
With a curvy, sexy woman hurting extra 'cause I'm working extra
I just heard her lecture, but I swerved the questions
And reserved a section with a bunch of bitches that prefer the pleasure
It's quarter-to-seven
They just heard the shower water runnin' in the morning
Dirty Devil, I'm a mess
[Refrain]
But I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
And I can hear her teardrops echo
Her teardrops turn into XO
Put yourself in my shoes but you got to tiptoe

Yes, no pressure, it’s a jungle out here
Fell in love with a stripper, Lord, I know she got bills
But I'ma make it rain until she see a flood of ideas
Got me all up in my feelings without knowing what I feel
I'm a mess
And now she over talking about staying over
And she ask could she call her clan over?
I say that's the shit and now we asshole-ing
Now fast forward 'til the morning time
Broken glasses with a bunch of ashes, makeup, and lashes
Out of place mattress, shit happens 'cause my days is a mess

I'm sorry babe, but I gotta let go
Now she feel like she on death row
She don't believe in ghosts 'til I get ghost
