This is a gated community
Please get the fuck off the property (gate!)

'Cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me (woo!)
Niggas be wantin' a verse for a verse
But man, that's not a swap to me (nah!)
Drownin' in compliments
Pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis (Metropolis?)
I think I'm sellin' a million first week
Man, I guess I'm a optimist (milli!)
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us (go!)
What the fuck is you talkin' 'bout?
Saw this shit comin' like I had binoculars, boy

We stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows Versace, the sheets are Versace
I just won a Grammy (woo!)
I been so quiet, I got the world like
""What the fuck is he plannin'?"" (What?)
Just make sure that you got a back up plan
'Cause that shit might come in handy (go, go!)

This year I'm eatin' your food
And my table got so many plates on it (so many!) (damn!)
Hundred-inch TV at my house
I sit back like ""Damn, I look great on it!"" (damn, I look good!)
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga
Don't ask for my take on it (don't ask for my opinion!)
Speakin' in lingo, man, this for my nigga

Bought out the store, can't go back no more

I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl (with you)
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain (Shine!)
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face (Bitch!)
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy? (wealthy)
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor? (professor)
I don't know how you feel can you tell me? (can you tell me?)
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me ('til you tell me)
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time
I know my bitch she so fine
But I don't know what's on her mind
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
Young nigga walking with Nina Ross
I'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong

They say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite
I'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly
The dope that I sell is the purest
The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbine

Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'

Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life

No 20s or 50s, just Benjamin Franklins
Block on lock, call me Kurt Angle
I keep the banger, my brother, my partner
Don't fuck with no strangers, they tryna get famous
I put the hood on my back
When these niggas couldn't do nothing but love it
But niggas still hated
No they ain't real but these niggas gon' fake it
If they got a problem, my niggas gon' straighten it
Niggas debatin', they hatin', they plottin', they waitin'
They want my ice, tell 'em come take it
Have people tell me that I couldn't make it
Now I'm doin' shows outta state in the nations
My momma told me I gotta stay humble
But don't be too ready, you gotta have patience

[Verse 4: Offset]
Droppin' them bangers, bangers, bangers
Double cup stuffed full Texas Ranger
One in the chamber
I shoot a hundred round clip like Wilt Chamberlain
Go to the top and I'm gon' bring the gang in
Bitch, do anything to get famous
My wrist cost me a brick and it's frigid
I'm rich, but I did not let it change me
Statistics say that you niggas ain't gangsta

She on vacation but stripping in Tennessee
I got her number, asked her what she doing later
She said she would hit me on my cellular, (Cellular)
I knew she was digging my pimping
And new Christian Louboutin's forgot to mention. (Red bottoms!)
I brought that bitch in my facility
Told her, ""My favorite room in here's the kitchen, (In the kitchen)
After I whip all these chickens
I watch you get naked and wash all these dishes"", (Wash all these dishes, bitch!)
She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping (Huh?)
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double
Told that bitch, ""Pour your own muddy trouble""
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, (What?)
Shawty broke down and start telling her business
I said to lil' mama, ""You tripping
I don't give a fuck what you did, cause business is business."" (Business is business!)
So now we sitting in my condo, (Top floor!)
I don't even know what to say no more
She's telling me, telling me she don't wanna be a freak no more, but...

Fuck it, I'm makin' 'em pay
It's however niggas wan' take it (Ayy)
I'm havin' my way, 'Set out here havin' his way
Qua' out here havin' his way, and like the third Migo, I take
(Bitch, what?)

What else are they gonna play?
This however niggas wan' take it (Ayy)
I'm havin' my way, 'Set out here havin' his way
Qua' out here havin' his way, and like the third Migo, I take
(Bitch, what? Ayy, yeah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Now that I'm thinkin' it through
I just ain't fell in love 'cause I'm way too awake
And she tried fuckin' a rapper to break up my heart
But my heart doesn't break
Soon as I link with thеse niggas, they feelings are writtеn all over they face (What?)
Okay, great, I'm in the backroom of Wally's, I spent thirty thousand on somebody's grapes
We done did so many pull-ups on niggas, no wonder we gettin' in shape
Too busy backin' my words up with actions to ever go front in your face (What? Ayy)
Shit done changed, billionaires talk to me different when they see my paystub from Lucian Grainge
Told myself that I would get through this verse, and I'm not gonna mention the plane
But look at the plane
The fuck are we sayin'? (Yeah, what?) Fuck are we sayin'?
Big '81, but I don't own a Harley
I ride in Mercedes with Shane (Ayy)
It's me and Lil' Harley, we wreckin' this shit
Then we 'bout to go link with the gang (Ayy)
And unlike that clock on the wall at your mama house
I do not have time to hang
Please don't reach out to me
Think watchin' too much of Stephen done got to me
Verses too eas', I'm servin' them up by the threes
I'm playin' pool in the pool which connects to the beach
I've been too solid to ever have stripes on my sneak's, you get what I mean?
Back in the day, my dawgs was puttin' eight balls in the pockets of all of the fiends, and- (What? What?)
That was back in the day
Now we involved in legitimate business
Baby, we came a long way
Sometimes I hop on the road by myself, and I listen to shit that you say
All of y'all havin' more followers than dollars
And that's why I cannot relate (Ayy, no, what?)
[Chorus: Drake & Quavo]
Load up the Drac'
What else are they gonna play?
It's however niggas wan' take it (Ayy)
I'm havin' my way, 'Set out here havin' his way
Qua' out here havin' his way, and like the third Migo, I take
(Ooh, what? Ayy)

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Load up the Drac' (Drac')
Makin' them fuck niggas pay (Yeah)
Straight out the trap to the play (We gone)
Who said they ain't havin' they way? (Who?)
Might have a lil' more on they plate (Eat it up)
We havin' our way in three ways (Woo)
OVO scope on the Drac' (Ugh)
We havin' our way (Havin' that shit)
Havin' my way in the city, get pulled out your britches
You talkin' or trippin'?
Go put all my cleats on, walkin', ain't slippin' (Walk)
Havin' my way, now this shit like a business
Load up the bases, now I feel like Cal Ripken (Ayy)
She had it her way, now she out of a Bentley (Skrrt)
(Skrrt-skrrt, get out, ooh)

[Verse 3: Offset]
(Offset) Fuck how you take it, we straight from the vacant (Hey)
I caught me some cases, then beat it, then raced it (Hey)
Seen they was hatin', no communication
No invitation, cut off circulation (No)

Crosses all on my body, watch for Satan (Chromes)
I'm havin', GALLERY, LANVIN
No talkin', we smashin' (Smash)
This one a classic, ain't none of this average (Classic)
Sniper, I'm snipin' the bitch, I'm assassin (Snipe)
I piped her, then piped the bitch up for some action (Hey)
Don't even be braggin', these lil' niggas maggots (Maggots)
I don't even flex, that shit be on accident
Fell in my lap, hit your bitch on a accident
I shoot my shot, it's on point, that shit accurate (Bah, ugh)
[Chorus: Drake & Takeoff]
Load up the Drac' (Chk-chk)

[Verse 4: Takeoff]
(Takeoff)
I'm shovin' that shit in they face
Then I go put that boy right in his place
They know that I'm havin' my way (Why?)
I was seventeen on a song with Drake
It's like an eviction notice when we droppin' (Get out)
'Cause niggas get moved out they space (Move)
Two and a half, was going on three
But fuck it 'cause it's worth the wait (Fuck it)
Not to be ignorant, but I want everything that's on the menu but what's on your plate (Give me that)
I talk to God, He give me the faith (God)
I hit the boy if I need me a Drac' (Brr)
I got a Richie that sit on my left (Mille)
But somehow, I always be pullin' up late (How?)
Ain't been on Earth (No) ever since I copped that rocket chain and took a trip outer space (Go)
Ever since birth, my mama told me (Mama) that they gon' act cool, but they really hate (Hate)
I know my worth (Worth), so you ain't gettin' no verse if you talkin' 'bout a lil' 'K (Nah)
Make 'em say church (Amen)
When they see clarity diamonds and stones in my Jesus face
Ain't gotta run 'cause this not a race (Huh-huh-huh, go)
[Chorus: Drake & Takeoff]
Load up the Drac' (Chk-chk)
What else are they gon' play (Fuck it)
It's however niggas wanna take it, ayy (It's up)

They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Let me tell you a story
'Bout this lil' bitch named Tamara
She'll let you smash for sure today
And then smash your partner tomorrow
She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars
Everybody know lil' mama on go
Everybody call her hundred gobbler
Got hoes on hoes like a roster
Is it because of my posture?
But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father
She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket
And break your wallet, and you know she got it
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket
You can not play me
You know you're too wishy washy
Kick her out the house politely
We noticed you was too excited
No we not going for it, no we not going
You're too wishy washy lil' bitch and you know it

Suckin' my anaconda, got the flower aroma
And on my mama I'm not fuckin' these bitches without a condom

If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit
She givin' up her pussy for the profit
Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it
She really wanna be on red carpets
These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible
Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach
These bitches are funny
They're tryna take a nigga's money
I don't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing

But I know that she's plottin' mama said don't trust nobody
This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli
I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better
That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas
Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She askin' me where my umbrella

Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand
She know how to work the pots and pans

My nigga not tryin' to remember my past
Don't come to my hood if you ain't got a pass
Eat up the dab like linguini and crab
Mr. McMahon, I fire you and your staff
Watchin' you niggas dabbin' made me laugh (Haha)
Dabbin' is a way of fashion
Touchdown like I'm Takeoff McFadden
Call a play like I'm Takeoff John Madden
Should get a platinum plaque from all this dabbin'
You niggas should get a Grammy, the way you actin'
Enough of that swag I put it in a casket
Look at my dab, yo bitch droppin' her panties
I feel fantastic, immaculate dabbin'
Stay off my grass, call me Takeoff Stanley
[Chorus: Quavo]
Look at my dab, dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab
Look at my dab, bitch dab

Get in there, get in there, bitch dab

Look at my dab

[Outro: Takeoff]
So now niggas dabbin'
Before it was swaggin'
Nigga thinkin' that it's just a dance
When dabbin' is a way of fashion
See I'm tryin' to teach y'all the rules and regulations
Cause there's a lot of niggas out here perpetrating
No temptations, Migos sensation
Seen a lot of faces, why not make a Young Rich Nation, ayy!8Embed"

If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for? (bitch)
All of my niggas, they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you
And if you thinkin' 'bout calling your mommy, your daddy, your brother, your sister, that chopper hit you, havin' a seizure (ayy)

It's been a long time coming
From young niggas to young rich niggas
It's DJ Durel and I'd like to welcome you to Rich Nigga Timeline

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch the leakin' (ba-bow)
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget (nah, for real)
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about? (Shit)
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot boy, so you know I gotta stay low (hot)
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet (vet)
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check (do it)
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out ""Free Actavis""
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T, pity the fool
Master P, No Limit money, bando jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got Playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me 'til a nigga be cumming
[Chorus: Quavo]
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

[Verse 2: Offset]
When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country

[Verse 3: Quavo]
Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga with a pot of gold like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again
[Chorus: Quavo]
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country

Put my all in that bowl, put my all in it

Now it's no more crying 'cause we upper echelon

Migos! Metro!
I mean all I ever wanted to be
Y'all know what we wanted to be
Uh, rich!

[Chorus: Quavo]
All I ever wanted was some motherfuckin' guala (Money)
Bando used to smell like some stinkin' enchiladas (Bando)
The streets is a jungle, got to watch for the koalas (Snoopers)

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Walk around with large amounts of guala on me (Cash!)
I’m walking around with a pocket rocket, don’t run up on me lonely
Bought my first Audi with the fish scale guts
Now I got the bitches, wanna fuck, they wanna cuddle up
Wanna come to the bando, knock two times then twist the handle
Got everything in stock, whatever you need, just ask me
I’m selling that kush to Asher, Rel Money, got a whole bag of Ashley
Money taller than mountains, drinking lean out of damn water fountains
She so bad gave me erection or eroused, whatever you call it
Bitch, me and my team been balling
Bet your label keep motherfucking calling
Woke up to a bitch this morning, got 16 new text message
10 of em' saying ""go get to the guap"", other 6 saying ""Migos up next""

When I was a kid all I wanted was a hundred dollar bill
Now I’m 19, young nigga want 100 mil
Selling whole things, want an ounce? Can't bust the seal
Wanna be a trapper? Never serve a nigga where you live
In the Bando counting chips no poker, weighing bales of Okra
I got lots of O's, put my name right next to Al Capone
I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Selling that dope to economists, menace to society
On the top of the mountain, you under me
Young nigga, I’m trapping and grinding
No scale for the workers, I'm eying it
You niggas still nickel and diming
Remix the dope and you niggas still buying it

Fuck the rap game cause these rap niggas really ain't shit
I hop in the Audi, I hop in the Bentley
Fuck it I’m smashing that bitch
Young rich nigga with the Rollie wrist
Trapping and capping, I’m selling the birdie
You fuck niggas really ain't serving
Selling the bricks to the plug up in Berlin
Put the dope in the water, hit it with the egg beater
Sipping lean, yeah I'm good on tequila
My neck is so sick, got the measles
This for my my niggas that trap in the Regal
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Put the molly on top of her tongue
She sucking and fucking, she ain’t got no manners
Back to the basics, I’m counting these faces
My pockets inflating off trapping the babies
You niggas fugazi, my niggas, they strapped like the Navy
I’m the mayor, matter fact, I’m the president
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
Throwing the bird with accuracy, all of you niggas is amateur
Pull up in Phantoms, but trap out of Challengers

Pull up and wet up the city don't care about no feelings
I shoot at your children
Pull up and kill 'em don't care bout no feelings
I pop out and shoot at the city
I'm cooking big birds and chickens
I pull up with tons and tons of them midgets
I'm going far as the stars, are you afraid of heights?
The sky is my limit
You're bittersweet like a lemon
Hey I'ma move you up to Beverly but not the Center
Hey Young Thug gon' bite that fish just like its tenders
The way I'm geek'd up don't know one of my members
Hannah Montana, banging in red bandana
10 thousand dollars toe ring right inside of my sandals
My bitch understand us, she ride with the nana
She don't give no fuck 'bout no cameras (Bling bitch!)
She got her a lawyer not goin' to the slammer
Plus she did trial in a Phantom (Rich bitch!)
Imma pull up leave it running, I walk in the club
Don't play I snuck the gun in
My bitch think she dreaming cause I grabbed the Tommy
She thought that I grabbed on my stomach (tummy!)
Cook so much dope it startin to look just like comic
It could make a young kid vomit
Catch a dumb ho, hook her up to phonics
I'm slick and ironic

I'm taking your bitch out to Beverly Hills
And I didn't give her nothing but a molly pill
I'm the Fresh Prince and I live on a mansion, young nigga my daddy not Phil
Me and Young Thugga we drank muddy trouble
My pockets inflating like I blew a bubble
When the mixtape dropping Migo?
Young nigga just wait on it! You acting like undercover (12!)

And it's getting thick on me like peanut butter (""Baw, glaw !"")
Short with the gwalla, I'm coming at you like the headhunter

Pull up on you and your people
Me and my Migos illegal but that choppa legal

He put me on Chico he gave me a kilo
You fuck niggas taking my lingo
Pull up on you get my shit back like I'm repo
Thugger my brother we got different mothers
We fucking these bitches you cuffin' her
Bet you don't know she be sucking me while you've be kissing her!

These bitches be trippin', fucked all my brothers
And expect for me to love her! (I could never love her)

Add up the digits my nigga money on top of money, fractions
My niggas they all about action, no camera
Pull out the choppa, it hit yo' ass hard like the judge, with the hammer
You niggas is monkey
That's why the choppa got a Hundred-round hanging, banana
These bitches be asking me questions like
'Offset why the hell you walking on mammals?'

[Intro]
Yo, Migo
QC

[Hook : Takeoff]
So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me
They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be
I ain't never did a sneak diss
Call my hitman quick to put you on the hit list
I guess they mad cause we young and rich
I guess they mad cause we fucked their bitch

[Verse 1 : Takeoff]
First off B.I.G. may you rest in peace
Killed my nigga Pac and Biggie over jealousy
Vegetarian shooter, he gon' kill ‘bout that celery
Hollow tip that sang it for you, here, feel the melody
Niggas plottin' while I’m on vacation in Beverly
Offset told me press the button like the game of Jeopardy
I’m pressing it, niggas wanna hit me for my necklaces
Diamonds VVS, but that juug was never sent for
You either respect or like Nike, we checkin' you
You fuck nigga try me, my niggas go reckless
Never will you catch me naked, young Mel Gibson, kill lethal weapons
Stomping a fuck nigga out, with thousand dollar Giuseppe's
Boss shit, only boss niggas, in my section
[Hook : Takeoff]
So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me
They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be
I ain't never did a sneak diss
Call my hitman quick to put you on the hit list
I guess they mad cause we young and rich
I guess they mad cause we fucked their bitch

[Verse 2 : Quavo]
Hey hold on, hold on, where Takeoff at?
My brother, Takeoff he in trouble
I’m heating these niggas in 'sace jacket, that’s a $1800 sweater
I’m getting to that cheddar, my life is so better
Fuck nigga mad, ‘cause I’m a trendsetter
Chain got rocks so, I’m looking at your pebbles
I’m rocking the stage and I keep heavy metal
I got the ether like Nas, I’m strapped up with ammo and bombs
I’m telling my nigga go get you because of the money, it itching they palms
""Prrrm doom doom"" that’s a hundred round drum
On Sunday in church with my moms
I'm Asking the lord for forgiveness because he know the dirt that I've done

[Hook : Takeoff]
So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me
They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be
I ain't never did a sneak diss
Call my hitman quick to put you on the hit list
I guess they mad cause we young and rich
I guess they mad cause we fucked their bitch
[Verse 3 : Offset]
Fuck nigga you saying we dissing?
Mistletoe chopper, them bullets, come kissing
Don’t enter Atlanta without no permission
Leave ‘em stanking like chitlins
Got niggas that come threw your chimney
Like the Grinch that stole Christmas
Did a 8 month sentence, I did it, came home to the riches
You niggas ain’t relevant, pussy they pecking that melony
Offset the veteran, putting the pack on the measurement
You niggas got so much jealousy, I keep the pistol with felonies
Young nigga I'mma have to teach you a lesson
""Glaw! Glaw!"" Hit his ass with a Smith and Wesson
Can't go back to jail cause this shit is depressing

[Hook : Takeoff]
So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me
They're jealous, and they envy me (why?)
Cause I'm really, who they wanna be

Splash, drip, islands
Water, islands
Splash, drip drip, lots of islands
Living on the islands

[Verse 1: Quavo]
On the islands cooling like Gullah Gullah
I'm independent I ain't trying to sign to Warner Brothers
We'll take ten mil' for a Label deal
And I don't want the PT if it ain't Double Seal
Life is a gamble game, wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
They wanna fuck with me cause I'm a millionaire
Spectacular, the choppas in the back and in the Frigidaire
You don't even wanna bust a move, come on my fleet
Got them on stand-by on snooze, stand-by my fleet?
I just pushed the button and you lose, you lose my fleet?
POW!

Pushaz Ink the label we the trendsetters
That's yo' bitch, on God, she was just with us

My bitch from the islands I covered her in diamonds
The haters can't stop me from shinin'
Don't play with me nigga, Machete will hit you
Young nigga you know that I'm Haitian
I had to stay down while we trappin' the vacant
Mama she said we would make it
Feels good to be rich
Got a jet, take a trip
Fuck nigga we made it !
The plug on the islands, no Gilligan
I pull out my wallet, finessin' him
I be with the migos, no Mexican
I'm a young rich nigga
I'm buying whatever no matter the cost
Yo' boyfriend about to come fuck with a boss
I ride in a Maybach, no Ross

[Verse 4: Offset]
Welcome to my island
Lions, bears, and tigers
Selling babies, cooking toddlers
Bad bitches givin' knowledge
Welcome to my land
Molly santan' kickstand
Choppas on deck like Iran
Whippin' and flippin' them candy yams
On the islands, no Gilligan
You niggas are sweeter than Cinnamon
I run to the money with energy
My loafers are 'gator amphibians
Rocca been trappin' for centuries
How the hell you don't know Benjamin ?
You run up on me it's a penalty
His pack went missin', a mystery

And after she water whip it, I make that bitch wash the dishes
Enter the Fisker, I'm doing 250, I'm praying I don't get a ticket

Where the fuck you was at when a nigga couldn't get out
I'm rich as a bitch with a smart mouth
Like Martin do Pam, bitch get out
Excuse a nigga if I'm acting rude
You was not there when I had no food
You want to start over I'm not a fool
These bitches not loyal she broke the rules
Trifling bitch I'm not wifing it
Left a nigga when I got indicted
You fucked my partner tryna keep it silent
My diamonds shining like the police sirens
My plug on the boat like a pirate
Pussy niggas they don't like me
Real niggas fuckin' with me
Baby girl you wasn't with me
[Hook: Quavo]
Where were you when I was whipping it in the kitchen
Where were you when I was jugg finessing midget
Where were you when I was facing time off tickets
They wanna come around
Where were you...
(Where) Where were you when I was down and out and I was in the drought
(Where were)Where were you when mama said she gon' kick me out
(Where were)Where were you when I was down on my knees ain't had nun(Where were)

God keep on telling me;
'Please just focus!'
I came from roaches to Lotus
They hung my brother like posters
The Lord he told me I'm chosen
Now all my jewelry is golden
Sipping on purple potion, take away all the emotions (Lean!)
Christian Louboutins, I'm not running from my emotions

Now look at that young nigga can't keep these hoes up out his face

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Unfortunate, ya'll fuck niggas can't fuck with us
Hundred gas bags in the monster truck
Usain Bolt, I'ma run it up
Real street nigga that love to hustle, came from the gutta
My nigga be flexing, pressing
I'm fucking that bitch that you texting
You stressin? (Haha)
We just sitting in here counting cash, trying not to laugh
All of these presidents, OG gas
Sipping on Actavis out the glass
Hundreds older than the ThunderCats
What would you do, if you found out that your face card wasn't approved
Ain't no money getting extorted
Look at that what these streets will do

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I'm attached to the stacks
Still having big straps
Phone tap running laps cross the map hot trap
50,000 on craps
Plug got that baby powder
These niggas out here sour
80k perform for an hour
Should of played for the Dolphins
Should of played for the Saints
Nigga saying it's a drought
Takeoff still having pints
Still playing with that oil
Still playing with that dope
Might catch me on the nawf
Still chopping it up with Bo
I got bitches out in Florida
Having bitches out in Georgia
New bitch hit my phone said she wanna give me dome
Cutting dope by Georgia dome
High school, no diploma
Remember days on the nawf
Now I'm quarterback a coach
Better watch your approach when you pull up on the 'chos
Yeah my niggas having sticks
Mama didn't raise a bitch
Now your bitch always call my phone for motherfucking snow
Today I just met the plug put him in the figure four (coca)
Old Quavo might just pull up and just kick a door nigga
Free my nigga Westside got 5 to the dope nigga
Free my nigga Kobe got 15 to the net (money)
Now I got some hired shooters with the coolants on the TECs
I don't mean no disrespect but I came for the checks (yea)
They free'd the savage Set
Concerts in Quebec

Young nigga hitting them licks
No Label 3
Independent signed for bricks

Never look back and won't sell my soul (never look back)

Don't like it then pay what you owe
Bigger backend at the shows (backend)

Started with a dollar and dream
From riding Impala with them things
To driving Ferraris with them wings, nigga
Young rich niggas, Migo, Meek Milly

[Verse 1: Meek Mill & (Quavo)]
Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
(Let me talk, Meek Mill)

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
[Verse 2: Quavo]
All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now


[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator
[Verse 4: Offset]
I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, ""give a nigga some faith""
Now when I wake up I look at my lake
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!

[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know, M&Ms)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say, bricks)

It's a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist
You showing your benjis on Instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap

It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin' (brrrt-brrrrt)

Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting

Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
I ride 'round the city screaming ""Mama we made it!""
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker

No basketball though

No Clyde Drexler money
Jumping out the gym
Jumping out the gym
Jumping out the gym
No Dominique money
Jumping out the gym

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Money above the rim, Burberry Timbs
Bands jumpin’ out the gym, no Shawn Kemp
Back then she ain’t want me, now I got her salty
Cause she seen Young Quavo flexed up in that Aston Martin
Hurricane wrist, watch Young Quavo break the pot
In the VIP shootin’ nothing but money jump shots
Can't nobody touch me cause my goons like secret service
Pull up, pop the trunk, it's a flock of birdies
Smokin' on purp James Worthy, (purp)
Sippin' on pink like Kirby, (lean)
I already know she thirsty
So I put her in the kitchen dancing dirty
I already know he a coward, I already know he sour
He a snake in the grass so I had to cut him off
I call that Georgia Power
We don’t even kick it like that dog
Quick to spray a nigga like Lysol
Don't get mad at me cause I smashed your bitch
Then I passed her like Chris Paul
Hell nah I don’t need no label
Hundred bands just sitting on the table
Face card so good in da hood
I could go kick shit wit Blocc Gang in Decatur

No Clyde Drexler money

No Dominique money

Eighty piece teeth, Girbauds with the crease
Aw shit look who it is, the white Dominique
Dominique Wilkins, more dough than Homer Simpson
I can ball and tell more story than that Rumpelstiltskin
I done shine different, but I still diamond glisten
Wood wheel twistin’, mysterious roof missin’
40K on wrist, and I’m ballin’ fierce
I done shot more jumpers than that Paul Pierce
Or Kevin Garnett, 'cept I don’t even break a sweat
I’m flying learjet, all-glass clear jet
Me and Migos stackin' C-Notes, DJ Drama
We on vacation, we skyscrapin’ in East Bahamas

Hook shot like ‘areem Abdul-Jabbar
Or lay it up like Nate Archibald
Twenty-one bands on me, Dominique
Shoot a nigga lights out, Pistol Pete
And I called them birds Beyonce
‘Cause they look good and you know they gon’ sing
Thirty birds call them Bernard King
Got thigh, got breast, got wings
Robin jeans got studs on the denim
I dropped three, it wasn’t nothing, Reggie Miller
Man I’m jumpin out the gym, Yao Ming
You're short similar to a Pygmy
A nigga keep a steel like Stockton
Black and grey monster truck, David Robinson
And the paint with the work out in Jers
Got Larry Kush, Larry Birds
Extendo with a whole three five
Hugo cover up my eye
Shooting jumpshot like Brent Barry, Kyle Korver, Jason Terry
And if a nigga try to take my cash, no Pastor Troy, but we ready

Out the gym, straight to Lenox

Got a plug in every city for my shoes nigga
Walk in the store with straight cash, nigga no issue
They like T-James! That's my nigga!
You a real nigga bruh thats why we fuck with ya
My reply is always humble nigga never brag
Tell that cute bitch, ""Show me where them 'levens at!""

So I had to make a mission like the famous Jett Jackson

I don’t know

[Verse 1: Quavo]
You take the deuce of that yellow then drink it
I be like, “Damn, boy!” what is you thinking?
When I hit Henn' bitch fuck it, I’m swinging
Walk in the Nawf, you know that they banging
(You know I got to pull up on the Nawfside one time)
Dope boy mentality, dope boy mentality
Walk in the kitchen, I make a fatality (finish him)
I feel like Takeoff, yeah we moving to Canada
Cause I still feel like people be after us (12!)
I got the chopper don’t challenge us
White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don’t give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I’m sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it’s recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I’ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don’t imitate, the dab I create
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I’m on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don’t beef with no rapper it’s a money race
It won’t be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
I bought Versace shades from Ray (Ray Charles!)
Put a ‘tato on the K
It gon’ be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight
(We straight!)
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table steak and a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It’s a good day today, I’ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don’t speak or say “Hey”
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
Don’t come out the house, you can’t make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I’m cashing out
Used to tell them folks “Put your shit on layaway,”
When it’s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don’t say nothing, Domingo gone get ‘em
After you get ‘em, Domingo gon’ split ‘em
Can’t let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can’t afford a fender bender
Now I’m fucking bitches and I’m Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain’t gonna shoot it with ‘em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain’t talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain’t gon’ give ‘em non’
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas; I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain’t hearing none of that
All them niggas stick ‘em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on ‘em make a nigga do jumping jacks
[Verse 3: Offset]
I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I’m running, I’m not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Muhammad Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I’m a Nawfside lil’ nigga, don’t fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can’t remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap ‘em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deuce deuce in his crotch
Don’t be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage ‘em
Ready for war, ‘case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset; they start to go panic
They know I’m no bullshit; I’m ready to damage
I’m screaming out, “Fuck it,” my cup is still muddy
Don’t kick it with niggas; don’t play “buddy buddy”
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil’ babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It’s cheaper to leave her; I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra
Want to know anything about the bando, I’ll teach you (Whatchu need?)Embed"

Money growing like Pinocchio, nigga, but I ain’t lying
Most of these bitches ain’t mine, I fuck them then move down the line
See that cocaina gon’ bring you to crime
And that cocaina gon’ start bringing the fire
But get caught with that cocaina get time

Looking at my neck and wrist like why I can’t shine
Looking at the i8 like why can’t I ride?

Trappers be biting just like it's a gator
Leaving them holes in a nigga like bagels

When they smell fear you know they poppin' off
I'ma go and fuck your daughter study law
I'ma stand for what I believe 'til I fall
If I never said it, I'm sayin' it right now
Say what you want I'ma shed my pride now
Everybody say fuck the feds and five-o
Gave everybody theirs it's mine now
I'ma make a public announcement, call now
Turn to a blood, them A's went down now
Kinda good lookin', them bitches fine now

Sleepin' on that bitch like I'm comfortable

Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room

I put the fours on 'em
Came from juggin' with bowl homie
Now look all this rose gold, gold yellow gold, gold, gold on me
Yeah mob ties frog eyes
What a time to be alive
No neighbors
House on the hill with the acres
Don't date her
Running through the squad slave her
I'm the mayor
President Huncho a player
Twin chopper, Sonic and Tails
Twin chopper, Sonic and Tails
Niggas love when the birds sing
White cocaine Pinky and the Brain
Love when the box hit the mail
I love when the player wanna bail
I hate when a nigga want problems
But I love to give a nigga shells
God protect me from the evil
Take the squad out the cheetahs
Streets crawling like beetles
But the Stanley Steamer keep me cleaner
You got it out the mud I got it out the oil
You heard the cash prince niggas on Forbes
I'm the plug, extension cord
Got your favorite model on drugs If you ain't know it

Hit it from the back, back, baby throw it back
Have a heart attack, can you handle that?

Bad bitch went to college but she real thotty
That's the reason I can't even trust nobody
Celine and Supreme I'm the dab daddy
She coming home with me when she mad at ya
Sucking on me buckling my knees throw a bag at ya
Molly feel like Hercules when a nigga jab at ya
Hold on wait, Hopping in the Wraith
Stars in the ceiling like I'm living out of space
Manoeuvre like a boss we don't ever leave a trace

Fucking a model bitches big booty little waist

This one for the people that taking drugs everyday
Fuck what they say let the pain go away

So many bitches might catch me on Shade room
Got a Pit bull thinking 'bout copping a Baboon
Free all my niggas like a movie they coming soon

[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I got every drug that start with a letter
Chickens is tender
With her she said I'm ""like Souja Boy the way you tell em""
Breakin' and enter
Free all my nigga locked up in the cell, no cellular
I'm special, but first I was regular
Fuck the feds and free my niggas that’s federal
Couple scammers and some decimals
I'ma feed 'em to the animals
I let 'em play in the back with them lions
'Til he run out of the stamina
I told him ""he stealing"" he told me I'm lying
I told him I got him on camera
Act like I wanna make music with ya
Just to hit you and your manager
[Outro: Quavo]
Fuck it, crown the kings
Crown the kings
Fuck it, crown the kings4Embed"
