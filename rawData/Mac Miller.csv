I switched the time zone, but what do I know?
Spendin' nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
I could fly home, with my eyes closed
But it'd get kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
[Verse 2]
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
[Verse 3]
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
I'll finally discover
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover

Yeah, okay, you gotta jump in to swim
Well, the light was dim in this life of sin
Now every day I wake up and breathe
I don't have it all but that's all right with me
Take it nice and easy, took a flight to see me
Send you back home with a light that's beamin'
The whole team 'bout to figure it out
We ice cold, that's what winter about
And sometimes, sometimes I wish I took a simpler route
Instead of havin' demons that's as big as my house, mhmm
Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah
Isn't it funny? We can make a lot of money
Buy a lot of things just to feel a lot of ugly

Yeah, they ask me what I'm smilin' for
Well, because I've never been this high before
It's like I never felt alive before
Mhmm, I'd rather have me peace of mind than war
See, me and you, we ain't that different
I struck the fuck out and then I came back swingin'
Take my time to finish, mind my business
A life ain't a life 'til you live it, I was diggin' me a hole
Big enough to bury my soul
Weight of the world, I gotta carry my own
My own, with these arms I can carry you home
I'm right here when you scared and alone, and I ain't never in a hurry
You don't ever gotta worry
Even when it's 7:30 and the time is runnin' low
When your heart get cold
See what's behind all them unturned stones
And I'm a pro when it come to my job
But really I'm just tryna start believin' in God
Now when it gets hard
I don't panic, I don't sound the alarm

I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch
Getting high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit
But these bitches getting obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit
Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights
And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be
Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out
Ooh shit, with my new bitch, you jealous now, smokin' weed at the crib watching Belly now (Alright)
All the pain that they causin' like, fuck it, we ballin', now everythin' straight
You feeling the feeling, I'm chilling, just living, I'm burning away

Wondering what's the thing that keeps me breathing: is it money, fame or neither?
I been thinking about the places that I frequent, all the people that I see
I’m just out here livin' decent, what do it mean to be a G? Yeah (Alright)
And all the time we fall behind, bitches in the concubine, I call her mine, crazy
She ain't God as I, I make water wine, pausin' time, it's common, they often hate me
Never will I walk in line, I cross the T's and dot the I's, wondering, well
Wonderin' how I got this high, fell asleep and forgot to die, Goddamn
I'm poppin' them downers and drinkin' them powders, faded
Get it over the counter, I'm stuck on the browser, like, how did I make it?

People love you when they on your mind
A thought is love's currency
And I been thinkin' 'bout her all the time
I never seen somebody put together perfectly
What would I have to do to call you mine?
Someone like you is so hard to find
You can open up your eyes, or you can walk in blind
All I ask is that you hurry, I won't hurt you, don't you worry
Listen to me, I'ma set you free
He ain't gonna break your heart again
Go through the worst to reach the ecstasy
When your imagination's on pretend
I never thought that it would feel this way
You never taught me how to heal the pain
I wish you caught me on a different day
When it was easier to be happy

[Chorus]
Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
Sound of silence as they all just watch you
I kinda find it strange how the times have changed
I wish we could go and be
Free once, baby, you and me
We could change the world forever
And never come back again
Let's leave it all in the rear-view
Let's leave it all in the rear-view, girl
You don't have to cry
You don't have to cry
[Verse 2]
Mend a broken heart, girl, if you can
I don't expect you to be capable
You got the world right in your hands
That responsibility is unescapable
I promise that I'll be a different man
Please give me the chance to go and live again
I'm havin' some trouble, can you give a hand?
It seems perfection really is so unattainable
Don't even say you 'bout to end it all
Your life precious, ain't no need to go and kill yourself
I'm not so sure that there's an end at all
I wish the truth would just reveal itself
Who do you call to make it to the top?
And who do you call to make the shootin' stop?
And who do you call to give the coupe a wash?
After everything I did, I think I'm still myself

Just a little taste and you know she got you
Can you hide away? Can you hide away?

It's the rap diablo, macho when I drop flows
The bar gets raised up, it's me and Petey Pablo
Colder than gazpacho, colder than the mono
Rappin' head honcho, rockin' shows like I was Bono
I go play a couple keys on the piano
The industry a lie, all the promises were hollow
Follow me, I could show you where we be's at
How'd I get my G-pass? None of your fuckin' beeswax
These raps bring a joint together like a kneecap
Fuck the little 8 balls, show me where the ki's at
The time continuum, Mortal Kombat finish 'em
Tryna find a balance, reachin' from my equilibrium
Fools I pity 'em, I'm not a human, I'm amphibian
Fake superhero like the Mystery Men, I ain't savin' nothin'
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin', skippin' all the famous functions
How do the famous function? The A-list can't be trusted
I strong-arm 'em like I play the trumpet
The bottom barrel of society
I tell my bitch if she don't love me, then just lie to me
I'm finer than the winery
Take it from the rich, this is piracy (Piracy)
Finally, I don't even need my fuckin' eyes to see
Come and die with me

Lava makin', so hot I'm turnin' hog to bacon
Only God can save him, I heard the monsters made him
I ain't a star, I'm way farther with the constellations
Contemplatin' suicide like it's a DVD
Lost inside my mind, it's a prison, homie, leave me be
You can see me bleed, I be with the freaks and geeks
Bitch, I never miss a beat, I'm Charlie Conway, triple deke

Been a beast, every word I spit rewritin' history
Look at what you did to me, look at what you did to me
Run into the underworld with guns and set the sinners free
No bitches in my circle, I'm the show, you the commercial

Treat you like a urinal

I never take a day off
Work around the clock, my engineer gettin' paid off
Rock like Aesop, light the weed and take off
So high I cannot see, Adolf
Now I got these rappers all breakin' up a sweat
'Cause every time I get up on the mic, it come correct
And I learned it from the best, always dressed in somethin' fresh
Lookin' for a little dime, big butt and nice chest
Yes, they heard I used to rock Guess
But now I'm rockin' clothes that ain't in the stores yet
Travel back in time, I'm in a vortex
Tryna make it work out, think I need more reps
Used to take a bus, now the boy board jets
'Cause K.I.D.S. got me buzzin' like a fuckin' hornet
They say I got next, tell them that I got now
It's all Disney, boy, my family Proud
Make 'em say, ""Ow,"" make 'em say, ""Oh""
The hoes that tell me ""Yes,"" the same ones that tell ya ""No""
Whoa, I ain't just an Average Joe, way above the average flow
Boy, my life is Most Dope, uh

[Chorus]
No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile
Pursuit to be happy, only laughin' like a child
I never thought life would be this sweet
It got me cheesin' from cheek to cheek, ayy, ayy
And I ain't gonna wait for nothin'
'Cause that just ain't my style
Life couldn't get better
This gon' be the best day ever
[Verse 2]
If it ain't about a dream, then it ain't about me
Go a couple full weeks without a good night's sleep
Imagination, makin', musical creation
The journey that I'm facin' plus the paper that I'm chasin'
Got me crazy, half-insane, and with the lames I see you hatin'
But there's nothin' that you changin', thumbs up, I'm maintainin'
No complainin' when it's rainin', I'll be in another zone
Move out my mother's home to a world I call my own
I ain't gonna play around no more
Find a difference from the ground and the floor
If we got a fight, I'll be down for the war
Thumbs up, homie, I'll be sure

No matter where life takes me, find me with a smile

Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, ""fuck it""
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Refrain]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit

And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly

So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waster of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition 'bout these women and suspicion
Got me lookin' at shit different, how a man in my position
Can't start slippin' down these slopes 'cause it's all just downhill from there
As a kid I didn't learn that, but now I'm aware
When you a youngin' you just tryna live your life and have some fun in
A world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep 'em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you 'bout to leave it to these young kids
And we gon' show you what the love is...

A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on a idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, ""Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable""
Just continue livin' life, 'cause enough of 'em don't

The sun is slowly fallin', we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh, you left your phone behind?
Identity crisis, break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless

That coast the line on the margins I rhyme, you chokin' or soakin' up game
I'm hopin' you picked the second one, shame

Brought a double cup of Drano (Drano), some soda for the flavor
Uncontrollable behavior with some psychopathic tendencies
Lonely as your neighbor with the bitches, he got special needs (Sheesh)
Word to my denim fiends, I'm Kennedy on ecstasy
My flavor from the nature, need an acre for my recipe (Please)
They got my soul, but I don't let 'em take the rest of me
My melody, a little like Kenny G's, it's heavenly
And my denim tailored (Tailored), me and Action rappin'
Al be fuckin' with the fader (Fader), sippin' mind eraser
Actually, we rappin' for the fuck of it
Takin' money from you, gonna smack you out in public
You the Republican government
Abundance of substance, have a consumption to fuck a bitch (*Woman moans*)
With your Banana Republic fit, go suck a dick
And your bitch lookin' like Cousin Itt, the ugliest

Hands are fuckin' hotter than the leather in the six in the summertime (Uh)

And so my daughter can be a lawyer and reap the spoils

I keep it true and ain't no motherfuckin' fakin' that
I get a fade and then I fade to black
Bet on the Razorbacks, I hold the multi-colored flavored gat
Blat!

[Verse: Loaded Lux]
You was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps
Who the fuck is Mac Miller?
This name says ""Crack dealin' trap nigga slash cap peeler
Back with a black stripper
Ass thicker than a snack wrap snicker, too fat to snap zippers""
In half is what I'll do to Mac Miller
Now my mind's first track figured
A nigga who treats his yak richer than elixir, taps liquor
Then pass 'til it goes around the room, like his casket finna
Oh, you Mac Miller?
The fact's filtered in the snapped picture
My man Jack ripped over Google like Jack the Ripper
You-hoo! I'm finna murder this brunette bitch
Get pumped like a flat fixed to become a flat fixture
A rap figure that look like you hacked Twitter
I'll show you ""beastie,"" boy
You can't match a killer with that, wigger
I'd rather attack Tigger or Jack Thriller
He got track fillers for a album
If he had Jigga on an ad-sticker
Wouldn't go cat litter where I'm from, Malcolm
I knock the thoughts off your balcony, King
You're from a home of funny bones
Not like quite the one I've known
You look like, before you punched in flows
You were struckin' blows, bloody nose for your honey roll
In the lunchroom gettin' yo money stole
You a bully's best day ever, with them Nike's on your feet
Comin' through Blue Slide Park
I'm gon' rob this chump
On a party on Fifth Ave like he Donald Trump
Nigga, give me that shit!
I liked you better when you was Easy Mac with the cheesy raps

I'm thinkin' maybe I should thank you
Oh, baby, I should buy you another round
'Cause you care, and I swear that I'm here, but I'm there
It's gettin' harder to hunt me down
Get away to a place with a lake, such a great view
Leave the bank, couple hunnid thou'
I made it, but I hate once I build it, I break it
That might just break me down

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
And all I ever needed was somebody with some reason who can keep me sane
Ever since I can remember, I've been keepin' it together, but I'm feelin' strange
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'
It's likely they might be, but...

[Chorus: Baro Sura]
You remind me
Shit, I need to stay in line
You damn well are a great design
You, despite bein' an only child
Say you need more of a family 'round
Let's turn these genes into hand me downs

[Post-Chorus: Baro Sura]
Down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down
Down, down, down
[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah, well, I'm just being honest, my conscience ain't doin' bad
Because I try to minus the problems that I attract
And half the time, the wheels that's in the back of my mind
Just keep on turnin' 'til the tires flat and burn until the fire crack
I do not lie, though, facts may seem a little farfetched
That's only 'cause I may be make-believe and full of darkness
When I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
Walkin', droppin' change inside your empty guitar case
That's charity, um, I move carelessly, that's why I'm always trippin'
I guess it's like electrolytes, you help me go the distance
Not too efficient, but the way it's always been
Until the day we have to meet again

[Pre-Chorus: Mac Miller]
Get away when it ain't really safe and it don't seem right
But what's new? You get used to the bullshit, the screws, they go missin'

I'm swimmin' a bit, but deeper in thought
Keepin' my head on top of my shoulders
Into some shit, I'm out of the box

Well, I'ma, I'ma maintain how I'm stayin' so high
Put the ladder all the way up 'til we touchin' the sky
And you know you're dead wrong, you're in love with a lie

Lovin' how I fit you
Blow the whistle when you run out of time

Do you mind if I blow yo' mind?
A little closer, baby, don't be shy

Little delayed, but I came and you cool wit' it
I don't trip, flip or lose my grip
And I don't know it all, but I do know this
Before you know me, better know self
I've been in this shit so long that it don't smell
I turn the hotel to a castle
Livin' like a king for a grand
I don't do nothin', that's a hassle
Besides, even that castle made of sand
Just might slip into the sea
Fuck it all, if it all ain't me

I'm just tryna fuck and she just need tuition
Why you tryna stunt, you need to play your own position
Never gave a fuck, yeah, nothin' 'bout me changed
Still roll up them blunts, got diamonds in my chain, haha
Yeah, you heard me I got diamonds in my chain
And it don't make a difference if you cryin' in the rain
Two hundred shows, I'ma kill more, I just sold out that Fillmore
Got a million, make a mill' more, then a number one spot on the Billboard

Roll one up, pour a cup, watch the world go up in smoke

Ah, man, man, it's crazy bein' so rich, man, damn

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
In '09, we were still on the bus, nigga
Before Nak was deluxe, when I didn't have a brush
When there still wasn't hoes tryna fuck with me
'Fore I cleaned up a bit like it's company comin'
I ain't know we was on the cusp of the money
Tryna get a few bucks under custody
And my twin brothers was all Syd brothers
So my kin gully and my skin toughened
Thick lens coverin' my eyes now
They ain't bright, nigga, I'm just high now
And if this a different way to clear my mind out
I need to find out, I'm doin' fine now
And I don't look as stupid when I talk now
And everybody at the show look astounded
Posted up drowsy
In the cut so much that it's pus round me
Catch him in the daytime or dusk hours
Smokin' out the pound, houndin' mutts out it
If your tucks lousy then you can't sit with us (Nah)
Can't call it harsh livin' when the margin between you and all these fuck niggas is about as large as it gets
And you workin', givin' arm and a leg
Say he workin' but he just talkin' 'cause he ain't workin'
Like a long-distance bitch
Who you know that's out that's harder than this?
Chargin' niggas like a Tomlinson win, nigga
Slight frown on the brow on the brim, color brown
Runnin' wild on the route that was picked
When the clouds were enshrouded
I'm out with my face in the shallow end, drownin' again
[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul

[Verse 2: Da$H]
Drugs got me feelin' like Vigo Carpathian
Just look at the state he's in, yo, yo
The most critically acclaimed, slang contortionist
That ain't suckin' corporate dick
Said it with my balls in grip
Other hand got a cork to hit
All this Ralph be the sportsmanship
Walked in and said I needed all the chips
As well as the one on my shoulder
Feel like my heart got pneumonia, blunt laced, covered in odor
Cops still lockin' niggas up for quotas
Brain still numb from the shit in the soda, so
A generation lost
Facin' a Paul Allen in vacant loft
Warrants bein' filed for the cases fought
And them drugs get obtained by debatin' cost
You ain't Superman when that cape is off
Just Clark, nigga, sittin' in his high-rise
Tryna see the bright side of life
And a nigga just keep comin' back with a dark picture
It's like hard liquor, and see people are books
So you judge a ma'fucka by the first page
And a bitch by the back cover
The crime is long-sleeved, so the tats covered
Real ones, I'm the last brother, when they see me on stage
They said my shit was so insane, it was like Cobain did his last number
Motherfucker
[Chorus: Mac Miller]
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinkin' from a shallow soul (Yeah)
Shallow soul (Um), shallow soul (Yeah)

Yeah, well
Isn't he dizzy off the ups and downs?
He got a lil' Whitney, put it in a blunt for now (Smoke)
Shit was s'posed to get me high
Why the fuck I wanna die now? (Damn,) and I'm
Strung out on this dusty couch
In a big white ugly house, I tell the bitch, ""Slow down
(Down) Stop runnin' your mouth
You holdin' my money, just shut up and count,"" my (Woo) (Count my)
Right nostril hasn't worked in a week
Plus the plug got work, like he servin' for a sheik
Me, I'm swervin' in a Jeep
Burnin' weed, doin' circles in the street (Skrrt,) yellin'
""Play my shit or wake the baby up!"" (Wake up)
I get her faded, put it back in her labia
All my life I've been afraid of powder
All my life I've been afraid of power, where did all that go?
The wrong decision always call my phone (Okay)
Last supper I was fuckin' with the Corleones (Uh-huh)
I need somethin' stronger than a cortisone
That can save me from the war I know
Shout out to Soulo (Soul!), and rest in peace Alori Joh
The devil on the other side of this glory hole (Woah)
Any time, any place, you can bet I'ma eat
'Cause my hand on the fork and the fork in the road (Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah)
Woah, look at all these new faces
I see, I see, I see
They comin' on a plane but they're leavin' their suitcases
Been a criminal before scales were digital
Used to put the weed in the sole of my blue Asics (Woah) ([?])
Hate myself, fuck the strangers (Woo)
But the raps are just way too flagrant, so
Here I go (Here I go)
Throwin' up a prayer, it's a Hail Mary
(Woah, where it's at) I've never been religious
But I feel like the scripture's got it all there
It's not just gypsies and fairies (Fairies,) this could be my last breath
(Last breath) I'ma take my time
(Wait a second, please)
'Cause I'ma go out the same way I came in:
Right by the pussy with nothin' on my mind
[Outro: Mac Miller]
You are standing in a shallow soul
You are speaking with a shallow soul
Shallow soul
I could drown you with a shallow soul
Will you wash your sins with me?
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are drinking from a shallow soul
It will set us free
Shallow soul, shallow soul
You are standing in a shallow soul

Just wanna ask you a question, um, have you, have you
Have you been in love, before?

You like your vodka with a little touch of lime
You should pro'bly take your heels off, 'cause you been runnin' through my mind
Oh baby, they say we're no good for each other
And I can't really tell, what is this spell you put me under?
Your love's not too kind to me
I hate the pain, these days of rain
You playin' games of hide and seek, my love
And I'm still tryna find you, I'm lookin' for you, babe
And I'm still tryna find you, through sunshine or rain

You got your stained glass iris, diamond behind your eyelids
Autopilot fly, my heart skip a beat like a scratched CD
Your skin smell like butterscotch and your lips taste like kiwi
Let's take a plane to Fiji, make a date, let's take it easy
Love is power, swear there's somethin' 'bout her that make me nervous
Mother Earth done gave us all a gift, she made you perfect
Let's eat some mushrooms and go to the circus
Girl, you know I'm lovin' you just like you deserve it (Ou)
So, baby, make me earn it, show me the way you work it
Tell me what you afraid of, I'll spit you my favorite verses
Let's... just go take a breath
I want it all, every ounce of love that you got left
You are my drug, in love to death, feel free to fall, you are a catch

If her love don't last forever then forever ain't the same, yeah

And I know that nothin' lasts forever (Nothing lasts forever)
Nothin' lasts forever

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
And she is cool, calm and collected, I knew that you was the one
When I seen ya, leave me breathless, a-okay, I need a second
Day-to-day, give me attention, I want to take care of you
Marry you, somethin' I'm prepared to do, there can't be two
You was here, I ran from you, scared to take that step
But now that I am ready, you not, you up and left me
Hope your new man make you laugh like I do
I do not mean to worry you with my obsession, I just want to be beside you
I'm too nice, and I had to pay that price
Everything I do is wrong (Wrong,) everything you do is right (Right)
Let's start a family, hold on to forever, baby
Your pussy is a palace and your head is crazy *Woman moans*

I don't act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin' out, lookin' at a bunch of Google map stars
Shit, they got a app for... that

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
But me, I'm still trapped inside my head
It kinda feel like it's a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I'm livin' paradise, so what I have to worry 'bout?
Dealin' with these demons, feel the pressure
Find the perfect style (Perfect style)
Makin' sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience a touch of my epiphany in color form
Difference between love and war inform me, I'm above the norm (Above the norm)
Give me anybody though, I'll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhymin' like it's summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven't picked a major label, think I'm blackballed
I still don't got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don't know what I'm runnin' from, but I'm runnin' still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it's nothin' real
I'm from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn't make me sign a fuckin' deal (Fuckin' deal)
Money kills, that's the truth, it's called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls-Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you don't talk about some money, I'ma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that's lettin' me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let 'em go (Let 'em go)
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow (Would let it slow)
That's just me all wildin' out and bein' extra though (Extra though)
Yeah
[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
And if God was a human, it'd be yours truly
Watchin' horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinkin' this decor suits me (This decor suits me)
I do drugs, get more loopy
I'm in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals, it's blissful (It's blissful)
Lookin' out as far as eyes can see
I'm glad that me and this elevation could finally meet (Could finally meet)
I think I'm JFK's final speech, they try assassinatin' all of my beliefs
(But I'm asleep) So whisper to me for the peace of mind
And he be high, some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine (Shrine)
Twenty thousand on my watch 'cause I needed time
If y'all would leave me the fuck alone, that'd be divine (Be divine)
Yeah, can't decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it's just not the same (Not the same)
I'm lookin' out my window, ashin' on the pane (Ashin' on the pane)
Shit, wonder if I lost my way (Lost my way)

[Verse 3: Delusional Thomas]
Yeah, don't you ever wanna hide away? (Hide away)
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won't give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today (Die today)
I'll greet the devil with a smilin' face (Smilin' face)
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, times are wastin', I'm freebasin' with Freemasons
My girl's switchin' the locks, the keys keep changin' (Keep changin')
Dreamin' of places, my own personal creations
If there's a party in Heaven I plan to leave wasted (Leave wasted)
Retracin' my steps way back to Biblical times
We-we all gon' end up meetin' at the finishin' line

When I had nothin', shit, it wasn't so funny
Made a promise to the homies nobody go hungry
Look how far we came, still they throwin' dirt on my name
But it never worry my brain
Heads turnin' like a hurricane swervin'
Tell the sun, ""Get up outta my shade""
If they don't get the picture, cut 'em outta that frame, shit

I think I know it all but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you're broke? Yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk, but I never been tall, yeah
I might trip, I never fall
God knows I came close (Don't try this at home)
I know I probably need to do better
Fuck whoever, keep my shit together
You never told me bein' rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in a rush, I've been thinkin' too much, but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us

They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And the stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawin' shapes and lines of a world we made

Starin' at the wall and the wall full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be?
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but it's cool, that's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move

Will you come home with me?
Just take your clothes off, babe
Know that we been talkin' on the phone all day

Tell me when and where, I bet I won't be late

[Outro]
Hello, I would like to tell you about my love affair with my husband and the wonderful ways that we were able to understand each other, and find out about each other. We got to know each other little by little, living very close in the same building, and he would help me with things, and I would see him and think ""what a cute guy,"" and he was a cute guy. And it was just little by little, we got to know just to say hello. One day I invited him to a party and I had heard so much about him, people respected him, and he was good to everybody, he knew, people he worked with all adored him. And it was something so important, the respect that you have for somebody, for me was the most important. Being attracted to him and being... finding people respected him and I respected him. I love the fact that he sensed how my feelings were, and I learned to understand and respect and see his feelings and understand his feelings ahead of time...
So, it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together, we learned more and more about each other. After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends, the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys. And...my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys, and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life. A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too. And how important it is to love, respect and care for each other.48Embed"

Ingenuity influenced by your eulogy
Going through memories like they were movie scenes
I know I been the shit, all these people full of me
I admit, I guess I'm full of myself, too
There's just a bunch of shit, I wish I could tell you, but
This life move fast, I never knew that
Yours wouldn't have lasted, the dirt hitting your casket, like raindrops
I swear I'll let you know when the pain stop
For now, I need to run to any place that a train stops
And everybody wanna talk to me about some business shit
Never really listening, couldn't get real interested
My days gettin' darker, so the haze get sparked up
All this hate sound the same when my name get brought up
You had a girl, I kinda wish you knocked her up
So I could meet your son and talk you up

I remember
When we were just kids
We knew nothing at all
And we would talk about the life we lived in

Lost somewhere out in

It's a
Dark sign when your friends start dyin'
Like, ""How could he go? He was part-lion""
Life goes on, the tears all dried and
Couple years are gone by by then, uh
Can you please help me find my friend?
I give you anything you need multiplied by ten
I heard he moved to a place where the time don't end
So you don't need money, all you got is time to spend
Yeah, life's short, don't ever question the length
It's cool to cry, don't ever question your strength
I recommend no limits, intricate thought
Go 'head, just give it a shot, you'll remember shit you forgot

'Cause way back then I didn't know shit
And I don't know shit now
When the world's lookin' hopeless

Too many whips, gotta get a new garage made (That's the ball game)
I might steal one just to drive it in a car chase
Me and my bizarre ways (Lord have mercy)
I moved up from a Private to a Sergeant, you can see it from the scarface
Hidden in a dark place, swimmin' in a shark tank

Blame the drugs, got me sinnin' on a weekday
Drunk as fuck, do a buck sixty on the freeway (Skrrt)

Broad's a baton, pass her off like relay
Why I'm so mad on my B-Day?, she say
""I thought you got sober,"" then I said
""I wish you'd stop bein' a bitch and get to mindin' your business""
Told me, ""Money has changed ya""

Ah, yeah
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
Shit would be simple, problems would be in the past by now
Me and the homies would be sittin' on millions
Reminiscin' on times when we were so broke and livin' in Oakland just chillin'
I thought I'd have it in the bag by now
I thought that we'd be kickin' back by now
I know that life is a bitch
I know that life is a bitch, I thought we'd put her in a cab by now
But I'm stressin', I can't relax
Swallowin' my pride and I'm hidin' what's makin' me mad
Everybody sayin' I need rehab
'Cause I'm speedin' with a blindfold on
It won't be long until they watchin' me crash
And they don't wanna see that
They don't want me to OD and have to talk to my mother
Tell her they coulda done more to help me
And she'd just be cryin'
Sayin' that she'd do anything to have me back
All the nights I'm losin' sleep
It was all a dream, there was a time that I believed that
But white lines be numbin' them dark times
The pills that I'm poppin', I need to man up
Admit it's a problem, I need to wake up
Before one mornin' I don't wake up
You make your mistakes, your mistakes never make ya
I'm too obsessed with goin' down as a great one
But if you wait too long they gon' find someone to replace ya
So I guess this is a letter
To all my brothers, Most Dope, that's forever
I love you more than words could express
And this the part that Q start cryin' if he ain't already yet
I did my best to be a leader you respect
At times I became weaker, got defeated by regret
So tell my baby I love her
And if she give me the chance I'll put a seed inside her, make her a mother
Just know that there's a place
Where all my people worry free and e'rybody straight
Every devil don't got horns, every hero ain't got capes
Open up my eyes, shit, I'm finally awake, good mornin'
Yeah, good mornin'

Though my faith is weak
Without you so please, baby, please
Give us a chance
Make amends and I will stand up 'til the end
A million times, a trillion more (Hey)

Hey, homie
Don't be mad that your girl loves me (Don't cut anything yet)
It's not my fault (Yeah)

Yeah, well

[Verse 1]
I got a bone to pick like roses (Roses)
I ain't feelin' broken no more
Balled a fist, they gossipin', I notice
Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives
Wonder who the fuck we're supposed to be
I ain't worried now 'til I leave
I'm just tryna ride and feel the breeze
With somethin' bad beside n' next to me
Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great
You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk
And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif
(That's a motif) Yeah
When it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer
Never felt so damn good where I'm at
I don't know what it's all about
Runnin' through too many thoughts to count (That's way better)
Still ain't addin' up, I'll let you know when I've had enough, yeah
Yeah, well

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd put some money on forever, but I (Hey)
Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I
Just watch while
The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon
The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know
Hey, well

These are my wings
These are my wings, yeah
These are my wings

[Verse 2]
Yeah, well
Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (Slow)
Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah
Love so much that my heart get broke
I don't really know how the normal shit go, so
I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear
Listenin' close as I can
Growin' up (One, two, three), jump
Nobody holdin' my hand, no
Trust is a problem, never knew how, yeah
That's why I just keep to myself
Get what I need, then I'll be out (Please tell me)
Who can surf the universe with me?
Lucifer is human, so are we
All I ever want is what I need
And that don't include your time and company
Follow me, we on the up and up
Remember when I owed a hundred bucks?
Now, I look around like, ""What the fuck?""
If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up
[Pre-Chorus]
I know I need to watch my temper, so I
Don't ever gamble on the weather, but I
Just watch while the

This sun don't shine when I'm alone
I lose my mind and I lose control
I see your eyes look through my soul
Don't be surprised, this all I know
I felt the highs and they feel like you
See, a love like mine is too good to be true
And you too divine to just be mine
You remind me of the color blue
Girl, I'm so in love with you, yeah
Girl, I'm so in love with you
[Bridge 1: Mac Miller]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah (Baby), yeah, yeah
Um, well

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Baby, you were everything I ever wanted
Bought a wedding ring, it's in my pocket
Planned to ask the other day
Knew you'd run away, so I guess I just forgot it
Remember when you went away to college?
Hours on the phone, we end up talkin'
Past, present, future, all the gossip, God damn
Puppy love ain't what it was, darlin'
Feelings that we have are so alarmin'
I can make you laugh, I can break the glass
If we made it last, it'd be a bargain
Mr. Charmin', that is my department
You was there before the fancy cars and
You was there when I was just a starvin' artist
When the car was havin' trouble startin'
Now we got our own apartment, same box for the mail
Same hamper for the laundry, the food in the fridge is stale
And this mornin' you cooked the eggs with the kale
I tried to hit it while you was gettin' dressed
You said, ""All you ever think about is sex""
I'm like, ""Oh well, you know me so well
And if this what make you late, I swear, I won't tell
And every time I call your phone, you better pick up your cell
I swear to God I'ma freak out if it go straight to voice mail""
Well, I'm the jealous type
But I swear that ass is what Heaven's like
And when I'm in that pussy, it's a better life
That's the only way I'm tryna end the night
It's my only chance, I better get it right
[Bridge 2: Mac Miller]
Take your time, my baby
It's all waitin' for you, for you
I know I make your mind go crazy
But it's all waitin' right here for you, for you

[Outro: Bilal]
You get closer with, run away
All I ever known is the color gray
Your lovely ways bring me sunshine
I found an angel so divine
Heaven probably not the same without you
But now you're in my world, in my world

But I ain't in the shower and I ain't gettin' baptized (No)
To the good and the bad times (Bad times)
All the cuts, broken bones, and the black eyes (Black eyes)
Young motherfucker with a mad mind
Made a couple million off of rap lines

Came from the basement under that floor (Floor)
You don't come close, you don't even know I'm the G.O.A.T. (Hmm)

If a car about to hit me, then he ought to beep (Uh-huh)
Watchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothin' con-cer-ete (Whoa)
I came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change wit' us, but come to the same difference (Okay)
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I'm no God
I don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs 'cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan

Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you (Nope)
Been contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are 16's and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo

Snowflakes keep fallin' on my expired debit cards
Don't know why I'm still awake, I gotta be up at ten tomorrow
Missiles in my repertoire, I'd say I'm pretty regular
I never leave my house, I don't know why I got an extra car (Skrt)
My pool-house studio is covered up with pencil marks
And every day, it's full of jokers like a deck of cards (Hahaha)
Swear I'm so lonely, there's horns on my dome piece (Dome piece)
But I'm not the devil, I'm a motherfuckin' minotaur
Oh my God, look at how upset you are
'Cause we out here winnin', brought my dogs from out the reservoir (Hoo!)
And I'ma let 'em bark, before you ready, my set will start
We forgot our roots before and trust me, things, they fell apart
Wash myself with acid, it's because I got a denim heart
My conscience so weak, I need to split it up in seven parts (Okay)
Revis brought me out to Cali for the first time
Went to Amar'e's party, took tequila shots with Kevin Hart (Ah)
But Kevin don't remember that
I saw him at the VMAs, told a joke, he never laughed (Um)
The rap diablo, ""free your mind"" my motto
And we all gon' be good if TreeJay ever hit the lotto (We mu'fuckin' rich!)
So arigato, shit, you know I'm world-famous
And R. Kelly been told me that I'm the world's greatest (You're the world’s greatest!)
But still to fall in love is like a orgasm
'Cause you never gonna know if your girl fake it
I'm always faded, gettin' shaded in the basement
I just bought a cello, now all I do is play it (Play it)
Thank God that I made it (Made it), ask Q where Dave is (Where is he?)
He'll probably tell you that he rollin' midnights out in Vegas (Seven midnights!)
Me? I'm in my spaceship, my face is so complacent
Wear a suit to cash a check, we goin' to the banquet (Ching)
And Jimmy got the burner (Bow) but he don't wanna murder
And ClockWork is somewhere out in Sweden speaking Danish like
Hi Sven (Goddamn) isn't this your language?
That man must be a alien, I really can't explain it
Shit, it's just a little cocaine sniff *Snorts*
But the lines longer than parades is (Ah), yeah
I think it's time to give me all your praises (Praises)
So I can get this money and give all the homies raises (Raises)
My life is on these words, this is my affidavit (Wow)
And if you want a legal battle, send your ass to David (That's my lawyer)
Um, I'm half-man, half-amazin'
Probably half-God, but that don't fit my calculations (Don't make no sense)
I know the planet Earth is 'bout to explode
Kinda hope that no one save it, we only grow from anguish

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
There's snowflakes fallin' on my debit card
Swear I'm not alive, I couldn't tell you if we ever are
In this game of thrones, it is known I got them 4G LTE connection bars
No control, fuck Ken' Lamar (Fuck you, Kendrick!)
I don't vote, I never registered (Nah)
But I'm a magnet for them zeros, call me Edward Sharpe (Woo!)
I wake up feelin' dead, I need a fresher start
So me and Q put people on the label we don't remember (Ah, okay)
Smiled as I saw Jerm nerdin' out with Josh Berg
Talkin' analog gear and drinkin' Arnold Palmer (Those are good)
In the other room, watchin' C-Span with E. Dan
Layin' down a baseline, doin' drums with his free hand (How the hell does he do that?!)
When I was in first grade, I wished to be Puerto Rican
My mom took me to a barbershop to get some cornrows
I walked in, ready for them Sprewell braids
But the lady said my hair was too short though (Aw), damn
I always thought my moms was the illest for that shit (Yah)
Drivin' through the hood, she did not have a reaction (Skrt)
With a six-year-old, she kept the doors unlocked
And drove by the 5-0 like ""Fuck those cops!""
Goddamn, it just don't stop (Nah)
I know my father probably wish that I would just smoke pot
My grandma probably slap me for the drugs I got (Boy!)
I'm a crackhead but I bought her diamonds, we love rocks
A'ight

[Verse 3: Mac Miller]
Yeah, I've had the same outfit for six days straight (Gross)
And still all these bitches will get in position
'Cause I got their pussies all drippin' in paint (Woo)
Somehow, I'm makin' this music, it's just to relate to
(Damn, you're drownin'!) And I got the life raft, ain't gonna save you
Look at my reflection (Woah), I broke the mirror
It's only for protection (Okay), shit keep gettin' weirder (Weirder)
And I can't see a thing but (Woah) things never been clearer (Yeah)
Call the Mothman, it's Richard Gere (It's Richard motherfuckin' Gere!)
Yeah, this is our year
Let's get fucked up and get the fuck up outta here (Be gone)
I've kicked it with the aliens, a different stratosphere (E.T., phone home)
They lookin' down like, ""We come in peace"" (Oh, me too)
Yeah, I told Will and Bill they need to kick the habit (Put it down)
We on the same trip, we just got different baggage (That trip was brown)
Parks spilled the grape juice on all of Dylan's dad's shit (Grape juice!)
We were just some motherfuckin' kids (Woo)

*Coughs*
I think I'm gettin' sick
Been in this room
Like I was hidin' from somethin'
Look, ugh

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Posin' a question: how many been empty and holdin' aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fuck a recession, my brother my mind is my weapon
I'm lettin' it go, loaded and pointed at negative energy
Tellin' me stop, they tellin' me, ""No"" (Don't)
Your aura is somethin' you ain't even sure of
Explore the core of California, whores got more to snort up
I've had a smorgasbord of pornographic thought
That's a lot, the feelin' come after the shock
Praise me, I'd rather you not, 'cause
It's drivin' me crazy, the fact that you pay me amaze me
That's somethin' I love
You come to the club searchin' for drugs, drunk, fuckin' these sluts
God loves me, what if he does? What does it mean?
You wastin' away doin' nothin', you frontin'
Why aren't you chasin' your dreams, ugh?
We wonder 'bout life, but none of us willin' to learn
The money we earn is somethin' to burn
Why won't they give me a turn? I'll
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You mistaken, the world is cold and it's lonely, ain't it?
When them high-rollers homes in Vegas raided with some home invasion
Contaminatin' the place with plague, we just saved the day
[Refrain 1: Mac Miller]
I waste away in a room spittin' these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back, yep

[Chorus: Niki Randa]
It's a gift
(Our) Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive
It's a gift
(Our) Our time to be alive
No earthly vehicle
Can contain this drive

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Forfeitin' the war, he lays his sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store, begins to contemplate
Dealin' with death like he work in the morgue, absorbin' souls forgotten
He lost his way, starin' down that barrel, thinkin', ""Not today""
Life's so precious, Lord knows that life is so precious
Fight to the death 'til there's nobody left
And you holdin' your breath 'cause you might get infected
I'm animalistic, instinctively thinkin' of gettin' ballistic
Be specific, to those in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I'm intertwined
My trigger finger itchin', all I kill is time—*Bang*
Initial symptoms of schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can't agree on who's its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I'm shootin' lasers
'Cept I'm cool with Vader and blowin' up rooms that's full of strangers
A news anchor the youth can relate to, it's nature
You a hater? I'll deal with you later, no, thank ya
I'm just your neighbor, please don't do me no favors
Really Doe, come on, homie, we major
[Refrain 2: Mac Miller]
I waste away in this room spittin' out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands, I'm givin' it back

It was all about a dream
Turned into reality, double-cup of lean
Uh

[Verse 1]
Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packin' no bags, nothin' but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryin' to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't stayin' long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when everybody know me
Well, I made it big and everybody phony, ha
So could you pour me? I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mix in purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much?
Go 'head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

[Chorus]
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the sky, thinkin' it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standin' on my balcony
Lookin' at the street, thinkin' it could all be mine

What do you do when you think you could be a icon?
'Cause all these people get to screamin' when the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racin' to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers takin' shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my Sprite, then my night slows... down, down (Aha)
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was ""Donald Trump,"" a fuckin' hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walkin' in the club
Hey, this the 'Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you lookin' far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill ya cup up, and I'ma sip mine

Fill it up with dreams, turn 'em to reality

Uh, ign'ant-ass white kid (White kid)
But I'm still bicycling and recycling ('Cyling)
And I'm still eating gummy bear vitamins
All my bitches taking Vicodin, huffing nitrogen (Go)
Hyper than Williams' middle son
Since I was a little one, moms had to put me on the Ritalin
Made a swisher run, crack the 40 then I lit a blunt
Told Chuck I had a couple raps, so we kicked the drums
All the best rappers are usually dead
But I'm the poison that left a widow Juliet
In the studio with candles lit and Buddha heads
Coming up with all the coldest shit, take your Sudafed
Contagious, speaking while sedated
God shit, make 'em want to add a couple pages to the Bible
I ain't got nothing left in my will
'Cept, ""Throw it all in the casket, it's mine still""
Uh, I need some backpack cast raps
Took a break just to kill the game half-assed
Set some rat traps, went and took a cat nap
Woke up, threw the dead bodies in the trash bags
Act polite, but I'm nasty on the mic
Your bitch don't want my dick, then she has to be a dyke
Slap her but she like it, tell me, ""Master, feed me pipe""
I'm the scotch on the rocks, you the Appletini type

Bozo on these doppelgänger Jojos (Jojos)
Take a bitch to Soho for some Froyo
Tell her she gon' blow it: Romo
And now I'm out in Cali like Tone-Lōc (Tone-Lōc)
Young boy, but I'm chilling with some grown folk (Grown folk)
No joke, Most Dope, you just bowl smoke
How much coke you gotta sell to make a boat float?
Hit 'em, hit 'em 'til they tell me, ""No more"" (No more)
I'm a highly difficult ropes course
Pulling up to Rome on a chrome gold horse
Say ""Wassup?"" to the Pope, pull off in a Porsche
Who you kidding? Your flow's warshed
I ain't in the street but I'll grill you from the porch (Bitch)
I been had hoes, I played sports (For real)

I'm rich car service, no car keys (Yeah!)
First class flight, 'bout to land to a new bitch (Yeah, yeah)
She fuck me and swallowed every homie I came wit' (Aww, aww)

Music go with my funeral, a-hem, yeah, I said

[Verse 1]
Said I was raised inside this gritty city, ridin' through, you probably miss me
My bicycle fell, I hit the road, the mailman almost hit me
All these sins were more than shitty, I just pray the Lord forgive me
Doin' drugs is just a war with boredom but they sure to get me
My side-bitch is sort of pretty, but she got enormous titties
Know I'm worth a fortune, she just want a brand new Porsche or Bentley
Had a few abortions, unfortunately, I forced them
Lord knows I'll turn a child to an orphan when I'm tourin'
I'm more than what I think of myself, I really have to be
Sit at home and drink by myself, my thoughts harassin' me
Actually, as a matter of fact, she ain't gettin' back to me
A shame that my tragedy my masterpiece, yeah
Trapped inside these dreams of mine
Just tryna get some peace of mind, yeah
I've been trapped inside these dreams of mine
So you'll never get a piece of mind

[Verse 2]
See, we swallowed in this web of lies, never try to exercise
You used to be a fantasy but now I guess it's televised
I heard the legends never die, oh, this lonely hell of mine
There never was a better time to better myself
Forever I melt and float away like waves in the ocean
Starin' inside of Heaven's eyes, the gates will never open
I'm smokin' on this field of hope, waitin' 'til my deal gets closed
I keep gettin' hotter but all I seem to feel is cold
Twenty-two don't feel so old, but I think I'm eighty-two
You mean to tell me God took seven days and all he made was you?
I'm out here with the kangaroos, makin' danger, break the rules
Celebrate my date of birth with acid, get the days confused
Happiness I take from you, searchin' for the naked truth
I'm not awake, I'm in a lake, I'll swim away with you
Bitch, check out the butterfly
If you the truth, then what the fuck am I?
Yeah

I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even

Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause

Often with the bullshit, and, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us

My bitch can tell that I'm addicted to pussy, she lookin' past it
The smile that she fakin' is tragic, hate lookin' at it
That magic I try to grasp it, she's had it with the dramatics
Fantasize of love, so classic
Attracted to what she got up in her attic, can we mind fuck?
Do I lie when I look inside her eyes? Hush, don't say a word
I know I make you hurt, sorry is my favorite word
I don't deserve your trust, but can we make it work?
I hate to end the story, can we wait until the morning to decide on it?
Spend this time pretendin' it was that first summer
We was pure lovers
She was used to bein' hurt, I took that curse from her
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for, you wish that I would call more
You're sick of seein' condoms in my sock drawer
Love turns to war so quickly, I envisioned us married and fifty
Couple of kids that we drop off at little league
I'm addicted to you, you only want the best, I need to listen to you

Don't know what I gotta do, just love you so much
That it hurts

Yeah, um
And I see you fallin' victim to the thirst
All the sins you committed, you could prolly use a couple minutes in church
But, for what it's worth, I think you're perfect
There's an angel hidin' underneath your surface
Yeah, the woman of my dreams, I'm lookin' at her sleep
The pussy right in front of me, I shouldn't be so weak
What did I do to deserve a love like this?
You see her shinin'? That's my sunlight, bitch
I'm sick of fightin', that smile is so invitin'
I see you every time I'm writin'
I'm losin' to all my vices, they kickin' my ass
I hold on to this feelin', I wish it would last
Don't wanna lose you for some evil I did in the past
You knew I fucked that bitch and you didn't react?
Girl, it's me and you, how simple is that?
You gave me all your love, now I'm givin' it back
But I know that
[Chorus 2]
Girl, you the worst, yeah
You know that you the worst
But I'm somethin' you can't lose, if you just told me the truth
That'd be a first, but

Well, my crew too live, but I ain't Uncle Luke
And I ain't no hipster, but girl, I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome (Woo,) to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Lookin' out my monocle
I'm dodgin' obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I'm heroin 'cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fuckin' shiny, word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion, ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day, these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is somethin' these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion, everybody is second-string
No need to testify (Testify,) for the best is I (Best is I)
And anybody in my way gon' be left to die

I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)

I got my own stickers now, so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes, still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool, you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market, where we kickin' out the garbage
Sick bars, I’ve been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just 'bout who the hardest
On my own, too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I’m the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I’m just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely, girl, I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say? I suggest you hold it in, bitch

I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back (Back)

Rapper feuds are sad if you would battle for a stack or two

Indefinite boundaries show you the end of it
Don't forget, you infested in nesting crevices
Allowin' birds to fall to their death before they even fly (Brr-r!)

And I'ma run it, bloodhound with my nose (My nose)
To the money, ain't fuckin' with these hoes (Never that)
Gettin' ducats 'til I die, while my foes (My foes)
Busy runnin', fuck it, marijuana smoke in my stomach (Um)

Yeah, no fucks when I go nuts
Give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa
Yeah

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I give no fucks when I go nuts
'Cause I smoke dust, overdosed on the sofa, dead
Woke up from a coma
Poured up with a soda, smoked, went back to bed
Never thought I'd be such a loner
I tell my bitch that I fuckin' own her
My neighbor's daughter just got a dog
I'ma run it over, I'm a fuckin' soldier
So cold, bruh, fuck pneumonia
All my bitches got love for Sosa
I just wanna fuck Rosa Acosta
Then disappear in Southern California
Strung out 'til the night, I'm chillin'
Everybody worried that the lights might kill 'em
Uh, feel ya sight slippin'
Long lines of those white women
I'm with the homies, bump Counting Crows
Just went through a half ounce of coke
Blood pourin' all out my nose
Don't tell my mom I got a drug problem
I'm fuckin' high-ly publicized
When the sun go down, I come alive
'Cause the guns go off in the summertime
The guns go off in the summertime, blaow
[Chorus: Mac Miller]
This another motherfuckin' rap song
Broke and crazy, rich and famous doesn't last long
Spent all my cash on a broken dream
Went from weed and liquor to the coke and lean
All-all-all I got's this mansion and this potpourri
But don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?
Don't-don't-don't I look so handsome in these Polo jeans?

[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
I blow a spliff before the ink dries on the paper
And lately, I don't like shit, I been inside on the daily
Gettin' wasted as the time that I'm spendin' high and sedated
I'm puttin' five in his face, because we don't buy into bullshit
As soon as it's flashin' lights then it's kush to hide in the bushes
I do this shit out of spite 'cause there's niggas that overlooked me
Forever, I'm more content with dark and stormier weather
Flip the fuckin' cross on your rosary, we supposed to be better
But here's a toast to your efforts
And don't approach me with nothin' that isn't money or breakfast
I'm close to chokin' a pussy, pussy
Sweaty man, you best had bet your bottom dollar on him
With a couple niggas, weighin' sess like it's a lot of options
Fifteen on me for soda and swishers
And who's the shit, a bag of chips and a colon decleanser?
I'm over bitches tryna act like I owe 'em a picture
Rather introduce these hoes to Vince who could show you a pistol
Listen, S.T. was the older initials
Bend rap game tighter than boa constrictors
Rollin' stone like a boulder ravin', I'm so impatient and goin' dumb
As disclosin' my fuckin' home location to total strangers
No love in my heart for coppers, blood from my lungs on the sink
Cashin' out off the garments, the artist, fuck what you think
The sky'll turn black and the carrions could pick
At my flesh when I rest, tell 'em bury me adrift

I might know some dyke hoes who can fight though (Yeah!)
Walkin' on a tight rope, underneath a microscope
But close-up we all just molecules and isotopes (That's very deep)

Deadly aim, self-contained, superstar, they yell the name
Blood diamonds, finna go to hell for my chain

I'm too high, you can't reach me with the cell phone
No goodbyes, no hellos
You don't want this life I live, you'd rather had a wife and kid
Shootin' dice with Jesus Christ, put twenty on the midnight
To everyone who sell me drugs:
Don't mix it with that bullshit, I'm hopin' not to join the 27 Club
Just want the coke-dealer house with the velvet rug
Fuck the world, there's no one else but us (Whoa)

But kickin' bitches out my crib, somebody tell 'em go home, oh, no
I was in the crib with my different shit
Simple livin', I'm a hypocrite 'cause I'm filthy rich and got businesses
Been had wifey, had mistresses
Been tryna tell you what my vision is, but y'all still ain't listenin'
The war ain't winnin', it's just beginnin'
And I've been 'bout Sparta like Michigan, I got stats
They got opinions, I got facts
LeBron left home, but he came back
This what raised me, made me rap

'Stead of all of this weight that we have to carry
Would you be able to breathe?
And if you could just find where that comfort resides
No distraction or movement that fucks wit' your mind
Would you let them see?
While beneath the ocean, I met with the captain
Who sank to the floor on his ship
All of his passengers escaped to safety
But he was not done with his trip
He looked up and smiled, asked me, ""How do you do?''
I told him, ""I'm losin' my grip""
He told me, ''Son, if you want to hold onto yourself
Then let yourself slip''

But march on the heart of this land, oh-oh
Why don't you turn around and go home?
They invade your minds and then fill them with nonsense
These things that a man doesn't need
Take out the love and the passion and hope
And they fill it with nothing but greed
While floating through galaxies, they said I couldn't
I noticed how sad one can get
'Cause the ignorant mind is so peaceful, I find
I can't understand nothin' no more

[Chorus]
If I jump, let me fall (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh
If I jump, let me fall, oh
Fall
Oh, it feels good to fall

Bad side piece with the pertinent flavor (Woo)
Muh'fuckers never loved us
Comin' for your money, muh'fucker don't trust us (Nah)

'Cause I fade to black, I gets down like a plane attack
You muh'fuckers just made me laugh
Ha ha, God damnit, this ain’t a drill, do not panic
Let me see how loud you scream (Argh!)
I'm off the map, muh'fuckas start lookin'
But they're never gonna see where I be
She only speak French
Said ""Bitch look, don't try and speak around me""
And I don't sleep at all
If you on that bullshit, I ain't gonna be involved
Shit, shit, shit
I could make a million puttin' my lyrics on a tee (Woah)
Fearless, Jet Li, fourth quarter, Gretzky
Take your bitch, Joe Pesci, don't test me
Don't flex if you ain't got shit on me
And, you ain't got shit on me, come get it

[Verse 1]
You hide your skin like ya shy or did somethin' wrong
You stylish when you got nothin' on, yeah
And all I do is make these fuckin' songs
So, finally, I made a fuckin' song
And now she comin' closer
Up she goes, she wanna jump my bones
You want it, don't ya?
I was a soldier, now I'm comin' home, the war is over
Kick down the door, I hold your bends, you never break
You need to smell your sweet aroma
See, I knows you smell like cinnamon, kissin' your lips
I lick my fingertips and get your clitoris in the mix
My dick on business trips
My tongue twistin' is ticklin' just a little bit
I'm swimmin' inside of your skin like a river
In the Caribbean

[Bridge]
It's okay that you like it, babe (I like it, baby)
And it's alright that you misbehave
It's okay to be this way (This way)
To live this way, baby, baby (Ooh, baby)
Chillin' with the AC

You and me, super freaks, here we are

Said I'm too divine, I'm too divine, yeah; too divine
Who am I? Well; I'm Mr. Superfly
I'm Mr. Ooh-He-Blew-Your-Mind, hot as June, July
I wanna make your waterfall
Girl, you my paintin', you my art installation
Gonna fuck you, put you on the wall
All I wanna do is show you off, I want to put you on
Why would I ever blow you off?
Right now, let's go get lost
Jet, I've been way too high for way too long
I'm so exhausted
Whether that's your mind or line, we still get crossed
First your name is gone
Never understand until you have to stand alone
Can I have a hand to hold?
A Band-Aid for my damaged soul, I paint the planet gold
Swear I'm Michelangelo, I don't understand these hoes
They didn't want a man when it was, ""Man, I'm broke""
And now they know me and what I don't need
You gon' see it's gon' be what's gon' be

Take your time, when talkin' to a nigga I don't waste none
Knock you off your feet and then I flee before the jakes come
Sick of hearin' cases from these niggas who ain't face none
But I'ma be the nigga that they feelin' when the day come
Thirsty for the pay, young niggas led astray
Stray bullet hit my brother in his ma'fuckin' face
What's fate when a person don't deserve what he get?
Shootin' reckless at the father, almost murdered the kid
Or is it karma for the shit that both the parents had did?
Ain't embarrassed, where I'm livin' we get merit for kills
From a family of niggas that was veteran skilled
Voted heartless 'cause my momma made me part of the guild
Deals made, sellin' thrills paid the bills at the crib
Drag him down by the river, he'll be missin' for years
And them funerals was usual, ain't sheddin' no tears
Knew the fallen had it better off than most of us did
'Cause shit, Heaven knows, Heaven's gates prolly closed
And these hoes in a race for the gold
We was raised on that fork in the road
No food on our plate, just the meals that we stole

I spit that prayer hand emoji, that shit that injured Kobe
The holiest of holy, Nick Nolte in some Oakley's
That's a flex though, cover up the issues that I kept close
Sober, I can't deal, I'm in the corner with my head low
Runnin' from my shadow, never ending chase
Ease the pain and the battle that's within me
Sniff the same shit that got Whitney, the high heel depression
My temple feel the metal comin' out the Smith & Wesson, bang
Say a prayer, leave my brains on a tile floor
My bitch hate me, always tell me I should smile more
Off them drugs that hit you in your spinal cord
This the shit I need to keep the climate warm
Wish I could get high, space migration
Pretend I could just fly to great vibrations
The magazines need a quote
When I'm gone, sorry, I don't leave a note, yo

So I've been lookin' in the mirror and it still don't make no sense
I'm askin', ""What am I supposed to do?""
Done so much in my short lifetime, but I haven't done shit
I done flew around the whole world
First I shook a million hands, then I took a million pictures
But I'm a hostage in my own world
Yeah, my thoughts my own enemy, got no time for these bitches
I got too much on my damn mind
So if I add some more stress, I just don't see how I'ma cope
I think they underestimate the grind
I do to bring this dough, and I'm only 20 years old
I wonder why I sip this devil juice, 'cause it feel incredible

I hope this feelin' last for fuckin' ever
I don't wanna come back down, let me stay above the ground
I hope I do what I was meant to do
'Cause I've been searchin' for that answer, I just hope I get it now
Please, let me find euphoria
When you up above the clouds, like, ""Who gon' touch me now?""
And do we ever get to know the truth?
'Cause everybody seems to have it, but to me it seems they lack it
Now I'm rollin' and I'm sippin' lean
Sometimes I catch a buzz just to help me picture love
Drinkin' liquor and I'm smokin' weed
And you don't ever do too much if you could never do enough
Wonder why it's me instead of you, I'll be there to rescue you

And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined

And every night I get advice, 'cause life is way too complex (Yep)

But can't you see? This angel speaks
She's sayin' the place is safe for me
I told her, ""Wait for me,"" the make-believer normally disguise
Transform before your eyes and glorifies euphoric highs
The morning rises and I'm fast asleep
Somewhere off in the master suite
Havin' dreams of Latin queens and nasty freaks
My mind, it wanders to places yonder and even farther
When I'm sleep walkin', I'm Stephen Jobs or I'm Peter Parker
A genius author, a Jesus preachin' just to feed his daughter
The weed to spark up, yeah, he's a goner, fuck these prima-donnas (Woah)

Is what I do important in the grand scheme of things?

As you hypothesize on how to monetize and take advantage of
All the time we fall behind, get lost in this Aquarium (Gone)
America, the standard of vanity when the camera's up
We become celebrities, distract from the hysteria
Confessions that I have, the curiosity about life and death
Most of us will never understand it, we just like the quest
Read about the meanings of dreaming and all its messages
Sedatives that take me to God, witness his fetishes (Uh-huh)
We all in search for substance (Substance)
That drugs your pain and numbness (Numbness)
Circumstances advancin' the second chance for this beloved
I wish I could tell you that I didn't see this comin' (Comin')
But I'm ready for it all to end, die before tomorrow's trend (Not again)
Your life, it all depends on dollars spent and knowledge gained
Darkness on the brain, lost inside, forgotten days (Forgotten days)
Life, it works in such mysterious ways (Ways)
All these years that I pray, hope you hear what I say, ayy

See the world as simple, but complex in the design
I spent some time just thinkin'
Where did that get me? High, more drinkin'
Now my head empty, so can it last a couple minutes more?
Pain a funny thing when you can't figure out the source
Bear witness while I'm checkin' bitches off my hit list
Try to understand the fuckin' message I encrypted
Ancient, halucinatin' visions of utopia
Until I figure out that the perfect world a lonely one
Never hold my tongue, vocal as a loaded gun
And I'ma shoot somebody in the face if they too slow to run

But I'm the coldest one, this is pandemonium

Might head to Budapest just to get a Gucci vest
Hop into a jet, get some rest to diffuse the stress (Uh)
See, this is what I do the best
Nothin' that you got except the bullet gettin' through my chest
Save hard, a Braveheart, a warrior
I take part to stay far from coroners
I heard some corny words said about my music though
Talkin' all that shit, sound exactly like a groupie ho
Most Dope, got you hooked, yellin', ""Rufio""
First you lose your mind, then you lose your soul
So what you talkin' about? Thinkin' you out of options

To Glocks and the Stock Exchange
Now watch the price of life on the block drop, insane
You can't stop this reign, don't name-drop in vain
Inhale toxic flames from tropic strains, it's awkward, strange
Last week he was nothin', boxers stain
Now everybody love him and chicks offer top for fame
To the top I aim, testin' waters, so I've been afloat
No deal but flow so real, he been in the scopes
Sun got shine, now they say he shady, but he never dippin' though
Still facin' L's, you would think a nigga wins was low
What you think I'm in this for?
Won't stop 'til the nigga who invented dope
End the flow or behind bars, droppin' prison soap
Beggin' for forgiveness, but it's business though

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Young sire, slap the fuck out Jon Cryer
Rough rider, raw bust inside a vagina like I want kids
My head continues to be haunted
I burn a city down while I'm unconscious
Maybe go and take some Quaaludes, conversate with Jesús
Batting practice with the motherfuckin' ghost of Babe Ruth
Do as a saint do, turn painful to graceful
The devil on my trails, I'm tryna find the Holy Grail
*Coughs* Right there
And if Mars is the farthest that man has set his target
Then I don't know why I even started
I'm sick of bein' too nice to people who don't do shit but consume light
Told myself, ""Fuck the world, kid, just do what you like
Go and have a food fight, start yourself a new life
You're too bright to be inside a bunch of mediocrity
But all those big words ain't gon' get you paid
And those abstract ideas for sure won't get you laid
You got it made in that mad house
What the fuck you got to be sad 'bout? Go 'head and rap now
Do what you do best
I mean, that's what you do best
Matter fact, motherfucker, you a suit vest, you need to buy a new dress
I heard you and your girl live in a duplex
I'ma put her ass in a suplex, the sun east, the moon west
If you got a clue, what does a clue get? Nothin'""
[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
My milk and honey, my chérie-chérie amore
My Cinderella in her carriage by the doorway
Her ruby slipper made the wizard send the scarecrow
And the lion through the forest
To the Wicked Witch's fortress where she scorched them in the foreplay
Remember that? He said he'd fight the box to see the wizard
When he was visited by Dorothy who came here on a blizzard
Now the whole world's in color, still
How Auntie Em was next of kin but not her mother, real
Her face was careworn
I suspect she migrated to Kansas up from Dearborn
And had beef with Mrs. Gulch since the very beginnin' of year one
Mr. Candyman, the parables parabolic
The poetry's like the poems and psalms of Ecclesiastes
Lightnin' should strike the stone and then Moses should make a tablet
The Judge will bang the wood up in parliament with the mallet
And yell, ""Hear, hear,"" finally some order to this rap shit
Finally some sort of water to soil these cracked lips
I keep my shit crispy and elegant
So miss me with the irrelevant, the godbody is heaven-sent
The hard-body is reverence, since the son of Byford
Brother of Fal, every rhyme's halal
Every line is kosher, livin' la vida loca
Shout out to Tony Toca, we ballin' like we suppose to...25Embed"

Whew, that drip
Yeah, okay

[Verse 1]
Writin' on writer's block, haven't slept in days
They wanna put me in the psycho watch, everyone's afraid
Of what I do inside my studio, worried I'ma lose control
They rufflin' my feathers and they shufflin' the Yu-Gi-Oh!
Execution flow, at your neck like new cologne
Uno, dos, bitch, I'm in your head like Freddy Krueger though
My brain fried, always chasin' the same high
I'm too fucked up to function, do nothin' but waste time
Woke up annihilated, lyin' on the pavement
Covered in items I regurgitated under a fire escape
And I know that it's Friday, 'cause every Friday they have a parade
In-front of city hall, hear 'em celebrate, they havin' a ball
My pupils dilated, highly dehydrated, I'm lost inside a giant matrix
Isolate myself from eyes I find contagious
Jump above the comedown
I'm strung out, noddin' off inside the dugout
[Chorus]
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? Tell me what you made of
What are you afraid of? It's just a little angel dust

La-da-da-da, la-da-da (Just a little angel dust)

La-da-da-da, ayy (It's just a little angel dust)

[Verse 2]
Yeah
I'm playin' hot potato on a Winnebago
The chips are stale, they taste okay though when they dipped in queso
And what's an angel with a missin' halo?
She would drop outta school to take a trip to DayGlow
Found a twenty layin' by the sewer rats
You know little Stuart hasn't been in any movies lately
He's spent his paychecks on cocaine and latex
His agent workin' hard to try and book him a commercial
What I do should not concern you, do this 'til I turn blue
Not Eric Sermon, I'm more Merlin, curses turn 'em into bird food
Hurry to make the first move, I'm walkin' like Herschel
And now we at the end of verse two, oh

[Chorus]
Don't be scared, just come with me, yeah
Feels so good to feel this free
What are you afraid of? (Woo!) Tell me what you made of (Yeah)

Call you up to tell you I ain't comin' home tonight
Say you wanna leave me, it's just talkin', but I know you might
Now get along, I get along, I go
You sing along to every song that you know
You play your part, I'm playin' mine
You breakin' hearts, ain't breakin' mine
Since growin' old is takin' time, I'm actin' like I'm eight or nine
Tryin' to move on, talkin' to my old friends
See me, say what up and I'm actin' like I don't know them
Causin' so much problems, why you doin' that, doin' that?
Rippin' people's hearts out, you too cute for that, cute for that
I been on the same shit (Same shit)
We run into each other and it's like we don't even speak the same language (Language)
I guess people always goin' through changes (Changes)

Wishin' that you knew that, you could have these shoes back

I can't be seen again with you and none of your friends
It's so hard to pretend that it's like it was way back when
I thought you used to be the one, I guess you don't have time
'Cause all you do is grind and it's got me losin' my mind
You just don't, don't, don't love me like you used to

Bury me in Allegheny County, it's the
The most hated, so faded that I'm bow-legged
Don't bathe, gross gang, smell like old Lo Mein, shit
The flow dangerous, make you wanna do the wave
Throw your bitch right off your lap and start a standing ovation
The most strangest, master of the ceremonies
A fifth of Stoli then it’s only Cher and Moby karaoke
My bitch a shooter, call her Annie Oakley
Get you for a pair of Kobe's, just got out on probation
And no famous friends for me, just old faces
I only go places wasted like I'm Joe Namath
Not a king, I'm no David, music, I'm a crackhead
No hobbies and recreation, don't even know my address
Self-medicate, self-education
Rick Rubin showed me transcendental meditation

Let us have a grand finale
The world will be just fine without me

Slow it down, we goin' out with a bang
Are you ready for the fireworks?
It was a silent night 'til the fireworks

[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay, I
I fear nothin' on this odyssey of dark roads
God lives in my dog's soul, the devil in his dog bowl
We are the prophets, Jesus was a poor sport
He booted Nostradamus, turned water into wine
But he loved the gin and tonic, had skeletons in his closet
Even God will one day be forgotten
And recently I been feelin', I been feelin' like
It'd be really nice to get to sit with Mickey Weiss
Shoot the shit 'bout life, he'd be pissed I'm sniffin' white
Never got to see me grow up, how long it take to live a life?
I'm a bit surprised that I'm even still alive
Mixin' uppers and downers practically suicide
My old Jewish mind, REMember music, you'll be fine
And I make my own beats now, if you behind
Hallucination's how I use my mind
Who am I?

Karma is a bitch and that bitch don't love ya, yeah
We was in the attic, you could smell the weed
Bitches gettin' naked, we was selling E
Bitches kissin' bitches just like Ellen D (Ellen D)
In the kitchen whippin' biscuits, givin' generously (Thank you)
I thank the Lord I made it out, no STD (Word)
Lost a few too many brain cells, I'm special needs, yeah

Ladies and gentlemen in attendance, good morning

And I want you to know
It ain't about complaining, it's about maintaining

Don't ever become content because you will repent

Clarity...
Clarity...

[Verse 1]
Clarity
Figure all this out, I ain't gonna take a charity
Marry me
Wish everyone could shake and play the tambourine
Perfect
I know I love you, I ain't tryna let those words slip
Pure bliss
I knew that we would stay together, we in cursive

[Verse 2]
Infatuation
When every single move you make is fascinatin'
Gravitatin'
Towards anything that gives a sense of happiness
Activist, love activist
Sendin' my love for girls who got some cuts at their wrists
Hope you found what you lookin' for
I hope you find what you lookin' for
[Chorus]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
I'ma be waitin' for that

[Verse 3]
Misery
You represent love, you the epitome
So wish for me
I'll come out of nowhere—your epiphany
Disconnect
From everybody who don't understand my vision yet
In a jet
Is where my mind is, so I light another cigarette to calm me down

[Verse 4]
So calm me down
Everybody who can save me now is not around
Chopper down
Busy today, but can you tell me how tomorrow sounds?
In between
Purgatory ain't as bad as it would seem to be
Live a dream
That's so cliché, but I can tell you what it means to me
[Chorus]
You take away the pain and I thank you for that
If I ever get the chance, bet I'm payin' you back
I'ma be waitin' for that
Said, I'ma be waitin' for that

I feel like a million bucks
But my money don't really feel like I do
And from the ground, I built my own damn buzz
People was amazed I was still in high school
But now I'm out, and money what I'm 'bout
Tryna get so much that I can't keep count
New kicks give me cushion like whoopie
Keep a smile like an Eat'n Park cookie
Everything good, I'm white boy awesome
Up all night, Johnny Carson
I ain't got a Benz, no, just a Honda
But tryna get my money like an Anaconda
Real, real long, cross the country
Smoke joints in the whip, no cop can bust me
Drive into the stage, they applaud and scream
All them pretty little girls come and flock with me
Yeah, I rock the beat

If you got weed, you can come fly with me
I don't take pity on them silly little hoes
Milli Vanilli but this is really how it goes
Mouth my words, don't say shit
Shh, shut up, bitch, and ride this dick
I'm just playing, let's have a ball
All we need is some weed, hoes and alcohol, hey
Don't forget it when I'm wreckin' the etiquette for the hell of it
Smellin' it when the L is lit, I'm flyer than a pelican
Young fresh, but I'm so damn intelligent
Girls givin' brains 'cause I'm acting like a gentleman
In deeper than the water Michael Phelps was in
Finna have a party, baby, you can tell your friends
We the type, lookin' right, still settin' trends

Hey, Kool-Aid and frozen pizza
It's a work of art, I ain't talking Mona Lisa
Dream of rocking crowds, see me filling up arenas
This weed got me laughing like a damn hyena
Yeah, I live a life pretty similar to yours
Used to go to school, hang with friends and play sports
Every single summer taking trips to the shore
And that was all gravy but I knew I wanted more
Ain't ever seen a young rapper like moi
Can't believe they eyes, swear it's just a mirage
Still got my training wheels in the garage
But I ain't gonna need those, I'ma go hard (Go hard)
So far I've done pretty well for myself
Couple trophies on the shelf, so what else
Could I want that I don't have yet?
Well, a little more cash and my own fast jet
So I can go anywhere, (Anywhere) anywhere (Anywhere)
Cali for the kush, 'cause boy I know there's plenty there
'Bout to be in music stores everywhere, but not yet
They can't understand my concept
I've been climbing up the great wall, haven't had a fall yet
These blogs gotta know I'm on next
Clean conscience, good Samaritan
Companies send me clothes so I'm wearing them
If you didn't know, well, I'm from the 'Burgh
Everything I drop recorded by Big Jerm
I smoke herb, then I make music
I don't even talk about it, boy, I just do it
Everybody got their own opinion, the reasons why they feeling him
You must admit he's killing 'em, running off adrenaline
Waiting for the game to wanna let him in, so open up
The boy a barrel of a smoking gun
Whether I'm old or young, the chosen one
I got a hundred billion flows to come
I hope you know the lyrics to every single song
So when I'm at a show everyone can sing along
My weed bag empty, bottle at its last drop
I'm feeling like this could be my last shot
But many more songs to make, cousin
So why the fuck you bugging? Haha

Uh, figured out I ain't gonna go to college, Lee Corso
Fuckin' girls, but I never kept the door closed
Want you all to hear the way I put it in her torso
I ain't normal, I'm clinically insane
I guess it's the result of all the drugs that enterin' my brain
All of a sudden, every legend keep on mentionin' my name
All that does is show me that my life will never be the same
Police tryna figure out how to get me locked up
I tell those cops, ""Suck dog nuts,"" haha

Purpose is for people in the plural
Form never formal, an art form, not a mural
Work four bars that are tighter than your cornrows
See a girl that's lookin' horny in the fourth row
Ha, I just put it in her mouth, ortho-
Dontist, manipulatin' phonics, put 'em into sonnets

Hypothetically of dope, I kick incredibly
Potentially could be the remedy for happiness without the ecstasy
No methamphetamines, hot, a hundred-ten degrees
Visually stunnin', gotta see it on the LED
When I was seventeen, I thought I had it figured out
Now I see what it's about, went in down a different route
It's crucial, three new schools, life with a spoonful
Of sugar, yeah, I need my medicine
Fuckin' Mary Poppins, gotta treat her like the president
Represent all these fuckin' people that I never met

Seven years old, saw my first porno
Damn, that fucked me up
At ten, I bust my first nut on this older ho gut, but so what?
Let's recap, the Earth spinnin' too rapid
I'm livin' too fast, sinning's a habit
I can't hack, fornicate, act this rabid
One bean short of an acid tablet
The security guard sparks my cigarette
The old head go 'head, cop me a brew
Sometimes them Koreans be cool
These shades make me look twenty-two
They say, ""You'll learn when you get older""
I just say that that ain't true
That just mean when you was younger
You ain't get turnt up like us, fool
Just got L's so I'm ridin' high, still in high school but I do
Everything I will do, when I'm twenty-five, no lie (Uh)

I was young with ambition, fucked around with these hoes (Hoes)
Never needed permission, went and lived the life that I chose (Chose)
Premonition-type visions, you see the world as it goes (Goes)
Tell 'em all what they missin', while I watch it as it unfolds
I'm dodgin' my death, confident kid
I was tryna grow up with the best (Oh, oh)

Found myself noddin' off always on test-day

Woulda got one of them hoes from ""The Bachelor""
Could've been smart, could've been a doctor
Life full of drama, little soap opera
Fallin' in love, lucky that I caught ya
Almost got her knocked up, would've been a father
All about energy, make good memories
I'm the fuckin' Dalai Lama (Ooh!)
Only eighteen but I had my own business
Then I got fame like, ""What the fuck is this?""
Whole bunch of cameras, fake-ass bitches (Yeah, yeah)
Everybody around wanna treat me all different
Oh, I'm cool, 'cause I got money? (All this money)
Back in high school, none of these hoes was tryna fuck me (Fuck me)

Sometimes my thoughts start scarin' me
You a parody, hilarity, that funny shit's for the parakeets

Somethin' brand new, wonder what it might be
You party off them drugs, movin' at a nice speed

If you eighteen years and older
Eighteen years and older

I wanna rule the world, take care of my family
And take care of my girl, plant a couple seeds

People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have the money to spend
To buy Patrón for you and all your friends (Hey)
Baby, I be on my grind, rain, sleet, snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
'Cause we tryin' get high (Get high), get high (Get high), get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give 'em what they need
Just wakin' up, then gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup left in my bottle, damn
Well, it's okay
I top it off with scrambled eggs, ayy
Gotta work with what you got, ayy (What?)
Gotta work with what you got

Can you stay a while?

'Cause, girl, I'm feelin' lazy
And I'm tryna hang around

Ain't tryna get out of my bed 'til noon
Neighbors smell the perfume, smoke in my room
And I got the door closed, can't be sure, though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euros
Get the herb rolled, let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escape the world, escape the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
'Cause we gon' handle that later, we gon' handle that later
Right now, let's get this paper and smile for all them haters
Ayy, cream cheese and a bagel
Have a glass of milk and an Eggo
I'm rockin' PJs and no shirt
I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Enjoy the best things in your life
'Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice (Twice)
They say you waste time asleep, but I'm just tryin' to dream

Do you know that every mohawk competitor has electrocardiogram, blood and urine tests, every forty-eight hours to see if there's any change in his physical condition? Do you know that they use the most sophisticated training methods from the Soviet Union, East and West Germany and the newest Olympic power, Trinidad & Tobago? But it doesn't matter!

Even if we play so far over our heads that our noses bleed for a week to ten days, even if God in Heaven above comes down and points his hand at our side of the field, even if every man, woman, and child held hands together and prayed for us to win, it just wouldn't matter!

Hold up, pause. Always over the quota

Once they start to realize that I'm actually crazy

Never that, the smile's so gone, so bring the coke on
I'm higher than Voltron, with a bunch of gold on
Caucasians still love me like my name was Michael Bolton
Hold on, do you fuckin' dirty like the soap gone
Froze on, it's bone chillin', colder than the Pope's secrets
Older than Capone's demons, comin' from a place where there was no Jesus
Walkin' bo-hemoth, I increase the feces
'Cause shit real, fly into your windshield and get killed
Buggin' out, had it all, I'm nothin' now
I just gave it away
Fuck a label, Cain and Abel, put a name to a face

Word to Heavy D, and rest in peace to all that come and pass

Man, my mind is an emporium of cute naked hoes
My brother one of the only ones I can confide in
It ain't no water in the pool, go 'head and dive in (Dive in)
I toot my horn, I blow my bugle, I recycle
I say ""free beluga whales"" on YouTube, what do you do?

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Okay
The pussy like trouble 'cause I'm in it often
A drug habit like Philip Hoffman will probably put me in a coffin
But down the slope in my toboggan
Three day delirium, gettin' weirder than Austin
Now it's seven in the morning, this rapper life is so boring
Still at it, the drug absorbent, endorphin addict, yeah
The evil follow me, I got a devil magnet
I know a bitch who'll let you fuck her for Coachella passes

[Verse 3: Sir Michael Rocks]
Oh, so pompous, the ambiance
You remind me of the lobby of the Mondrian
I saw you meditatin', get your Gandhi on
If she got that stank puss, then I won't be long
[Verse 4: Mac Miller]
Never lose your mind 'cause insanity is brutal
Life is just like college, all you have's your noodle

[Verse 7: Sir Michael Rocks]
Ehh, coming off the high, listening to Jamiroquai
Why we go through hell when we tryna get to paradise?
It's like we ain't scared of death but we scared of life
It's like we shootin' for the stars but we scared of heights

[Verse 8: Mac Miller]
I'm in-doors, pair of gym shorts, with the Sith Lord
We might go bowling later, maybe play Connect 4
Get high, fuck her with the Tech Deck
Callin’ local middle schools and send in some death threats

Hey look
When I tell you this, I mean this seriously, from the bottom of my heart
I need the briefcase in 15 minutes
Or everybody's finished

[Chorus]
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

[Verse]
Get the fuck out of my car, this ain't a taxi
They love to see me lonely, hate to see me happy
Call me what you want, she call me ""daddy""
Got a knack for gettin' nasty, every day we keepin' tally, yeah
Ooh, it's true I want it badly
Hit the zoom, I be movin' like a athlete
(Now concentrate) No reason to be that upset
I'm busy trippin' 'bout some shit that still ain't even happen yet
I keep it honest as honesty gets
Don't know why I'm always talkin' if I'm not makin' sense
I've spent my life livin' with a lot of regrets
You throw me off my high horse, I'd probably fall to my death
(Bad behavior) It's obvious you're not on your best
I might just pull your card if it's on top of the deck
Give me, give me what I need and then I'm onto the next
That's what we callin' cause and effect
[Chorus]
Yeah, why don't you wake up from your bad dreams?
When's the last time you took a little time for yourself?
There's no reason to be so down
Rather fly around like there's no ground
And I, I bet you wish you hadn't ate
'Cause carrying this weight'll break your glass knees
Yeah, don't need no chauffeur, fuck the backseat
No, I stay behind the wheel and never half-speed

Yeah
And I can't feel my legs, I'm a paraplegic
Lord, I want a fair one with my demons
Karen Meyers became married to Jesus
Born dead, they had to dig up my fetus
And now the devil want to tear me to pieces
I'm a diagnosed insomniac
An astronaut who blastin' off into the star galactic
On top of Saturn, fox-trottin' with velociraptors
The dino-aliens invaded Earth, so they could feed on hypochondriacs
Prepared for the rapture, closet hillbilly
Threw the spinners on the tractor, I listen to Uncle Kracker, but
That's white America for you, we all that matters
I'm walkin' backwards, shadowboxin' with karate masters
It's more to rap, we sell the royal crack at Castle Rock
A bad apple like an unemployed Macintosh
We lost Jobs, now they brainwashed with dot com
It's only so long until we surrender the free world to Hong Kong

[Chorus]
And sinners stay still, but the merry go round
And round
It all just keeps spinnin'
Gotta keep swimmin' (Keep swimmin'), yeah (Keep swimmin')
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Yeah, yeah)
[Verse 2]
I got a double-sided silver dollar
Larry Fish here from midget league, beginner slaughter
I'm not drownin', I'm wadin' in the water
Killin' off these monsters ever since I was a Sabra
I got horses on my PJ's
Shout to Spitta, jet life, I fit the Porsches on the PJ's
On stage, sendin' dark forces to my DJ
The birdies on tour like PGA, Davis Love III
Pittsburgh warrior, bullets in my cornea
In exelsis Deo, ayo, this is Gloria
(Ave) Av—(Maria)—Ave Maria
I'm gettin' bread, yeast rise on Easter, money is God (God)
Black bitches with jungle fever, I love to be on
You on the B-Team, I fuck with Solange
All my life they said I doesn't belong
So I'm chillin', growin' drugs on my lawn

[Chorus]
Sinners stay still, but the merry go round
And round
It all just keeps spinnin'
Gotta keep swimmin' (Keep swimmin'), yeah (Keep swimmin')
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go round)
Eat, drink and let the merry go round (Go r—)
[Outro]
Yeah
What? What? What?
Have you found a way out?
Have you found a way out? Yeah
A vacation in Slovakia, celebratin' Mardi Gras
Eatin' baklava and lobster claw at the Ramada
With a Mafia of immigrants
Finna take 'em on a pilgrimage
Have you found a way out?25Embed"

Bum-ba-da-bum-bum (Yeah)
Yeah (Yeah)
Okay

[Verse 1]
There's a birthday party happenin' upstairs (Where?)
And it's all for me, who the fuck cares? (Fuck it)
They won't notice if I never go and show my face (Face)
They just lookin' for a reason they can celebrate (That's okay)
I hate to waste the vanilla cake that they made for me (Tasty)
I tell the same stories, they pretend they never heard 'em (Boring)
I'll just stay down here inside the studio (Uh-huh)
Doin' blow and paraphrasin' The Crucible (Witch)
If you fuckin' with the God, that's a funeral (Kill 'em)
Lose your soul, I'm witcha longer than your student loans (Woah)
Who got the ecstasy pills? I need a few to roll (Raw)
I'm a real drug addict, homie, you should know
Somebody please tell Jimmy to put the pistol down (Stop, man! Please, please, please, please!)
He's serious this time, he's gonna kill me now (Bapapapapam! Ah!)
He'll regret it when I hit the ground (What did I do?)
For now, everybody gather round

[Chorus]
It's happy birthday (Woo)
It's a birthday party (Yeah)
Yeah, happy birthday (Sing me a motherfuckin' song)

Yeah, happy birthday (Come on, come on)
[Verse 2]
Yeah, okay
Happy birthday (Thanks)
How the fuck you feel? (Good)
Do you ever sit and wonder what is real? (Huh?)
Do you ever reach to touch her but there's nothin' there? (There)
Do you tell her that you love her but she doesn't care? (Care)
Does she tell you that you hurt her and you're unaware? (No)
Did you hear about a heaven, now you runnin' there? (Go)
Do you think about the fantasy and make-believe? (Okay)
Do you cover up your eyes, you can't wait to see? (Look)
Lately, I've been havin' strange dreams (Uh-huh)
Paranoid they hate me, everybody think I'm crazy
Baby, can you take me somewhere where the sky blue? (Uh-huh)
You can lead the way, I promise I'll be right behind you (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
I do see myself as iconic (Yah)
Gettin' high my downfall, it's kinda ironic
Like a condom, they on it (Woah)
Got 'em in my pocket (Woah)
No time to worry, hurry up and light the candles
Everybody

Happy birthday (Woo)

Drivin' in the car, Sunday afternoon, chillin'
Who is comin' up to my car? What?
I know niggas think you white
And you not 'bout to go in with these bars, my nigga (Uh)
But that is not the truth (Okay)
Word to God, I take another shot of Hennessy
If you don't go in right now
I need your fade right now, bruh
What the fu—

[Intro: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Okay (Yeah), okay
Yeah, the hustle continues, man
Okay, yeah
You's  a wild motherfucker, Mac

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So this the music that made white people mad
Make 'em mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about
You can have the world, it's up for grabs
Up for grabs
Leave with everything, 'cause everything is in the bag
In the bag
[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
When I was younger, I was just a little wild motherfucker
Tryna be like all the people on the television
They had all the bitches that I wanted
All the cars and all the extras
Anything money could buy, they was spendin' millions (Cash)
I was tryna get to pimpin'
I was tryna blow up, talkin' demolition
That boy got the devil in him, swear he need a exorcism
I'm all by myself, got no competition
Keep it real in a world that's filled with politicians
You want to talk about your problems?
Don't you wish the life you lived was motherfuckin' awesome?
Don't you wish you had all the pussy?
Too much money you could spend?
So you could get away and never see your shitty life again?

[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So this the music that made white people mad
Make 'em mad
Yeah, this the shit to blow your speakers out
This the shit you dream about

Up for grabs
Leave with everything, 'cause everything is in the bag
In the bag
[Post-Chorus: ScHoolboy Q & Mac Miller]
And we never done with this shit, here we come with that shit
I ain't stressin', I ain't worried 'bout nothin', don't trip
It's amazin' all the shit that I be comin' up with
Shit is real, tell 'em chill, keep on bumpin' my shit

[Verse 2: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
Yeah, all my life I been a fuck up, never did anything right
That's why everyday I'm fucked up
My mom pray to Jesus Christ (Jesus Christ)
Askin' somebody to save me (Somebody save that boy)
But I'm way too motherfuckin' crazy
(No one can save that boy)
Yeah, all the kids is doin' drugs (Drugs)
They just want to break the law and find someone to fuck
(They wanna find someone to fuck)
Yeah, nobody doin' as they told (Little bad ass kids)
Yeah, everyone out of control (Fuck it, that's just how it is)
I'm self made, dream came true, I'm a miracle
Every time I put my dick inside a bitch, it's spiritual (It's holy)
Got the whip that say ""wealthy"" on my steerin' wheel (Brand new car)
Brand new model bitch made me waffles and some cereal
That's what I call a good mornin'
Your mom work an extra job just to get you Jordans
Just so you could show up at your school lookin' fresh, sayin'
""I don't know 'bout you, but me, I'm important""
I'm so gorgeous
You got money in your pocket, you the shit (You the shit)
You got everything you want
And bitches on your dick (On your dick)
Yeah, a couple grand got you feelin' like the man
Everybody walkin' tall 'til they trip
They just cut the check
You had to go and cop the whip (You cop a whip)
Drive up to your ex's crib
And tell her she ain't shit (She ain't shit)
There's just somethin' about the money
Make a motherfucker crazy
When I die, bury me in my Mercedes, God damn
[Chorus: Mac Miller & Juicy J]
So this the music that made white people mad
