I'm just what you made God — not many I trust
I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, ""Ain't no music on"", she said, ""No, that weed is loud""
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

[Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
[Post-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God (Nee-need it)
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
(Nee-need it) I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow

I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through

When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feeling blue
The sun is shining, man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of

I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 2]
I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 3]
I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

[Chorus]
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

[Verse 1]
My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

[Chorus]
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
[Verse 2]
My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry

Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a

Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human

The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated

I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense

He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
Come on with it, mmm, come on

Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith
In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui

I see everything with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful

Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you
To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
To deny, to deny, what a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?

Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche

Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call

Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said, ""Tonight I feel immortal,"" ohh

Bet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think

I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Somethings will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga

I don't need a bitch tryna tear my mind on my grip
If I had one wish, it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme
Throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed
I stand alone, alone I'll be
Heart of a lion still shinin' in this sucka ass
Workin', workin', workin', for inner peace
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin on so many pills
Hah, they figured that they know a nigga

Down, down for a—damn, Cudi already said it

But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body, known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a payday
Said, ""Bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J""
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right, and get up on this conscious dick

Soarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere
[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh

I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

[Verse 2]
Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere
[Chorus]
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all

Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason

No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family

They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type

Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run and tell that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it

Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns

Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?

I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out ""little Johnny is dead!"" (oh you dead nigga)
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'

I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
(So many colors and sizes, so many surprises)
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
When you live like me you get used to fun
There's an endless supply of the beautiful ones
Open up those exotic thighs
The baddest little bitch half-Black, half-Thai
Don’t be prejudiced, cause she’s mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named Maria, its your turn, I love them señoritas
I like to fuck 'em, then I say fuck 'em
Lil momma can get a little something
OG Too Short don't stop
All the pretty girls call me Todd
[Chorus]
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
(Let me see that body!)
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go
I see pretty girls everywhere I go
Every, everywhere I go, every, everywhere I go

Now when the sun come up
I'll be there to say ""What up"" in the morning
Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher

[Chorus]
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

[Verse 2]
Uh, higher learnin'
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along, lil mama
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
And Cleveland City grinding, man
Stay afloat, the key is hope
I'll never let a motherfucker break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck? If a nigga don't like your steeze
Tell 'em to buzz off your N-U-T's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, hey
[Chorus]
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

The end is never the end

A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself

Y’all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em

Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it used to be
Like David and Goliath, kinda like me
And the Devil tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell

And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable

No cash or check could be more blessed
And if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber
You'd be shook, stay awake
No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward

Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream
Somethin' twisted in me

[Verse 1]
Say, ""I'm waitin' to die,"" I cry
Many nights I spent gettin' fucked up, livin' a lie
Prayin', I'm just fed up, this tequila in me
Don't tell me to be cool, this is how cool I can be, woah
You can try and read my mind
Been pushin' it for days, I'm on a mission to climb, woah
Losin' rеality, been sayin' I'm fine, try my hardest to sleep
Too many issues bubblin', say I'll work through it
How? Think thеy knowin' what the problems are
Had me goin' crazed through the city while I burn it down
This is just my way, keep on prayin' for me
Lonely on my ride as I fly, arms is open wide
Don't wanna leave without sayin' bye
Had a rough night, finna sip some
Don't even worry 'bout it, waitin' 'til the Devil comes
[Chorus]
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream (Ahh!)

[Verse 2]
He's callin' me
So much gone while I blow off steam
And the shit's the same
Oh, look at that, only you to blame (Ha)
It's like I'm swimmin' towards another bona fide life
It's like a fairy tale, wantin' more
But inside I'm vexed, used to question, why
Lord, he show me that I'm tested and I'm gonna fly
I ain't slippin', no, that's not for me
Be who you are, don't be nothin' less, please
Hear me, Lord, don't ever leave, see
I'm a man in the night in these dark streets
Somethin' else, how it felt
Take a drink, I live in excess, nothin' left
Every minute slippin' away, this is hell
They were warning him, figured he'd be cool, who's the fool?
[Chorus]
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it (Yeah, yeah)
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody (Yeah, yeah)
Deep in Hell in dark corners (Yeah)
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah (Yeah)
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it (Yeah)

Hey, I took one hell of a ride

In my head your smile appears clear
Wish it wasn't my imagination running away with a dream
Your eyes they tell it all called it
Hope you have a good heart and you're smart
You've got a good head on your shoulders
That's what turns a nigga on, strong feelings that I have
You'll probably never, find out ever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady

How'd you get so fuckin cool?
Fools probably try to spit at you daily
The price you pay cause you're hot
Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell
And I dig the way you wear your hair too
It makes you look more mature
See I just wanna be a man and I think you can be the one to guide me
But who the fuck am I kidding
Man you know they say I'm wild
But real people rarely come around if ever
You got it going on young lady

Or Mr. Extravagant 'cause I'm getting my money
Way my doors are swayin', it's like a bird on wheels
You can come to Ohio and you can see how it feels
And this the premier of that new-new here
It's gonna take you beyond
Where a jet can't Lear
But all you gon' hear
Is somethin' crazy in fact
How I be burnin' the booth
We'll get you looser than Yak
Yep-yep, you got it right
Now don't get left
Get on your good foot
It's only right that you step
And keep boppin' to this shit unfamiliar
If your main line got time then I be drillin' her
I keep you in my realm
I keep you in the sound
I keep myself up high
Because the haze by the pound
And my imagination
You can look all over the nation
But they ain't see

Salutations my niggas
I'm aware that I'm different
You can still keep it hood
While you're smokin' just listen
It don't matter your race
Just take a blunt to the face
And we all gon' rock
Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin', don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front
Yeah the flow is unleaded
You sucka niggas will front
'Cause I'm Super-Cudder-Realistic-Leaner-Alidocius
And rap ferocious
I been coaching the league
I bobble head the public
If you love it, M dub it
Blood, sweat, and tears; homie, I'm made of it
Finish the class if you think nothing 'bout it
Tell 'em like grandpa, you don't know nothing 'bout it
Wear kicks once, then the Leaner come up out 'em

See you shakin' it fast

You could slap that nigga
If he call you a bitch
Yeah I see you with that
But you should be on this
It's that Henney and Coca-Cola
Come over and sit
Won't you tell me your name
Tell me where you be at
I know you know that them hot
But I don't wanna hear that
You see I aim for a check
Before I aim for sex
Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw
And even at that

In the dead of the night, I have these dreams
What'll happen to me? Will I burn out?
Have I been wrong? What does it mean?
All these things, can't understand why
Say something's wrong with me, I know
By myself alone driving, I go
Full moon as it glows, I search for truth
Tryna be brand new, yeah, I will try
No, I won't do but through these screams
Fighting and bleed, blood in my eye
And I'll be (Another broken soul)
God save me (Yeah)

Yeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone
Just what I need, mama (Yeah)

I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I'm just a star of my movie
They say I'm the chosen, and so it goes
I'm supposed to live and grow old and die alone
Talking to myself in the mirror
Take one to know one
Can we talk, just loony to loony?
How strange the notion
You don't really know no one
And what if I told you
You no longer know me
You better keep going and keep it rolling now
Ain't no thing, you don't really need me
The pressure is growing
Hard times they mold you
Into someone way colder
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em

[Chorus]
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad (Or on one)
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar

I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I got to finish my movie
See my heart has been swollen, it's healing slow
Hope I don't live to grow old, no one at home
Staring at myself in the mirror, take one to know one
Want to find out 'bout the real me?
Certain moments reveal you
Especially friends who were never good friends
But want to act like they know me
You better keep going and keep on strolling
It's so crazy how you think you can play me
Show them pussies you're growing
Hard times, they mold you
To the haters, I told you
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em

It lives inside of me, eating what's in its way
I put black spray paint on my windows during the day
I want to spend time with it, I think I'm losing it
Or I found it and I'm using it
I wear my shades at night so I can look in the abyss
I see something in nothingness if you can picture this
Put black holes in my jar lid, I climb the wall
I'm too high now, I'll die from the fall
Before the water's to our knees, we can't climb when the trees
Wash away, you and I are the disease

Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how a teach had a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young, and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide

But some girls tweet how they miss my meat

Fall in the void

Seems I hate him, too
Seems my color's blue

I always end up back in a cycle of shame
Looking in the mirror is hard
Some days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness
Go on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears
Decoding my sacred heart, flying from here
No more falling apart, ah

You Krusty Krab squad, y'all will rust, y'all ain't hard enough
Demolition expert, I exert through your network
While the Tec squirt, jerk, there's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby, stay with the Killer Hill crazy
Ankle strapped above the boot, it conceals my three eighty
Are you running for this money money? Hunting eggs like Easter Bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me, freak, I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles
Silly rabbit, the race is always won by the turtle
Mental machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I don’t write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries
Everything ain’t what it seems to be
What it means to you, it don’t mean to me
Bzzz, a sting from the killer bees
[Chorus: Kid Cudi and (RZA)]
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks

[Verse 2: RZA]
I pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 Fitness
On the weekends I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic nympho whore for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird 'til she sings out
La la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Gold rings like the Green Lantern you see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton
[Chorus: Kid Cudi and (RZA)]
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
(Dropping them-them-them, motherfucking Beez)

Yeah, the crazy, the wizard
So much whiskey all in my liver

Makes me warm while I high-five sinners
All alone, trying to hide from the shadows

They know where I be at
Infect my mind, tryna get me

Hate me now, then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane
It's a full-time job to not lose my faith
Okay, I've been here before
Alone for the umpteenth time or more
I'm tired of motherfuckers saying that they worried 'bout me
When, in fact, they probably never gave a fuck about me

Uh, little homie, in the room
In-in the room, boy on the moon
(Had-had no-no one) No one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger, they ain't get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely (Hmm)
Lonely in my room
I-I mean me, up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself
Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talked down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown (Hmm)
(Ah-huh) And now my Facebook poppin'
'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit
One day

Yeah, yeah, uh, big homie, made the move
Made-made the move, flew off the moon
Still (Had no-no one) no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Thinkin' 'bout my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga, I was late damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet
Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders
If you knowin' the truth, all you think about is that thing
Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
We getting money, mom

And none of y'all had a clue about me

And none of y'all really knew about me

And none of y'all really cared about me
And none of y'all really cared about me

Make sure that they can't delete me

Lame old same thing

I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better

Only good for a hook, huh? Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to the many things I know
Cold, most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters

Standing in a monsoon of cool, time will tell

You are now in a world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some ""generation next"" shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words, these are facts from a winner

This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side

Then we can meet on the other side

What up, how is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh

(To life) Hello Cleveland
(Hahah) Yeah

Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
""Wonder what them folks on?"" That's what they be askin'
Dumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'
We gettin' to the cash and, you can see a nigga shinin'
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find him
'Less he out on the road ('Less he out on the road)
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just, pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'
My nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a little bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by 5-0
""Sir, you look high"", I know, but I prefer my eyes low

Yeah, they say, ""Easy friend""
There he go talkin' 'bout weed again
Probably cause of all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss
What a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff-puff-pass with your bitch-ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict, tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining
Good look, Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling, Jack

Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable
Snowman, old man, when you trying to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And Pachanga so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger

Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I’m splittin'
This cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran in your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
Not knowing this was all a set up, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on
Nine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door, they shot, I shot, someone dropped shit
The nigga with something to lose just almost lost it
Won't trust him again

Please, bummy? You don’t know me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heine with my Jamie-boo beside me
That's my fucking best friend
When I'm tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am

Soarin' through my world and I'm 'bout to take a dive

Just another evening and I'm leanin', oh (Let's get it)

[Verse 1]
He had one older sister
Two older brothers
And a single-parent mother who
Worked her ass off, did the best she could
There was nothing they could tell him
Let the boy know he wasn't worthless
Even though he was in the same home
He had felt alone, his pet gerbil passed on

So bored in the winter

Such a little sad boy, little sad boy
Little sad boy, Elsie’s baby boy

By the time he was eleven
His father had left him
White church, sitting in the front row
All-white casket closed, he won't see him no more
He tried to disguise himself
Made sure that no one could tell
That in his soul, there's a wide-open hole
Something scarred him, so he can't let him go
He won't

[Narration: Common]
Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too
This is the story of the Man on the Moon26Embed"

Lord of the Sad and Lonely
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Won't you tell me who is; the supreme leader
Still underused, like I'm not a human heater
Move and groove, make a bitch linger
Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger
Not the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch
Up in the hills, still keep it way triller than most
Wanna relax, someone tell me how that feels
I say that now until I go and pop this pill
I say out loud ""You wanna let me cop a feel?""
Now I don't pray out loud but I know that my God heals
Bounce with me, if you don't give a fuck simply
Fed up, won't let up, on the overtime
The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine
I can feel those lames, they love to speak my name
Sometimes dream of breakin' niggas whole faces
In front of the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases
Sky might fall, but I ain't worried at all
Got me some Xannies and a couple Adderall
Plus these racks I go distribute at the mall
In the spirit of God, with some Gandalf balls, yahm
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
And the ones that feel like shit on the daily
Don't let these phony niggas and hoes
Be the ones that bring you low
Let it be from the fatigue from making the pussy bleed
All of the things I've seen and survived
Make a nigga feel way more than just alive
You know my name, you know my face
All hail King WZRD in your motherfucking space
You love it

Everyday, ev-ev-everyday
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep-yah

Yep-yep-yep-yep, yep, yep, yep-yah
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
And the ones who feel like shit on the daily
I got you

[Verse 2]
Now I can show you how to make it, no Domingo Dean
In a way in which the universe has never seen
I feel attention when I'm struttin' in my Prada boots
Checkin' my fresh, if you want, I can style you
So unearthly, my profession is to wow you
Nigga how you not better than me? Listen, I swear to Je'
I feel like Baby back in '99
In the SLS stuntin' and it's all mine
Shittin' on these niggas, sippin' on some Swiss Kriss
I got some jewelry on it, sittin' on my slit wrists
My label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed
Work too damn hard fam, for the shenanigans
Don't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum
Haters, how do my cum taste? No more fun, no jokes, no smiles
Just a grin that suggest I'm the best
Living like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times
So many kids live their life through my rhymes
See, I'm in love with you all 'til the end
When shit was dark for me you were my only friends on the realer
So smoke some tree for your nigga
Ain't nobody got my bounce, know my kushy ounce
Walk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth
The Cud life, you know what we about

Ask about that, pretty simple man

Sicker than any other nigga could be thinking, and

Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive
Without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who an older rapper's kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil' mama switch to Converse without a purse
Long as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em

Gotta smack 'em with some shit before the world ends

I'm at home makin' jams in many wonderful ways
I see in many wondrous shades
Peekin' out the shadows at a new landscape
I've been trapped in my mind, I've been tryna escape
Fame and loneliness, the recipe for disaster
I can't handle this shit, I'ma get plastered
I just wanna go fast, I'm a bastard
I won't stop 'til I'm where I wanna be in line
And there's so many things to do in the in-between time
That's to say I don't get lost and lose my fuckin' mind
Thinkin' 'bout the days I was broke fuck me up sometimes
How did I do it, why the kids love me so?
'Cause they connect with Cudder, real simple
Now let me set the groove with some cello
From the outside lookin' in, shit is mellow
But sometimes I wanted to shoot my fuckin' face off
I'm talkin' game over, defeated the boss
Hope with age, I can cope with my rage
I'm so damn passionate, there's no safe plane
To chill or dwell in, I'm always in the zone
Why did God let Hell in? To test a nigga?
Man, listen, I'm tryna find a way to tuck this nina in my skinnies
It's kinda tough, I don't see how they did it in the '80s
My angels ride for me at all cost
My dad is tellin' me, ""Don't stress, go and floss""
""Live a little,"" I got you, pop

For the things that I've seen have been too damn explicit
But soon you will get it on a CD with some credits

Until I rise up amongst the evils trying to stop 'em
Slow down, bitch, my money is what I'm clocking
I'm tick-tocking, once I start, I ain't stopping

When my room's dim lit, I pray to God to help with, uh

Hellish life, why? Do it live or not nigga, ride by
Fast track, see him in a high fly in line, no, niggas can't be him
And I'm wildin' 'cause I'm young, right, insane, on a trip in the meantime
And I'm tellin' baby, ""Don't try, this is a trip that I gotta do alone,"" mm
Here we are, no shit, tell the boys we get ripped, rage on
This the cops worst problem, hanging all out my whip, yee-haw
This the bond with my fam, this is all of our fix, days long
Can't stop a nigga, no, bitch, nah
King Wizard, nah, you ain't hip, yeah (Yeah)
Hear they tryna stop me, hate on my growth (Yeah)
Cudder on a roll (Hey-hey), he won't slow (No)
You've seen the boy ragin' 'round, don't mean to be mean
But I'm on a high pеak level (Yes), Rolliе with no ice in the bezel, clean (Yeah)

How it goes when you're a damaged man
This is how it goes when you're a damaged man

Serving heat up meaner than your team's is out the gate (Yeah)
Oh man, yeah, I been struggling, dodging these niggas that love to go hate
Boom-boom, you can't overlook him, 'bout to go postal, tell me who relate
And then I'm lost in the freeway, buck ten, thinking 'bout the life I made, hey, hey (Ah)
Doomed since I left the womb, where I run to?
And it's like I'm in a battle, leakin' from a wound (Yeah)
Praise God, thank you, never left me on my own (No)
Shades locked over my eyes, my disguise is on (Gone)
Damn, he found it, that pure bliss, I'm wildin' (Wildin')
Tryna stay grounded, keep my niggas around me (Yeah)
Sometimes on my dolo
While I pull up a smooth toke, lift up pronto
I'm rubbin' on her body
With my eyes on the road, them toes, this hotty (Yeah)

We off, we slide, we ain't scared to die (Let's go)
Speak less, more sex, yeah, we goin' live (Nigga)

[Verse: Kid Cudi]
Element of the surprise
Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash, wipe the smirk off they face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats, solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on, who gon' go half on a zone?
Oh, thought I would be done off that coke, no
Let me tell you some' ho
Ben said ""Everything that shine ain't gold""
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really 'cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished, no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga, these cars ain't rented, I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted, look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie, I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin', no jokin', Cudder's had that itch, so I scratch

So please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted, I'm back

Better let her get that shit off, bug repellent
Hell, they've been telling her ""Nah"" since forever

But see I'll never get
Why the earth is a puzzle that I'll never fit
I'm not of their world
So why should I leave my sanctuary?

How do I know that their kind will truly hear me out?
Will they understand I'm flyin' from a different route?

Right on track, right on and I'm back
Rap Ex-Lax yeah, I be pooin' on ‘em
Damn right, Mr. Cudi he be dippin' on ‘em
Say it loud, y’all want the new-new
Explorer like Dora, that’s how I got a clue too
So fucking underground, barely on Youtube
'Till Day N Night, now they all got a clue who
Took me a minute man, took me a while
Hard headed nigga ever since I was wild, a child
But my ambitions made bitches beg for attention
DJ’s un-mixin' their mixes, just to toss in some Cudder
And I tried to tell my mother
But she ain't underdig, figure me on some other
But see my mommy 'ain't a fronter
So nowadays she calls me a bad motherfucker
[Hook]
And, just when it seemed that the game is hopeless
We arranged some thing for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do
And, just when it seems that the game is hopeless
Rearrange some things for a dose of dopeness

Do my little dance, sippin' out a cup
All my people in the back, my people in the front

Pullin' up my pants, she come walkin' up, and I'm like...

Whoah, Nigga!
Y'all motherfuckers need to understand the fuckin' game
Shit ain't gon' change unless a motherfucker come in this shit, switch it up

Ya underdig, ya understand me?

Movin' wit out movin', pure crush froovin'
Right on track, right on and I'm back
You make songs about some new dances
I make songs 'bout the black man advancements
I'm talkin' classic homie, I'm talkin' monumental
And I don't need much but Dot instrumentals
That's how I lay the stencil, me smilin' up out the window
I'm in the leaner dome, that's my crib on the moon
And I'm livin' in hotel rooms
In the mirror, laughing at my crooked tooth
How a nigga eat, is how a nigga speak
And how a nigga live, is sacrifice was big
And I'mma say it right before the hook
Maybe in due time, Pimpin', I'mma write a book
But now I'mma play my Andre 3000
And dream about an island wit model girls eyein'

It don't matter what you wanna call me, as long as you call me something
As long as you call me, baby

Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sittin' stuck, in emotional bliss
The skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
Tap my knee, I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

[Chorus]
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

[Verse 2]
There's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fish
She like to go the mile
All the while I could see her tear a bit
I forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope
Maybe a French twang to it
Her tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like that young nigga vibe
My brown skin, my shagged out 'fro
I'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me
So funny how the starvin' are guardless
Naked is always honest
Her hands all over my privates, lost in the mood

Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same

Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me

Done off for better and very celebratory

Know the code, want a woman with some toes

I could tell he knows, he probably saudy
No more dodging this shit, the cat and mouse
Finding love in the shadows, ready to pounce

Laying next to him, you daydreaming of my meat
You remember when I said, ""Put it on my face""?

Man, I could've never fathomed
Hate you mingling with these corny niggas, though I don't care how it happened
It's cool now, 'cause I'm home
Sloppiest sex, the best way, we're both giving dome
Uh-uh, until the break of dawn
I gotta, getcha, getcha, getcha on, on
You know I'm the only one to get you revved up
Spread it open, pound it 'til it's numb, yum

Like, what's on your mind, babe?
One blink and you're caught lying

But you can tell I'm bored with these hoes

Takes a man longer to see this fact

Slay them like a machine round the clock

Tossed that shit back, like God must be kidding
And not for a nigga like me, not for the family
Not with a similar plans I just dumped
And I made me some choices, heard voices follow

Closing your eyes, the feeling so right

Clutching your soul to the toll of the bright
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils, you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote an essay for a class, to pass in the night
Have you ever seen an ending so nice?
You feel so free, like you're high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Light, followed by Jag
Models who smile, then tilt their head back

Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night

Oh if I crash, oh if I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
I've traveled for miles, miles and miles
With love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me, so fucking boring
But I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll be okay

When I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
Oh when I crash, when I crash

I'm all smiles, give a fuck what they say
And I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles

Oh if I fall, oh if I fall
Or if I glide, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
I've traveled for miles, alone in the dark
With love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me and I'm fucking dozing
With a smirk on my face, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll find a way

Couldn't tell a lie, I been did mine
So I figured I'd be off to take off to somewhere new (Ahh), hey
And make some memories (Ahh), yeah
In the middle of the night
I'm standin' in the moon's beam
Blowin' off some steam
Wonderin' how I got so done with the high
Not so pleased (Ahh)
No I wouldn't let it show (Ahh)
I always try and outrun my pride
And it keeps close
You very well know you can't run from who you are (Ahh)
Oh you soon see (Ahh)
I tune my mind, body, soul so close
To find out how I'm supposed to walk through the faces of flames (Ahh), hey

And I gotta make it count
To leap bounds
Soarin' over trees (Ahh)
Oh look at me go (Ahh)
In the middle of the day
I hear it in the prophecy, can't come down
It grows in my heart, not knowin' where it goes
Search through pain (Ahh)
And the wishes with the rain (Ahh)
I seem to deny all that blinding light
That only glows to those that really can't run
On just who they are (Ahh)
It's clear as can be (Ahh)
No need to lie into your emerald soul
You surely know gold is always in your glow
Why not let it shine? (Ahh), hey
You're in control of the dream (Ahh)

Wale
Plain Pat

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Off jump boo, Cudi give you funk
Hit you in your head then it work it to your rump
Hatin' niggas can't hate, leave 'em all stumped
They gotta like a nigga, call me Obama
Not a hypebeast while you beast for the hype (no no)
Yeah I'm the underdog, story of my life (yup)
Matter fact I dreamed that I lived twice
Once as a slave who imagined being free
And made it all happen for his family and his seed
And now me, you can call me Mr. Friendly
One life to live, but no acting on my nigga Friendy
Can't stand evil bitches with they Fendi
All they do is envy and plot up on my loins
I give you options baby flip a coin
You get McDonald's, forget the sirloin
Hating my macking, they asking

Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world of ours?

Folarin, the muse of the hater
That music is greater, stupid nigga, bring your face up
Bamas surprised, deprived from attention
Pride of the district all rise so they listenin'
From where gorillas territorial for inches
When it come to pistols, these niggas don't John Lynch them
Off rip that's genius
You niggas so-so like seamstress
No more amore, I refuse to force you
Maybe I lack the fortitude to try to court you
Of course, they all hate
Early adapters agree they all late
So what that say about my watch?
To y'all minds I'm like a UK clock
Hours ahead, so wack niggas is sayin'
What they sayin', young?
They sayin'
What they sayin', young?
They sayin'?

[Verse 3: Kid Cudi]
I was born to do the damn thing
Story of Cudi, nigga getting out my dreams
Zero options to choose
Living in a box full of Cuyahoga blues, and listen
I stayed away from reading The Plain Dealer
Most of my niggas back in Cleveland were plain dealers, uh
Who whipped Supremes, the candy-painted eyes
But the love from the boppers had 'him watchin they rise
Wasn't no love for a nigga in the smug
Sipping out a cup, a concoction for cruising
High off life? My nigga, not even
I'ma go to war with the Devil 'til we're even
Bobbing and weaving, spiritual hymn singing
No commentary my man, I come out swinging
And this will be the song that we sing
Any young nigga with visions when he's sleeping

Sometimes when you have a very powerful artist like Cudi, it's possible that his songs invoke certain emotions and feelings and those feelings are valid, m'kay? You know, another thing that brings up some of these feeling is hallucinogens, which I know both of you have been doing, m'kay? So why don't you just sort of relax and maybe take this as an opportunity to meditate, m'kay? Go inside yourselves, look inward""
