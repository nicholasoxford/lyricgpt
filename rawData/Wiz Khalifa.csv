It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place (See you in a better place)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
Uh, how could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
[Chorus: Charlie Puth, Wiz Khalifa]
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll see you again)
We've come a long way (Yeah, we came a long way) from where we began

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again (I'll tell you)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost (The love will never get lost)
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone (Remember me when I'm gone)

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home

She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

[Hook: The Weeknd]
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me

I might have to take your number when I'm through with you

Make me remember you like you remember me

Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade

I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow

Uh, black stripe, yellow paint
Them niggas scared of it, but them hoes ain't
Soon as I hit the club, look at them hoes' face
Hit the pedal once, make the floor shake
Suede inside, my engine roarin'
It’s the big boy, you know what I paid for it
And I got the pedal to the metal
Got you niggas checking game, I’m ballin' out on every level
Hear them haters talk, but there’s nothin' you can tell 'em
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
No love for 'em, nigga breaking hearts

And bitches love me ‘cause I'm fucking with their best friends
Not a lesbian, but she a freak though
This ain't for one night, I’m shining all week, ho

So many rocks up in my watch I can’t tell what the time is
Got a pocket full of big faces

Stay high like how I’m supposed to do
That crowd underneath them clouds can’t get close to you
And my car look unapproachable
Super clean, but it's super mean

You be anything you want
Just keep going, going, gone, gone, gone
It don't stop here nigga

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your word so never break it
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it
Out selling P’s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate
[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded

[Verse 2: Juicy J]
Roll that weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy be gettin' so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good Cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps
[Verse 3: Chevy Woods]
You known I’m fresh up off that corner, twistin marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we owners
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in the hall
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie

Now let's get medicated

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
All we do is get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it known
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home

[Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'

So I want everything, every room, every plane, every place
We mobbin'

Nigga, we mobbin', we mobbin', shit!
Go, go! Nigga, we mobbin'

[Hook 2]
Now every place that we go, they say we can't smoke
But we do it anyway, cause real G's smoke when they want
When they say turn down, we turn up and turn up some mo'
When they say put it out, it's too loud, We burn up some mo'
Then we keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, and rolling
We keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, and rolling
We keep rolling, and rolling, and rolling, and rolling

[Verse 2]
Nigga keep going, keep the KK blowin
Snakes in the grass keep mowin'
Ass so fat, look swollen
Another city, state gotta show in
Another airport gotta go in
Reason why you hate, I'm knowin
Niggas got too much hoein'
I keep rollin' up
Drivin' a brand new car like that motherfucker stolen
They don't understand what i'm doin'
Money in my hand, nigga, 28 grams when i'm rollin'
Been through New York and London and Paris and back
South By Southwes only niggas smokin' on pack
Rollin' up bats
Go on, get a bong, get a match
Everybody get along, get attached
Get a song, get a biatch
What he say, every dog need a cat
Potheads need a joint to relax
G pen full of wax
10 Rolled cone joints, really fast
No sticks no seeds in the bag
Got reason to brag
In the front, y'all b's in the back
Pair of chucks, ripped jeans is the swag
Little bitch, we mobbin'

And seen the realest nigga I ever met in my life
Hahahahaha, uhh

I done smoked weed where they said I can't
Got rich when they said I can't
Got high and got on the plane
And brought all my niggas when they said I can't
Went shopping places they said I can't
Bought some shit that they said I can't
Jumped on the road and did all them shows
Cause I was poppin' places they said I ain't
Went hard in places they said I can't
Promoters call and try and set up dates
Bought the car with that yellow paint
Go to parties now and they set up drinks
And it's first class, so I'm private plane
Nudie jeans with my get up mane
Rolling papers and Mary Jane
I made 11 mil' and I'm still the same

All of this and I'm still the man

Started underneath the floor, now my money through the ceiling
Always staying on my grind, turned nothing to a million
Used to just tryna live, now a nigga make a killin'
Gold Rollie on my arm, ten rings like a don
Cuban links in my chain, Zigzag on my charm
Champagne on ice, good weed in the jar
Everything Hermes, Chanel seats in the car
When you all know them fuck niggas start hatin'
Talkin' 'bout what they gon' do but I'm waitin'
When you getting rich, they doubt you, but shout-out my gang

And your girlfriends, but being that she's a big fan, of course she made it

But you, just wanna get drunk tonight and fuck someone famous
So I just name a time and a place and your game for it

Young rich nigga, smoking weed when I wanna
[Verse 2]
When I touch down, have that pack, you fucking with me
Fuck the bitch once, she talkin' about she love with me
Let her smoke weed, drink champagne, do drugs with me
We go out of town, dinner at TAO, do clubs with me
What you niggas think, got more bank and more ranks
Smoking weed with some bitches in the club who don't drink
Talkin' about they get money, they got expensive taste
So I put it in her mouth and sent 'em both on their way
I'll be there for one night, don't give a fuck if I stay
Spent a couple hundred thousand in a couple of days
Smoke a pound in my suite and then come up with a play
Bitch came over to my crib and had a comfortable stay
She feeling my car, she feeling my chain
She think I'm a star, I'm feeling the same
I take her abroad, I fuck her insane
I'm switching up broads, I'm killing the game
Long range
King of fucking everything

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Go and roll it, chief and choking, marijuana, reefer smoking

I’m just smokin a trippy stick on this one
OG Hash Oil

Roll a joint, roll another one
When it's all said and done
I'll be at the top bitch
Cause I hustle a lot
Them cars, we pulling 'em off the lot
Don't even test drive it before I cop
Just boarded a yacht
We're at the craps table in Vegas
The dealer saying how he admiring my watch
I'm placing my wager
Don't even care how much paper I blow
Cause how to get this money and stay on
A couple things that I know
I'm blowing that stink by the O
My weed so strong I swear to god you would think it's cologne
I go anywhere in the world and just make it my home
Staying at the highest level but I ain’t make it alone
Now that my money right them suckers keep thinking I'm wrong
But I'm just switching lanes, foot off the brake and I'm gone
If you ain't talking money homie, you can't get a call
Cause this a muthafuckin life that you can't live at all
I'm getting high while I drive, I ain't thinking of y'all...
[Hook]
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas

[Verse 2]
Still rolling weed on my XXL
Only difference is that's me on the cover
Once in a while call my little sister and tell her I love her
Cause shit can get crazy in this industry
Most of your friends become your enemies
That's why I stay down with the ones that's been with me
The niggas who started and they down to ride to the end with me
Make sure the positive energy keep flowing
All the weed keep rolling
And all of us keep getting high, the sky
We gonna keep from falling
Niggas keep hating, but baby I'mma keep ballin'
A lot of y'all turned fake, cause you found out what I make
Now I'm buying estates
Going on private island vacations
Flying on private planes
I'm cool with the pilot, he let me roll something
Put on a movie, let my girl watch it
At the dealer, high, lookin' at that Ferrari options
Just an everyday life, when you young and bossin'
[Hook]
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Roll up my weed as soon as the day start
Get me a pound and I break it apart
Kush on my clothes, smell the green in my car
Ain't coming close, you smell me from afar
Time after time, I keep smoking that herb
Joint after joint, I must be on the verge
Of overdosing, I be on that loud
Speeding me up, while I'm slowing you down
I just got back from an overseas trip
Smoking with Ty, he got me high as shit
Cause we keep nothing but good in our J
Repping our gang and we mob everyday
Break down an ounce, put it right on a tray
Ain't saving nothing, we smoke everything
Light up a joint, let it stink up the place
Or hit the bong, blow the smoke in your face

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money
I'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real
And I love getting high

And I love getting high

[Verse 4: Wiz Khalifa]
Break it down and roll another one, I could get anything I want
I told her ""You should bring a friend for the crew"" (friend for the crew)
Hear 'em talk but they ain't want it though, I'm in the Hall of Fame of smoke
'Cause everybody that I'm with, get high too (get high too)
Only rolling in a Wiz Khalifa paper (Khalifa paper)
Taylor Gang G Pen, smell the vapor (smell the vapor)
Take it to the head before I walk up to the plane
I'll probably get so fucking high
Won't even know my fucking name
You got to be a pro, if you wanna get this blow
Never inhale, teach you how to hit this smoke
And I'm never running out of it (running out of it)
Kush smoke, got a lot of it (got a lot of it)
Smoke like we hit the lottery (hit the lottery)
Seen Snoop, he was proud of me (he was proud of me)
Won't go broke 'cause I never spend (never spend)
If them hoes don't smoke, don't let 'em in (don't let 'em in)

I done kept it real from the jump
Livin' at my mama’s house, we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was tryin' to get it on my own
Workin' all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like ""Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back”
Nigga, I just think it's funny how it goes
Now I’m on the road, half a million for a show
And we...

Then see you and smile in your face
You wanna meet up, name a time or a place
I’m smokin' that fire, my nigga you know that it’s fire
You smell it as soon as I blaze
Burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound, burnin' a pound
Yeah, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down, it’s goin' down

Had a dream bout a car, and went and got it in a year
All black trucks when we pull up to the Lear
All black Coupe, I look like Bruce when I’m steerin'
Hope the homie Drake don’t get pissed
But niggas never ever put your man on songs like this
And I probably said no to it before
But I made 20 millions so we should probably go on tour
And I just seen Waka the other day

Ordered so many of them bottles
So many of them bottles, you'd think I'm insane
Already changed the game once
I done told you but now I'ma do it and now I'ma do it again
Tell the club owners we need more sections
I made these lil' niggas go cop they Rolexes
You get the venue, you gon' need more bouncers
And tell the weed man we gon' need more ounces
Hundred grand in a rubber band
Use to be the kid, now homie, I'm the man

Go to a new state soon as I fuck 'em
Niggas be pressed for pussy
It ain't nothing
Instead of worrying about who that bitch fuckin'
Why don't you get you some money?
9 times out of 10, she see me stuntin'
Game running
Wanna know my hotel
And who phone to ring when she coming
I keep it a hundred
Get love from the hoes, but it's
Money over bitches
Nothing above it
Like the weed loud
Like my engine when I speed up
Bitches holding they weave
Rolling trees
With they pretty feets up
Them suckas often imitate
But they can't be us
So super high
Look in the sky when you wanna see me bruh
Cut my speakers up
Drowning out what the critics say, just
Continue to smoke and remain G as fuck
Polo socks match my Polo hat
She leave once, it's a known fact
That she ain't coming back

I take you up where it's cloudy
Ain't one them lames still rockin' Prada
I go to Louie and blow a couple thousand
One of my baddest bitches
Rollin' up while I'm driving
And she don't even smoke
Just hit it once while she light it
My game tight, seal and sign it
Them niggas just playing
Ain't really ballin'
Saying they being honest
Claiming that's your wife
But we can't call it
She all in my hotel suite
At 3 in the morning
Taking her clothes off
Inhaling weed and coughing
Ain't her first time chiefing
But say she don't do this often
Since I was 16
I had all the intentions to keep it G
Take niggas hoes
And smoke hella trees with 'em
As for your team
You niggas in the stands, you just lookin'
I'm a pro to these rookies
And the plan is still paper over... pussy

Damn, we back in business

[Verse 1]
Uh, wakin' up the neighbors, you could hear the headboard shakin'
I leave all your body parts achin'
Speedin' up the pace while I look right into your face
You tell me that's that good shit you're tastin'
And I know you like it from the side
But tonight I'mma just unwind and let you ride and watch you take it
Cause I'm tryin' to get you so wet, I mean so wet
If there's a record for this shit then I'mma break it
It's goin' down no matter the place or time my car
I got enough space
Think anything you think you want, no prob I got enough cake
All up in it in the mornin', knowin' damn well that I had you up late
Ain't buyin' it you ain't spendin' it, you keep throwin' it back so I'm givin' it

[Hook]
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it

You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
[Verse 2]
Wake up when I bake up that's just somethin' that I do
Pick your favorite sex scene, that's what I'm gon' do to you
Up in my bed's where you probably belong
Givin' you all that I got 'til it's gone
Sexy as fuck you still got them heels on
Favorite position, we tryin' them all
Once I get in can't get out of my zone
Fuck you so good you won't pick up your phone
And when your girlfriends or whoever do call
You fuckin' with me so you tell 'em you gone
You don't smoke so I break it down, you roll it up
You poke it out, your face down so I hold it up
You don't give a shit that my money so big I can't fold it up
Plus I ain't tired 'til you finish, this ain't a race but I'm winnin'

You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it

And they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all
When you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I’m drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke, they bank is injured
Them bitches gonna ride with who they think’s a winner
And I'll be smiling in case they take a picture
Oh, I'm smoking weed, drinking liquor, make a hundred
On a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I tell them pick one
'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business, don’t play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uhh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
'Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I’m gone, gone, gone
I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I’ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
[Verse 2]
Hella hoes in my car, they wanna feel that maximum speed
Never had an absence of weed
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V
Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk, ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I’m making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it’s a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No NBA, they say I’m a baller
Live for today, stunt like my father

[Chorus]
I'm gonna spend it all why wait for another day?
I'ma take all this money I own and blow it all away

The world turning, the weed burning
Them haters talking, I keep earning
Know some who say life's a bitch
Well I’mma keep flirting
Fuck that bitch for the money and Louis V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
Niggas flexin’ hard with no bars, they got weak service
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin’ bitch then what you call that
Nothing but net, ain't back cause I never left
I did everything right nigga better yet
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us
Something like a contracto,r built it from the ground up
Now just, twist up this weed
Realize that you are in the presence of a G
Don’t fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees
Fuck it, you know what I mean

[Hook]
I’m riding round, smoking, my music up loud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
[Verse 2]
See me, when I’m alone, wishing they could fuck with me
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me
But I’m just riding dawg, doing a buck fifty
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and jet skis
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretzky's
My dime pieces only recognize the best trees
Treat ‘em like I don’t need ‘em boy, you best believe
You in her face, I let her breathe
From debated on, to waited on
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on
Cause we are, young movie stars

Bitches ain't say shit to me
But now they won’t leave me alone
Used to walk the other way
But now they all come to my home
And they calling my phone, cause my paper is looong
Nothing, they ain't singing my song
Get hired up, if they want then I bring them along
We flying up, no you won't need a ticket at all
Need a ticket at all, tell a bitch I’ma ball
And I’ma buy a new crib for my niggas and all
Cause I remember days we’d sit and pictured it all
Nigga swear I’d leave or pictured I’d fall
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I’m a star
Cause we are, young, gifted
Not to mention out here making muthafuckin millions
Yeah, I said it, muthafuckin millions
Got my money up, I’m in the building

Hold up
I done made eighty grand a nigga didn't even show up
Niggas used to talk about the way that I dress
Now I see them on they videos pants legs rolled up
Wasn't even thinking bout getting a Rolex
Now we got a Rolex and the whole thing froze up
Now you takin pictures of this shit
Walk around getting bitches off this shit
They just talkin but I'm living off this shit
Kenny Powers really feel like I'm the shit
MC Hammer pants I feel like I'm legit
9/11 not the day but thats the whip
Taylor Gang they be on that shit
Always on the grind tryna keep my mind on the finer things
I gotta get that'll make a nigga rich
Lotta new kicks lotta new fits
Lotta swag that you see on me that'll take a nigga bitch
They get dressed like I get up and go
Grabbing all my shit up and roll
Walked in and lit up the store
Took a dab and roll another joint now I lit up for show
And my bitch is like a pin-up if I like it then I buy it
Most of the time the shit is free and they just in it
Major paper and I'm winning and my outfits sick
I'm a walk up in this bitch and I'm a make a nigga spit up
[Hook]
Can't get this from the store
That's a one of one that mean they don't make it no more
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
Never seen it before
Try spending what I'm spending and you'll probably go broke
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on

[Verse 2]
Have you ever seen a nigga dress good as me
Have you ever seen a nigga go shopping for the furs
Turn around right where the leathers be
Have you ever seen a nigga with some shit wonder where he get it
When you try to get the thing in the store
Have you ever seen a nigga lookin' crazy then the motherfucker
In it but the price you don't even know
Never seen nobody walk up in the store without no money
When they come out they hands are full of hella bags
Never seen nobody come into the store and get the treatment that I get
I guess that mean I spend hella bands
Have you ever got your suit tailor'd by the man
Have you ever got your suit flown in by the man
You don't get that kind of money you don't understand
You ain't ever touch a hundred grand
You just say you do
Like a lame would do
My Taylor Gang niggas a fatal crew
We taking your paper and rocking the latest
You try to hate but my clique hater proof
My closet go on for a day or two
Ain't one of them niggas who switch the shit it up
No I'm staying true like a player do
So show me my tab and who to pay it to
Fuck you and them niggas you came with too
[Hook]
Can't get this from the store
That's a one of one that mean they don't make it no more
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
Never seen it before
Try spending what I'm spending and you'll probably go broke
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on

[Bridge: Wiz Khalifa]
Old heads look at what I got on
Young niggas look at what I got on
Broke niggas look at what I got on
Rich niggas look at what I got on

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
And I'm floating, my windows open
My eyes all low cause I'm off that potent
They jacking my style I got that notion
Can't even get it, you on that slow shit
Pull up in it, they like ""oh shit""
Hella expensive, smoking explosive
Where did he get them? Nobody knows it
Don't even go there
[Hook]
Can't get this from the store
That's a one of one that mean they don't make it no more
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on
I be like look what I got on, look at what I got on

Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm drivin'
Gettin' higher than the Bee Gee's, sayin' we both just stayin' alive and
Watchin' the time go by, climbin'
Told you I’d get enough hash, to make a mountain
And you could sit right on your ass, doubtin'
While I'm somewhere rollin' up grass, going up where the clouds is
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
I say if them niggas got that high man I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
Doing nothin' wit' em, rollin' up or puffin wit em'
Goin' on the road, doin' shows or gettin' ducats wit' em'
I been smokin' in my pictures since Myspace
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight

[Bridge]
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing
Homie I'm straight (homie I'm straight)
The same way I came into the game, If I'm ever going out I'm goin' the same way

[Hook]
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Nigga like me be smokin' while I'm rappin'
And my homies smoke like I smoke so we both just make it happen
Niggas sayin' they be smokin', they be actin'
Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoked one with the captain
High as fuck, choked up in my cabin
Got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers
Never smokin' that bullshit with them fucked up names and them flavors
I remember puttin' weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane
Now every time I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing
Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas just ain't you
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose
Lil homie I gotta ball, its something you can't do
So suckas hate

[Bridge]
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do
(Do what they do)
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too (you can too)

[Interview: Rob Markman & Wiz Khalifa]
I think Kush & OJ obviously is the one that broke you
To the consciousness. So people expect that from you
So it feels like, almost, homage to that but next level
Like the beat by Spaceghostpurrp takes it next level
The way the Seldgren's changing the sound a little bit
Takes it next level production-wise
And then you take it, next level

I'm glad you fuck with it
And that's what it's all about
Taking it to the next level
Elaborating on what we've done
Because a lot of people
They've elaborated on what we've done11Embed"

It ain’t hard to tell I got money
You can see it if you’re blind
You can see it when it shine, you see it then it’s mine
Always on my hustle, always on my grind 24/7, 365
Came up off the corner, quarters, nicks, and dimes
Nigga don’t believe me, look into my eyes
Niggas moving pies, niggas losing lives
Niggas doing time, they just tryna’ survive
Niggas talking shit, see me then its fine
Broke and rich nigga, it’s a very thin line
Speeding in my ride, smoking weed, I’m getting high
Hope you niggas fire, gonna need em’ if you try
All black leather, all black Jordan 5's
Money in the bank, kay kay on my mind
Got some niggas that I’m cool with, some gangster ass ties
All my niggas riding, all you niggas smiling

[Hook]
Shades on so them haters can’t look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
So high that they say it’s hard to look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You’ll see all the shit I been through if you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You gon’ see a real nigga when you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
[Verse 2]
My pops tell me I look tired when he look into my eyes
Soon as the cameras come on I know how to look alive
My mom tell me I look stressed when she look into my eyes
So many people in my business I’m just trying to live my life
You can tell I took a dab if you look into my eyes
See them kay kay clouds floating if you look into my ride
Say I look just like Sebastian if you look into my eyes
Know this whole world fucked up so I gotta raise him right
So we rolling, we smoking on that potent
A boss I got my own shit, Breeze holding on that chrome shit
He down to let you hold it, we all the same we close knit
Roll weed up by the ocean, you closing shop we open
We all know that the bullshit be talking and that real shit be walking
It’s a 9-11 I’m parking, you ain't getting money that’s awkward
Probably say I need a day off if you look into my eyes
Niggas faking but I can’t I don’t look good in that disguise

Hoes get in my car ask what the channel is
Boss shit, look that up my nigga, I handle biz
On fire, like a candle is
Niggas be dressing off the mannequin
Mmm, and I get fresh like where them cameras is
Better yet sandwiches, bad bitch Spanish friends
Coulda been the President rather be the man instead, yeah

Float, no water, my trunk is waving, I'm polar surfing
Blowing faces, I'm shitting on the diamond infested
Time is money, peep the wrist bitch, my time's invested
I'm still the king and I'm thugged out
Any block, any club I flood it out
I ain't one for competition I'mma blow it out
I'm going hard I don't even plan on going out
I get money probably something you don't know about
I stunt hard, you would swear that I was showing out
Don't tell me get 'em, I got 'em and I'mma throw 'em out
And back door on these hoes that I was rolling out
While I'm in this machine, convert the top
Tell them that the sky is the limit
With a foreign freak, she got her face in my lap
So deep you would think that she was hiding in it

Counting 7 digits no wonder why the money calling
Got ya bitch panties Niagara falling
Dollars come like I fuck in the bank
I told them I could, they tell me I can't
They want me to trip when I dunk in the paint
I'm popping champagne and puffin' on dank
Shining hard, boy, these niggas gotta see me

Hold up, roll up, mo money to throw up
Walk in the club, everybody go up
A hundred and 50K just to show up
And everything ain't what it seems
It's hard to live somebody else's dreams
I put all my trust in my team
Know that my money straight, won't let nothing come in between
Politic with my fam, never let the hate intervene
Smoking weed out of Vegas and thanking God for the scene
Thinking back to when we ain't have it
Made it on, came far, needed practice
Moving forward while you thinking backwards
Never sleep, hardly need a mattress
I kick my shoes off my feet, then fall asleep in my seat
Claiming you on your job, well doggie, it ain't complete
Claiming you got the squad but you niggas can't compete
Came with too many broads, can't fit them all in my suite
What can I say? Bring the champagne glasses, roll the J's faster

I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay
I be in New York, I be M.I.A.

I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid

Young Chop on the beat
Uhh

[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'? (This type of shit)
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more (You could just spin it all the time)
Got money, then I got me some more

[Verse 1]
Hundred bottles that's nothin'
I be out Greystone and I'm stuntin'
I be up standing on the couch bottle in my mouth
Pourin' champaigne and spitting champaigne out
Just cause I came up from not havin' shit
Made a couple mill off this rapping shit
Smoking papers ya'll smoking backwoods
Hustle smart, while ya'll hustle backwards
Niggas gettin' lost in the game
Me, I'm all getting sorts of change
Niggas tryna cross in my lane
I'm thinking that it's awesome, fixing up a cone
Porsche getting washed in the rain
Rolex watches, diamonds in my chain, damn look at all them rings
Don't know what to call it, smoke like a rasta
Drink like an alcoholic, like I just came back from college
Take another shot I'm balling, KK cones up in my wallet
Came here and turnt up, Now your hoes wanna' go with us
At the crib with my niggas
They ain't acting like they your bitches no more
[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Post-Chorus]
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up
Got that bombay, now we slowed up
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Verse 2]
When I started this ain't have all of this
Now I came up what chu' calling it?
Couple millionaires on my calling list
Need it Hookah's niggas yes men
Scared to tell the truth cause
Now these old heads think they the new us
Got a bitch so thick call her two cups
And my chain so cold got the roof up
I only been here for three years and made more than you in ten
Told my niggas we started broke and never going there again (thank god amen)
Them niggas hating but they know we don't stop
Now I'm flying out to different places
Talking shit
Demonstrating shit that makes us rich and famous
Money conversations
Obligations, not about a dollar is a foreign language
Now I got everything
A better car, a better team and I ain't worried about nigggaaaasss
[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Post-Chorus]
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up
Got that bombay, now we slowed up
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

[Bridge]
Got money, then I got me
If it's 'bout money, it's 'bout me
Made my way up in the game
When they doubted me, oh
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me
If it's bout money, it's bout me
If you rolling up, ain't no getting high
Without me, no
Got money, then I got me some more (Oh)
Got money, then I got me some more (Yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more

[Verse 1]
Empty bottles of Clicquot and ashes on the flo'
Towel under the do', we wasn't supposed to even smoke
I ain't tripping, never slip or slacking on my pimping
Drop the nerds you with, come smoke a joint with he who's winning
Ain't like them guys who wine and dine to keep they women
My bitches only want two things, that's to get high and kick it
Try my pot prescription, take a couple shots with lemon
Usually have to watch a movie to see how I'm livin'
Yeah, so what's the hold up
Waiter bring the bottle get them EZ-Widers rolled up
Self made G, did everything on my own, bruh
In my early twenties with money as wide as Oprah

[Hook]
Crack another bottle, get the weed rolled up
And girl you know I got it, everything's on us
I toke a lot cause I'm getting bank roll
And they follow me anywhere that my plane go

Say she never been
I'm getting bank roll
And they follow me anywhere that my plane go

Crack a window we gon' smoke this indo
Saying that you still high from last night
You try to pass, trying to beware of the fast life
Kick it with the planes and it'll be your last flight, yeah
OG hash, let you stumble to class right
The sex great, no I don't give her no half-pipe
Housekeepers knocking, we don't let 'em in
Rolling doobies up, room with a Jacuzzi tub
(Say she never been) In the game, I am a veteran
After we fuck, roll the doctor-prescribed medicine
Let you hit it once, then you sleepin'
A fly nigga traveling the world, taking your girl for the weekend
Keep it

Crack another bottle, get the weed rolled up
And girl you know I got it, everything's on us

Thousand pounds of weed
Ridin' in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed
Them hoes dont use they feet no more, they break down to their knees
And suck me like a king
Rosé in my champagne glass and diamonds in my ring
Uh, roll some, thats your bitch on my dick
I might let her hold something
You niggas smoking sevens I'mma need a whole onion, whole youngin, oh
Same ones that hate, same ones that tag along
No Blackberry, too many lame niggas call my phone
Call me world wide Wiz cause I’m never home
Ever leave me round your bitch I’mma get her stoned
And you know that I rock camos and brought fros back
And go download some of my old track
And go play somewhere there’s hoes at
Fucking high, and you down there where them lows at
Gettin tired of hearing my flow jacked
Go head hand me a joint, you can't roll that

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I got a whole lot of OGs, and
I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me
Everybody smoking, yea it's a party, oh, its a party
Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts
Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up
Yea it's a party, oh, it's a party
[Verse 2: Chevy Woods]
Quarter pound of that sour, thats four days on tour
Sleeping on how we smoke, see all these pillows on this floor
Every state we score, fill those papers they be raw
Look like a piece of chalk in my hand
But I ain't writing on the chalkboard
And I heard its a party, its a party its a party but I’m cool
Them niggas smoking garbage, I’m no fool
We give 5 j’s out half zips? Nigga thats really smoking
Ain't enough weed up in that swisha to get you high, you joking
Niggas claim that they be high, they be hella low
When they gang up in the building you gon’ smell that sour smoke
I could get that shit from my backyard, go pick it out myself
Yellow light let me slow it down, niggas need some help
28 ain't enough you need more
All this weed over here, thats 1 weed jar
When them planes get the flying, niggas wanna part
Smoking crash with the plane, Amelia Earhart

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
I got a whole lot of OGs, and
I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me

Yea it's a party, oh, it's a party
[Verse 3: Neako]
What I smoke in one day, these niggas dont smoke in one week
Riding round and its just me, Pepsi can, playing that Bun B
Gotta smoke that dope on the run with me, comfortably, I’m smoking weed
Doing speeds, who with me, probably a chick from TMZ
I make her roll like two or three, let her smoke and feel the breeze
Ya’ll chip in on a half a zip, counting grams, saving weed
Average shit, it was us just smoking out in NY
Swear to GOD we let ten fly, thats ten planes with ten guys
Nine smoke, meaning someone left without his mind pot
Planes Continental, flights nonstop
You get some zips, well get some P’s
Smoke your spliffs around your bitch, tell me how does she breath
Perfect planes, we call them G6′s
And its just me chilling, me and three bitches
Rolling up its cool, come take this bong rip
Pack this bold straight dope, make your lungs rip17Embed"

Quarter million, little nigga, I was nineteen
Had my hustle down pat, I did the right thing
They don't move that fast, they act like they don't like cheese
Had a couple niggas mad like they don't like me
Is it cause I'm hella paid? I think it might be
Yeah my pockets hella straight
And I smoke so much dope I got OG in my IV
So many niggas jackin' that shit don't even surprise me
I don't even want it back, shit it's off to the good
Can't even say I didn't know you would
Make a little money, get it from the road
Bring that shit back to the hood
Anytime you see me, man I'm on the grind
Nigga wasn't workin' when you knew you should
Now you talk about me when I'm on the road
And when I ride by I'm in the newest one

I got so much money I think I should pay for all this

Big money, even larger crib
No I ain't just stuntin', that's how I'm supposed to live
I move fast paced, so I drive faster cars
Take a look outside, those are really ours
And we're really stars
We all travel safe and go really far
In that custom paint, in that suede floor
In that California, that's really hard
In that California, that's what we on
Smell that strong, you know I'm baked
Chances dog, that's what we take
How much you hate, that's what we make
Roll up one, that's what we face
Lot of y'all claim that you real, gon' show up fake
But that shit don't mean a thing
Cause I'll still be on my grind and stackin' all of this change

[Outro: ""Magic"" Bishop Don Juan]
Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys
Step up your game or step down
Whenever a problem troubles us all
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do
And all that he asks and expects of you
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best
And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test
But without God testin' of our soul
It never could reach the ultimate goal
So keep on knowing and believing
All that God has promised you would be yours to receive
Preach, Church, tabernacle

On them nights on a mission, no fear, no hope in my vision
Don’t need no intervention, you ain’t down to rider
And even if you was I come out, point ‘em out, they all gon’ be missing
Wonder why I’m still here act a fool if you met me (act a fool if you met me)
You try to be brave and step up with you crew it’s too scary
Plus I’m too legendary, It’s what we go hard for
I’m rocking your block, you on top you get knocked off
I’m taking your place yeah, I'll make it my property
May be a game to you, probably, that’s a way of life for me
And so it’s only right for me, annihilate ‘em if they in my way or sight
Keep 'em up off of me, a weakness in you only make an appetite
Anytime I get into it I be looking at them, looking pitiful
And their condition it be critical, nothing less than original

Come to that life, I don't talk it, I live it
I got a old school ass car you can sit in
I got a crib that you probably can't get it
I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it
I been at work on the grind for a minute
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Countin' my benjis
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish
When you stay all on your grind you can get it
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention
I be so high, you should prolly come visit
You make a choice, hope you like your decision
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician
She ain't have fun, then she probably was trippin'
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Get to this money, get high, my intentions
Family first, that's a valuable lesson
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together, we stick to the mission
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission

You and your friends, up in my car
Rolling up J’s, flying with the stars
Don’t gotta ask the price ‘cause you already know
Watch full of ice, no light it still glow
It's you and your friends, me and my dogs
Left your nigga to be with my squad
He talk a lot of shit, but he ain’t really on
He hit it too soft, but me I go hard, like
Oohy baby, when you with me you go crazy
I want you to be my lady
Girl you could bring your girlfriends, I ain’t hating

Coke white, so tight, game over
Coupe to the block, bop to the bang
Car full of girls in a blue Mustang
Four y’all, more y’all, caravan
V.I.P model in hand, bottle in hand
Wobble again
I make it crack in the back a Benz while cracking the frame
On the highway, just me and Wiz
With a dirty dozen, about to handle this
Was they cousins or was they twins?
I love it when they both go all in
Like that, this one and that one
See he wants the cute one, I want the fat one
Does she pay what she weigh?
I’m looking for a Jennifer Holiday in my way

And this project is brought to you by
Champagne and paper planes too

Taylor Gang, Heavy Hustle, Deal or No Deal
Yeah, bitch

[Verse 1]
I'm screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Speculating me landing
Must have got me mistaken with lame niggas
Know you gon' get high as fuck
As long as the planes with you
Left that major situation alone
And became richer
People talking down
But see me I'm the same nigga
Leave your bitch around
We gon' drink the champagne with her
We don't touch the ground
See a cloud with my name it
Only e-z widers please
No cigars for me and my gang
Fool, I'm a legend in these streets
Cause how I do my thang
And don't wear the fitted
I got the city on my chain
Oh man, still they hate and talk smack
Knowing if I was gone
There'd be no throne to throw your rocks at
Cruise at maximum altitudes
I'm tryna top that
So in touch with the real
Them suckas tryna stop that
But I, live or let die, party get high
And tell them lames to deplane or let fly
[Hook]
Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin' my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone
I don't wanna leave, but I need to, it's such a shame
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
They gon' miss this plane
I try to believe you
I don't wanna leave but I need to

[Verse 2]
Stuck alone in this wave race
Say I'm living too fast
Don't plan on changing my pace
Got one foot on the gas
There's never a need for brakes
Smoke e-z widers with hash
Fuck bitches from out of state
Valet bringing my cars
A waiter to bring me plates
Shrimp and filet mignon
We celebrate buying drinks
With a couple of broads
My niggas and who got love for me
It's lonely at the top
I'm tired of having company
Uh, so while you busy trying to fit in
I'mma stand out
And view my life through this lens
To see how it pans out
Substitute teacher ass niggas need a handout
Middle finger, screaming fuck them niggas who hated
I'm money affiliated
Pop another bottle, that chronic smoke integrated
Speculating me landing, must've got me mistaken
I'm speaking as the captain of the plane
You's a runner on the jet way
Fool

Don't know what they hate for
I'm just gettin my paper
Well, maybe they'll love me more when I'm gone

It's one and the same, but that's every day
I'm livin' my life as real as I say
I spent it all once, so I'm tryna save
I'm rollin' that dank, she pourin' that drank
I'm out of my brain, weed got me all faded
Lovin' my life, I'm never gon' trade it
I want success, don't wanna be famous
Know how to stay on your grind, it's contagious
Rollies with diamonds for time that it's takin'

But I stay the same 'cause life's what you make it

Stay driven like the valet do, I be cruisin'
Steady winnin', but I'm playin' like I'm losin'
I know that this shit can be confusin'
Talkin' rap, talkin' life, talkin' choosin'

Losin' your mind, losin' your heart

Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ridin' with me, so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high, roll the weed up like I'm supposed to

Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a bitch give me brain call it homework

But learn to get good show money, that's your money
Get comfortable with it, really know money

You tryna copy what's been done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners gettin' tired of tryna ventilate, big mistake
I'm too busy findin' places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like who is this?
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way

Sweatin' bullets at home, wonderin' if she comin' back
Whodi you a simp and she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buyin' stuff for her
We was sneakin' in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena decidin' who allowed in it
My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin'

So much shinin', so much diamonds, all that there comes from so much grindin'
So much weed up in my lungs, I'm in the air, I'm somewhere flyin'
In your town I cop me a pound, show me one and I'll roll one
All my niggas straight drug addicts cause it takes one for you to know one
Bake somethin' and never hold none, young niggas with some old lungs
Catch me out at your college campus, weed rolled with a cold one
Outside with my new car, my Chally parked by my old one
Got a couple of rollies dawg, but I'm usually rocking a gold one
Catching flight on them private planes, Ferrari doors I close 'em
Don't talk a mil', you ain't sold one, don't talk a pound, you ain't smoked one

Sold a few hoes and I bought a new bitch

Smokin' on gas prolly louder than speakers
Mix with the hash, dip in the lean blue dream, I'm a fucking fiend
Standing on Fairfax getting smoked out with them niggas from Supreme
Trippy sticks, bong rips, blunt dip, I'm down to do whatever
She wanna pop a molly man, Juicy J gon' fuckin' let her
For a stronger strain I'm spending bands, this ain't no reggie
When it's 'bout this gettin' high, ain't nothin you can tell me

Fuckin' rich, fuckin' rich, broke ass niggas can't fuck with this
Fuck a deal, when it goes down, got a hundred mill on my bucket list
Y'all niggas gon' keep on hatin' but we ain't gonna stop then
You'll catch me in somethin' foreign and the top gon' be droppin'

Really, really getting it
Now, you didn't rank— number 11 is a nice place to land
Yeah, that's cool. And I did that on accident

You tripped and just fell?

Nobody open the door
Homie I blow by the “O”
Burning it down, kush is all that I know
I done had all that before
Shawty a pro, told her get down on the floor
She take it all in her throat
She wanna go, smell the weed all in my clothes
Fuck her, don't need her no more
Six in a row, get a bitch, give her the bone
Break her like six in them stones
Niggas so cold, thinking I sit in the snow
I keep a bitch getting stoned
Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome
All my dips love giving dome
Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones
Y'all either kids or my clones
We turnt up on marijuana and champagne
Them niggas talk ‘bout who they are, but they don’t do a thing
Can't tell me I ain't drunk I'm on that water in the club
Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke
I'mma go get me an ""O"" and

Got a couple thousand dollars and some J's rolled up
I get money every day so everything's on us
I got my own strain, it come with my name
Go straight to the brain, your shit ain't the same
A different lane, we sipping champagne
I been in the game, just give me a flame
She looking for change, I'm rolling up Jane
I'm balling insane, got more than six rings
In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J
I hunt her today, come up with a play
Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch
I just be up in the way, stuff in the safe
I'm loving the race, stuck in first place
Fuck her for days
Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll
What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know
I go to her page, she come to my place
It look like a maze, we roll up a plane
She look at my change, she start giving brain
If they ain't the gang, then we ain't the same

Got a ticket on your head, let my homie hit the lotto
Big niggas, I don't fight it, see the boom or a bottle
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Helicopter too now, I'm a subject
Face on the news nigga, for the public
Gotta hide at my cousins at the projects
Smoking weed with the Crips in the complex
Twisting OG's with the Bloods in the commons
Cause only colour they see is green
And they're gonna do anything for the commas
TGOD, now they wanna call the feds
I'm a keep smoking all this, all this grass
What you smoking on, nigga? That's a bag full of trash
I was in the 9th grade smoking weed after class
Just a tilt door looking like the car on fire
This the weed mix, you gon' need a few lighters
You ain't never smoke no fucking KK, nigga
And we don't smoke no motherfucking AK, nigga

Laid up watchin' movies in my Bathing Ape slippers

I got a crib with a court in the back, motherfucker I'm ballin'
Kush conin', at the table taking shots and it's gone then
As I called it
(Your bitch want me, woah
Aw man, shit, aye! 28 grams nigga)
And my sweats cost more than your whole outfit
Shit I got on, it ain't from the store

Why would you fuck with another nigga that’s something you should say
Came at the same time I mean both ways

Imma stay ready, Imma stay in her, a mistake

And I'mma make her taste it
Put it in the neck, I'ma make her gag on it
Head in the 'Rari, that's how you blow  a hundred
Hoes come and go
I'ma fuck and then I want 'em
Hoes like J's, wear 'em once then I don't want 'em
Swerve, hit the corner, in the California
Running through these hoes, like I play for Minnesota (A.P!)

Bet this cash make you want it
Girl quit acting you like shy
Grab this dick and jump up on it
I was way out in New York
We were smoking California
She can't wait to tell her friends
Talk about in the morning
Beat it like she stole it
Sleeping like she in a coma
You just wish, she wanna be a fool
Think you control her
Couple grand in a rubber band, you know I'm the man
What you saying, baby what you saying
Tell me what's the plan

Seen my ex, she was not a fan

We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh (So is you 'bout it 'bout it?)

[Verse 1]
Uh, then go crowd around it
And tell everyone that live in your whole town about it
Gon' and roll up that good weed, I put about a pound in
And get high as the mountains
I remember the days when niggas used to have some love for a g
But now they doubt it
Would've been down with me and my team, but now they outted
Put my all in my everything and what I got is
So much money I can't even motherfuckin' count it
Uh, and you can have all of this
After all the hard work you can have all of this
Money and the cars, clothes, you can have all of this
Roll up in the best clubs, you can have all the women
Homie when the checks come, you can have all of this
When you put your family on, you can have all of this
When you let the stress go, you can have all of this
You lookin' at the best, so that's why I got all of this

Oh, uh-huh, no gain
Who said we can't change the world?
Look how we changed the game
Uh, uh-huh, no pain
Oh, uh-huh, no gain
Who said we can't change the world?
Look how we changed the game
Look how far up we came, shit
Look how my chain done changed
Man look at they faces
Now when they look in our faces
Look when they look in our faces
They look at us and we're famous
And I don't know where my plane is
I haven't been home in ages
Got people blowin' my phone up
So many important waivers
My marijuana's the loudest
That mean my weed is the greatest
I give a fuck about a hater

[Verse 3]
Uh, how far you gotta go 'til you feel like you're already home?
And how much you gotta spend
Til you realize that you really never goin' broke
How many motherfuckers gotta tell you that you changed
Cause you got a little change
And how the fuck they gon' tell you you the best
When they told somebody else the same thing
(Come on) Cause you fly first class every day?
(Come on) Cause you roll up all that grass every day?
(Come on) Cause you spend up all that cash every day?
(Come on) Drivin' them foreign cars fast every day?
(Come on) And if you ain't, this the kind of shit you need to get on
I’m talking audemar piguet’s, leather seats to sit on
This ain't just how I feel today, this the shit I been on, I been on

[Hook 2]
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
Cause we already on
We already on
We already on

[Verse 4]
And on and on, and on and on
Never smoked weed that was quite this strong
Never took a flight this long
Never drank champaign in Italy
Never spent a night in Rome
But it's funny cause those are the exact same things
That helped me write this song
Caught up livin' a life where tryin' to do all the right things feels wrong
So I keep rollin' and lightin' up and prayin' to God that we live long

It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up
It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up

People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go

Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes
On my job everyday ’cause it’s hard not to see I
I came up in a big way, and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up
I don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don't wanna wake up from

[Verse 1]
Oh, long days, what I know hard work pays
So the money getting long too
And the Kush smell strong too
That’s that good any chick with me, she the bomb too
One thing I know is go hard young, make fake niggas notice
Blowing money ‘cause you dying if you don’t live
That’s how you know I was fly when I wrote this
First class tags or maybe I’m the first ‘cause of my first class swag
Used to say that I was trippin’, so a nigga bought expensive-ass bags

Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes

[Verse 2]
Go hard young, go hard
They let you in the game, better play your part
Go hard young, go hard
And if you in the game might as well play smart
‘cause I’ve seen niggas fold like paper
Got money seen friends turn haters
Got money minor league turn major
Got money white people turn neighbors
Need a girl, teach her how to roll papers, six months three whips all player
Run my town like the mayor, I run my town bitch I’m like the mayor

Yeah I'm straight, never switch lanes

I can take you up higher than you ever know
Let you touch what you want hit it once and you won't let go, hell no
Let you lean back, inhale smoke

[Intro]
Y’ll already know what it is
We the last…

[Verse 1]
At night that’s when all the lights shine
Ask the stewardess what’s the flight time
Know we grown we all got shit to say
But we drunk so it’s the right time
Outer Space they got a high climb
Out of sight, I’m out of my mind
I did everything on my own, so
I could give a fuck how your advice sound
Who you know sick as Ca-P though
Flow tight as the clothes on the niggas who fight crime
It’s cool to dream I suppose, you never know how far it might go
You might need some love, it might get shown
You might stumble down the right road
Got problems with the structure? Time to renovate
Boy tighten up your circle, keep your business straight

[Chorus]
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
[Verse 2]
We the niggas who could have it all
We the ones who only dream of it then do it on our own
Smoking one and got another roll
Came a long way from no direction now to formation
More legit, more to make, more to spend
Got a thing for champagne? Order it
Waking up in my trap house burning hella spliffs, grinding
Listening to Dolomite rhyming, I’m in
Exclusive bay, break you off something and I’ve got moves to make
Don’t be acting bougie ‘cause you came through with Nate
No Reuss, real nigga before Protools
Got game from niggas that's from the old school
But we them new niggas,  you should roll through
Woke up in the morning fucked up but that’s part of it
I got weed smoke and all this gin, Khalifa always wins

[Chorus]
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own

Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it
Now I made my way in the game
So much money, don’t know how a nigga stayin’ the same
I’m too straight, I get high all day, I take it straight to the brain
I stay fly all week, like seven days on a plane

On the plane and I don’t know where I’m goin’
Make sure my team keep ballin’ and the hoes keep callin’

Where you tryna go, only care about what’s in your drink
You tryna go hard, don’t think about tomorrow
Don’t care about what people think
You don’t care about waitin’ outside
You be with everybody up in the front
You yellin’ “face down, ass up” up in the club

Smoking dearly departed
That’s kill, too real, come to me get it started
And The bottles be poppin’ like its 4th of July

Probably thinking its a game
I might smile a lot
But I ain't playing with 'em

I'm rolling weed, I'm on the flight
Soon as I land I'm gonna write
I'm on the grind

Flying all around the world
Like I'm a fucking hero

That's how we drink Cliquot
And we all from the same hood
That's why we feel the same thing
Like say if one of our pockets hurting
We all gon' feel the same pain
Always smoking out the car service
Police escorting, not at all nervous
We the bomb, search us

Old school backseat, with the stash in it

You don't know about hustle, do you?
It's everything in or nothing

You wasn't mad at me before
So why is you mad at me now?
The alcohol got you talking
You do the same thing, and the cops
Know conversation, know where we playing
Only for money calls only
That mean I can't deal with them old games
That you trynna kick, this ain't Shinobi
I told her baby you thirsty
She responded I'm cool
Said your wrist, its got water
I told her bitch this a pool
Feel me gang that, or concrete dive head first
But if you owe me money, I need my bread first

You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds

What you smoking on man? Aha
What you got in your bag though bruh?

The same shit, new bitch with me
Buy 20, run through 50
I'm running through the stop lights, late night
I told baby girl get your cake right
That kush doesn't taste right
You take it to the head
All you smell is KK and cookie smoke in the Benz
Where my roof go, I stack up quick, while they move slow
White girls in my room, I'm smoking while they do blow
Plush life, no crushed ice
I'm 20k in the game, my bookie loves life
But fuck it, I like to blow cash
I don't tuck it, its nothing
Two first class flights to the function
20 zans, 120 grand, in the city where the pretty girls dance
And them plants grow, in the warehouse
Skinny cash, if you pass me bullshit, I'mma laugh
I'm the man, no lie baby

But you knew that and all you niggas knew this jackin'
Now you muthafuckas owe me
Some people ask why I be low-key
Guess I'm too real for me to act like I'm your homie
A lot of niggas try to get involved when they see you make it on your own
Hear they songs, but they not as real
Cause when you got it all, something's gotta give
And we ain't talking if it's not about a dollar bill

I'm more amazed how you could be such a hater
Getting my lemonade squeezed fresh

I mean why'd you do that?
How does that fall in line with your whole ideology of being a Taylor?

Taylors do what they want to do

Recently you wrote a letter to your fans
And it was about four or five paragraphs
And about two sentences said
“Rolling Papers, maybe I would’ve done it different.”

Honestly, that was just me being real with myself
And real with my fans
Rolling Papers was a learning experience
Just like how everything  was
And me getting with a label and trying new things
Like I say, I'm not a stubborn person
So, I work with different people
I write different records that people may say that they like
You gotta try different things, you gotta do different things
But when you talk about longevity
You can't base that off one year or six months
Or eight months or anything like that

Cause really sometimes I feel like I'm the only one here
I guess nobody cares
But everything's good 'til it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...

[Verse 1]
I'm tired of being tired
And dealin' with your BS
All the while supplyin'
The money for your request
Without me you're a dime
But with me you're a buck fifty
I can get another one quickly
But I'd rather wait it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit

Remember what you said
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doing good way before I met you
Now you're off the set
And I'mma let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow, think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes
The story of my life, you're just another page

But everything's good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have

There's some people coming with me and I know who they are
And some that ain't gon' make it and I know who they are
And I know they ain't gon' like it but it's quite alright
I ain't need no one my whole life, and I done alright
I can do bad by myself, these days you never can tell
Except the people who been with me and they know who they are
Yeah they know my true colors and they see what they are

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
When I pull up in that white on white, they ain't gon' like it
And that green inside they hide it, cause that's they true colors
When I pull up in that white on white, good God almighty
And that green inside my pocket, yeah, cause that's my true colors

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
All I do is smoke weed and get paid
That jealousy I can see in they face
That green is all that I make, call it fate
Or call me perfect with timing
Call me crazy, don't call my phone
Call me covered with diamonds
Call me boss man, young Khalifa man
I was on the ground when y'all wasn't sticking to the plan
Learn the game just like the back of my hand

Cause I pull up in the white, pull up with the black
Pull up in the back, pull up with some niggas that be yellin' braaaat
Have the hella best fans, hella wet sands, hella jet plans
Married to the game they don't need a best man
They know I'm a mogul for real, I branded a color
Pink is the color, can't wait to unveil the Pinkprint cover

New benz
Cop one for you and your friends
Papers two
Rolling papers two
I only do what gangsters do

[Verse 1]
Through with the basics
You think it's a spaceship when I ride through
Feel like I'm on ice, we just glide
Niggas is parasites
I get pussy in a pair of off-whites
Know I want it, you can see it my eyes, surprise
'Cause I visualized it
Always knew I was the man
You just realized it
Don't need a detector, I can see the lies
I'm a different type of being
Drive the type of whip your bitches like to be in
Smoke got my eyes lookin' Korean
Every time that I fly, VIP'n
All of my nigga's ride
Two joints, that's double homicide
Got you rolling papers to me while you gettin' high
We went from coppin' it to supplyin'
Be there at the drop of a dime
All else fails, I can depend on mine
Fuck signs, my niggas gettin' high
Party of flyest, Taylor gang or resign
[Verse 2]
Why you even come back to my crib if you ain't stayin'?
Ridin' with some real niggas, know that we ain't playin'
Pockets on swole and you know that I keep them faces
Money through the roof, I just crash it and replace it
All my bitches bad, I don't fuck her if she basic
Lotta niggas in the game, Khalifa man, the greatest
Blowin' all this money, need someone to help me save it
Lickin' on me all night, she said she love my flavor
Homie, I'm a boss baby, I don't need no favors
Got so many cars, I don't got room for my neighbors
Got a bad broad, but you know me, I might take her
Fuck about a bitch though, I'm all about my paper
Khalifa man will stick to the code, no I don't save her
Suckin' on me good, treat me like a Now and Later
Breakfast in the morn', we can get our dinner catered
Try to hit my phone, I don't pick up 'cause I'm faded

[Chorus]
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in
I've been on my shit, 'cause I'm hot now
I ain't used to get it but I got it now
You can't tell me shit, tell me nothin'
Anything I want, I pull up in
[Verse 3]
Anything I want, I pull up and stunt
Parking in the back, we can't do the front
Real niggas pay the papers, a plus
Ain't with the gang, you can't sit with us
Take them bitches phones, ain't no thang, we don't trust 'em
Send 'em for the gangs, why they came, we don't love 'em
Takin' all our time, we don't need to rush
Smellin' like the KK, it's serious
Grind every day, 'cause the process I trust in
Think they the way, but they bluffin'
Baby, I can spend it all, don't care how much it's costing
Grind and you get all this, my niggas is ballin'

Got no time for the conversations or funny shit
Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with
Used to turn on the TV, see what I want
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in
In the 6-2, almost 26
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip
I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit
They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public
You young, black, then you thuggin'
What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'
Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself into something great
They should use that story to motivate
But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead
Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived
25 and not dead

[Hook:]
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You make a little money, take care and right yourself
And people start coming up with they hand out
People take their stresses and make them yours
Well that's just what comes with being a man
I try to do all that I can to make sure that
My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through
But in life we all got our own path
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to
Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me
Cause we had so many cars it was stupid
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me
Made a couple million and fast too
They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom
Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it
Instead bein' in the game, be ahead of it, in a better whip

[Hook:]
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills
[Verse 3: Curren$y]
Thousand dollar benefit plates
No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place
Now I'm high, Empire State
Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace
I'm one of them under-celebrated greats
Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me
Soon as I stepped off the plane
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne
I been in the crib enjoying my habits
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me
Try me
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in
Come out with the whole hen
A dollar and a dream
Have a house on the hill and the world on a string

[Hook:]
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no

Smokin' big green, I'm talkin' Godzilla

The whip was sick enough, I went and got the ill one
Your tree wasn't enough, good thing I brought some killa

My wife's a queen with diamond rings and full chinchillas

Keep it pimpin' and pay close attention, you might learn somethin'
My family is all I need, I make sure that we gon' eat
Overtime, 25 hours, 8 days a week
I remember back when I was broke, how could I forget?
Nine bathrooms in my crib, I got a pot to piss
My look my momma's face when I bought her a new home
My mom, we finally made it, them hard times is gone
Finally made it legit, ain't no way I'mma quit
Got a cone full of guacamole, let's go get these chips
(Hustlin', hustlin')
All the money coming in so fast you can't resist
(Hustlin', hustlin')
Cause there ain't no such thing as gettin' too rich
(Hustlin', hustlin')
You will never hear me say I don't want no more
(Hustlin', hustlin')
This Juicy J and gettin' to the money is all I know
[Hook: K Camp]
When you stay out and your chopper stay focused
She gone be the best
Do what you can when your team get a chance
Put it all to the test
Came for it all, know you heard this before but
I don't more less
Grindin', you fall now you done with the tour
Get it all off your chest
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect
Hustlin', hustlin', hustlin', hustlin'
That's all they respect
When you go hard
You go hard and don't stop until ain't nothin' left

[Outro: Juicy J]

Way before your time the world knew this would happen
Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you
As you were brought into this world
You tried to find out about your surroundings
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember
Authentic is due to the choices you make for yourself
It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget
But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means
Us and never I is one of your greatest attributes
Others before thyself as long as long as thyself is taken care of is well being
And money, well, I know you know how to get money
I'm gonna say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it
Let's celebrate, Blacc Hollywood

And we be in the club, buying all our champagne
Spillin' it on the couches
Me and my niggas deserve this shit
We was there for the come up
I am Blacc Hollywood, I live Blacc Hollywood
[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, yea, yea
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love
That's no love
That's no love
That's no love

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Pull up to the club with my thugs smokin' so strong
Hop out and walk through the back, so high I don't know where I'm at
Them bitches get open, I'm with some niggas who all 'bout that action
Poppin' them bottles, you look outside, see them foreigns
She get them dollars out them niggas cause she ain't lookin' for love
Smoke that loud up by the pound, she get champagne and drink it up
Hope you ain't a Captain Savior cause she ain't lookin' for cuffs
In the club spinnin' face, she in your face, you think it's love
Said you throwin' dubs, bro that ain't enough
Money, clothes, and drugs, that's what bitches love
Rollie cold as fuck, that's what bitches love
Back to the topic, pop that ass and please don't stop it

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, yea, yea
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
That's no love, that's no love
That's your bitch, get her bed in my truck
You ain't give her what she needed, and she ain't lookin' for love
Homie she don't want no flowers, only make her cum

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Poppin' ass, kinda naughty, met her ass at the party
Took her to the after party, drink some gin off her body
Spend some ends, now I'm going in
Took her and her friend, hit the skins
Then we smoked again, eyes like I'm Korean
Shots of gin, that's what all this juice is for
In Blacc Hollywood, that's my newest car
I'm like eney meeney, I got plenty
Pockets filled with hundreds, fifties
Nothin' lower, come fuck with a stoner and get stoned

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, yea, yea
Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love
That's no love

Nigga all I smoke is papers

All I smoke is papers, all I smoke is papers
I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor, throwin' up the gang like a banger

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
All I know is smoke when I’m in a ride
All I know is count while I’m getting high
All I know is Flex while I’m in the club
All I know is show them hoes no love
All I know is buy a hundred bottles pour ‘em
All I know is old school or foreign
All I know is make sure they know your name
All I know is ride out for your gang
All I know is make them hoes cone joints
All I know is keep your niggas on point
All I know is have my money on time
All I know is grind lil’ nigga, grind
That’s all I know

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Twisting up our fingers, all in your face like what's happenin'
My niggas hop out and get to smashin’
Sock a nigga first then ask him
Where you niggas from? What you niggas bang?
Snatched a nigga chain, he ain’t with the Taylors
This nigga jewerly fake, he ain’t getting paper
He's a fuck nigga, not a real player
I took his bitch and made her learn how to roll papers
Off Youtube, you should do it too
Type of bitch that like to be around the who’s who
Yeah she get around, she like a hula-hoop

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
All I smoke is papers, all I smoke is papers
I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor, I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor
All I smoke is papers, all I smoke is papers

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Big bag of that, coming back for that
Roll ‘em back to back, keep a sack of that
Don’t imagine that, that’s a matter of fact
Eyes down in the clouds where you find ‘em at
In my MCM bag where the magic at?
Come back to my room, jump on the broom
Swear the magic happened, she hit the magic dragon
Her ass started clapping, I was glancing
Smoking kill, that’s that extra pack
Tell the DJ to bring it back and tell the weedman to bring a sack
I got a bong and I got a biatch, ass fat, body full of tats
Pick her up, fuck her on the jet, nothing less
[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
All I smoke is papers, all I smoke is papers
I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor, I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor
All I smoke is papers, all I smoke is papers

Uh, smoke Kush so I got no stress
Stuntin' it ain't no contest
Diamonds all in my Rolex, cuz' I go hard like P90X
See you dudes copyin' our moves, now you follow in our steps
Lil' kids just in the mirror, all insecure just trying to flex
Speakin' of Flex, shout out to Flex
And everyone else that said dude is next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try the rest, now try the best
Gangsters, trippy niggas all here
With me nigga, my weed, so strong
My Brain, so gone, Ooh
Outer space

Solar, ooh
My Chain, polar, ooh
My bank, so long, ooh
Like I was playing poker ooh (poke-her ooh)
My face on the tele, so fuck what they tell me (what they tell me)
I always keep it real cuz' the people love the real me
They ran up on my bus cuz' police said they smell me
So me and L O L A, blow and smoke in LA

Flossin', Straight bossin', Take strains, we cross em'
My chains hang, they cost em', They hatin', we awesome
Throw back on drinkin' lately I've been thinkin'
I've been partyin' too much and livin' like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
That's when I pour another drink and light this weed
You really sure you want to grow up to be just like me?
[Hook]
They say I'm livin' it
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Them, them haters, them ha-haters they sick of this
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
That, That paper, That pa-paper I'm gettin' it
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Them, them haters, them ha-haters they sick of this
