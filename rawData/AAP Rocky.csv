Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju-, okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I'm beast

Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally

Vacay'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali (Mmm)
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Mmm)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Mmm)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow (Mmm) Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holler back, I'll do ya, beast

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
We outlawed, then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""Doo, doo,"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm, mmm!""
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

[Verse 4: Yelawolf]
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
[Verse 5: Danny Brown]
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
[Verse 6: Action Bronson]
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
[Verse 7: Big K.R.I.T.]
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist380Embed"

Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 1]
Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass
[Chorus]
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes

Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

[Verse 2]
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough

Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more

I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7

Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch

I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow

But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine

So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!

I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say ""I love you""
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD (Acid)
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, ""I really wanna let it go""
[Bridge 1]
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh

Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high

Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians (Uh)
The land of no religion (Uh)
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me

Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind

Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom (Uh)

Making hits, sniffing lines (Yeah)
Out committing crimes (Yeah)
Wait for shit to simmer down (Uh)

Do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya (Uh)

Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay

Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris, fuck niggas wanna diss

Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand-up guy, I'd rather stand out

If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down

Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose

Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like ""Fuck them niggas!""
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas

Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch

Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say (uhh)
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script

Take a pic, be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G

Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die

Rollin' in my Benzo
Hoes on the curb, a couple of friends
Rollin' down my windows
Yo, what's the word? Fuck it, get in
And ride 'round with these bimbos
She gave head to my kinfolk
Shout outs my connect though
Keep a watch out for them Winslows
'Cause the boys' gon' creep, D-boys gon' serve
Hoes gon' skeet and the V gone swerve
I'ma get by while the world gon' turn
I'ma get mine like you gon' get yours
Niggas do the least when the piece got nerve
Niggas in the streets when the heat got burned
I'll tell a nigga, ""Be you""
Fuck tough, be cool
Couple young niggas down with my crew who be down to let it fly
[Pre-Chorus]
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, young nigga like me (They let it fly)
For a nigga like me, jiggy young nigga like me (Flex)

Mr. Pistol Popper, Flacko locked and loaded
Life's a bitch and she pussy pop, know why? Cause I got her open
That pussy soaking, fuck is you promoting?
Yeah, you claim you rage, you hating like you live in Oakland
All my rap town niggas with the roof back
Introduce you niggas to the new swag
Make you say a nigga blew up too fast
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new ass?
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the ""Juice"" back
Get your popcorn, juice, snacks
It's a movie nigga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps
Look at all the niggas that I blew past
Hood by Air, to the do-rag
Nigga make way for the new jacks
[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
Yea, uh

Yea, yea

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It's Mr. Pistol Popper screaming, ""Fuck a copper""
I just bought a crispy choppa, finna fuck your block up, blocka!
Even cracked the pavement that's for niggas hating
I been impatiently waiting to show you niggas Satan
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Bitch, I'm Trillmaluminati and got my crew behind me
Shooters round me, keep them looters round me
Keep a tool around me, it'll keep you fools from round me
Couple of them dudes surround me
With a gat, with a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat, better back back
On a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass that, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks with a ass, finna smash that
Make 'em catch that, A$AP, then I pass that
Off to my niggas then she ask, ""Where the cash at?""
I see dead people, I need dead people
Lord Pretty Flacko, bitch, I behead people
Kneel and kiss the ring, all hail the King
Long Live A$AP put that on everything

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but who will lean if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, ""Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now yo' ass is acting""
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo' ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Joe Fox]
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know
[Part II]

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Okay, let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead, bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the ""love"" word
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh! Man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male

Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, Céline, Tiffany, she flossy (Oh)
Ain't concerned with who bought these
Can't forget that she bossy
When y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave (Brrr)
Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait (Oop)
Barely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need
More hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Tap the vein, whoa, barely look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll

When I was young and living homeless
Now I rock the Ricky Owens
Eyes lookin' like he rollin'
Got new bags under my eyelids
New bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin'
New bags on new bags
Mind's better at seeing two now (Ah, down)
Needing up on my downtime (Down, down)
Hit the waves with the new sound (Down, down)
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope (Sauce)
Take a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone, she like ""Son, you the boss"" (Ah)
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment (Ah)
Can't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen

So hold me tight, I swear, I'm golden

When you try to get peace of mind
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (Ooh, going to find)
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (I'm going to find)
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill, Frank Ocean and  A$AP Rocky]
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (Ohh, do do, do do, oh)
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (Oh, oh)
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (Oh, oh)
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (You make my desire pure)
""I gotta find peace of mind"" (You make my desire pure)
I just need peace of mind for my purity
""You make my desire pure, just tell me""
""You make my desire pure, just tell me""

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky and Lauryn Hill]
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab
""I'm undone because""
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that (Hold on, my nigga, hold that—) thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like
""I'm undone because""
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me (A$AP)
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace

I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it
[Bridge]
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin

[Verse 2]
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly
[Outro]
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise

She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms

A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall

But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized, things pan out when it's right
In the meantime I'ma grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city, the one that's surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane, got no time, don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter, she's all I need
She got her father, as I grow
Hell yeah, I did it, I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be up with my nigga, no
I'm just gettin' warmed up, let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas, so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow
A$AP and Cud Life forever though
And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those

[Intro: Lil Wayne]
P.O
One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
(You ain't got no Flacko in your Serato?)
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least (2 Chainz!!!)
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, ""throw on the dress with the pinstripes""
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed, comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though, them diamonds

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's
Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Make 'em talk about, talkin' bout M's, nigga
Talkin' bout M's

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'ma be up tonight, cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right
I got mean, I got nice, that's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl, I'ma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems, let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out, she limp, it's dark and we dim, yeah
We dem niggas, handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga, Tunechi129Embed"

Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toenails
Them vampires, them bloodsuckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it, 'bout it, we rowdy, rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm 'bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash, fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag, niggas is wickity wickity wack

Got a new Cadillac with a diamond in the back
Got a bitch and she bad with about a hundred tats
Got my goons on deck, and we got a hundred straps
What you know about that, got me swaggin' to the max
Everybody know we got the shit and baggages to match
Better come correct, fuck what the basis is
Gold grills like a set of new braces

Why they comment on my set though, they lookin' cause my neck gold
And I let that Tec show... hear that echo?
Let go, that medal, .38 special, to your threshold

For my mothafuckin' niggas who ain't wit us, keep it trilla'
My gold teeth, my french braids, getting throwed since 10th grade
Wealth is in the mind, not the pocket, if that's the case, then I been paid
Herringbone chain, my gold frames, my Cartiers, you small change
You bitch made, I'm old school, like gem stars and switchblades
I spit game, I get paid, a pimp game
I be, I be that pretty muthafucka, A$AP is just my nickname
(I'm comin' down when I'm tippin' on them 4's
Cause we shittin' on these, shittin' on these niggas and these hoes)
Cause that purp shit I sip up, your bitch chose, you slipped up
I get-get my dick licked, I'm draped out, drip-dripped up
Top of the top of the line, all on my grind, purple be easin' my mind
We runnin', we runnin', we gunnin', we gunnin', we're gonna hit one at a time, time
Them bad bitches blow kisses by my earlobe
A weirdo but I'm real though

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
All these boppers wanna bop 'em, niggas wanna jock 'em
Not a red light or a city cop that can stop 'em

Fuck it man I'm past dope, sour diesel slash coke
A$AP we the last hope, fuck it this my fast flow
I slow it down I pick it up, blue jeans I rip 'em up
That's swag bitch, you mad bitch, see you in my past bitch
I'm headed to the future, Twelvyy ain't no loser
Mixing up that syrup, call it Punky Brewster
I'm slurring wussup, don't tell me to shut up
I ain't tryna start shit, but man I'm really fucked up

Make a nigga feel good to the point I wanna marry her
But I be on my pimping shit, check out my limp and shit
I be getting money, getting money, can you dig it, bitch?
Hoes get on my pimping ship all aboard, all aboard
East coast mothafuckas making all the noise, all the noise
I know you niggas heard of us, Raf Simon murderers
Fashion killa' word to Bigga Bars, I never heard of ya
Still sipping candy painted whips is what I'm sitting in
Kitchen chemist whipping up that shit that get these bitches in
New York Nasty flow, that's a little bit of crack mixed in with a fifth of Hen

""This negra kept his soul from the Devil.""
It's true, I guess I mean, wait a minute now
Is your people really that God damn ign'ant? Really? Really?

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, ""Quiet down""
Bow your head, the Most High's around cocktails
Guys and gals miss me, ties and gowns happen now
My entire sound is how you tryna sound? Stop it now
They ask me why I don't go to church no more
'Cause church is the new club and wine is the new bub
And lies is the new drugs, my sister the next stripper
My brother the next victim, my usher the next tricker
Satan givin' out deals, finna own these rappers
The game is full of slaves and they mostly rappers
You sold your soul first, then your homies after
Let's show these stupid field niggas they could own they masters
Holy smokes, I think my pastor was the only folk
To own the Rollie, Ghost and Rolls Royces with no Holy Ghost
And get your shit prepared, face your fears, all you niggas scared
Say your prayers, pray you fit upstairs, it's our only hope
[Break: A$AP Rocky]
Church bells and choir sounds, tell 'em, ""Quiet down""
Bow your head, the Most High's around, Lord
(These things are not right, these things is not right) Lord
(Hell, nobody's ever defined) Lord
The pastor had a thing for designer glasses
Yeah, I'm talkin' fancy plates and diamond glasses
The ushers keep skimmin' the collection baskets
And they tryna dine us with some damn wine and crackers

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Who's more important than your Lord and Savior?
Won't let the pearly gates up in this
Probably due to all your poor behavior
My mental got a couple tips to save ya
Just be sure to count it as my only favor, thank me later
Uh, every night I stayed up sayin' prayer, made me greater, uh
Let's savior chasin' green for collard greens and baked potatoes
On the table, pray for cable, hit the label, now we major
Ha, I got my own relationship with God, Lord

Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Bless, sit back and relax one time, clear your mind
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)
'Bout to send me back to my old ways, know what I'm saying?
(Moving on to better things, I'm sure)
Yeah, I'm just, she making mistakes
(Can't feed this addiction anymore)

Cop a lot and pourin' up

A generation's thrown on drugs

[Verse 2]
I swear that bitch Rita Ora got a big mouth
Next time I see her might curse the bitch out
Kicked the bitch out once cause she bitched out, spit my kids out
Jizzed up all in her mouth and made the bitch bounce
Ride with a nigga mane, and you know
I stay fly like the jigga mane, and it figures
Cause here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes
Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts

[Chorus]
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
(Moving on to better things)
Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP

My hair wild, my gold fangs, my eyes red, that's beast mode
New hoes, I keep those, bad bitch by the week, oh

Leave a motherfucker layin' still
B-bang him with the stainless steel
Cause I'm making the order
Laugh at the altar, pullin' a Lord up
Don't get someone sawed up
Your brain in a sawdust, niggas is washed up
I bang out in Florida
Shoot in Miami, goons out in Georgia
Been to New Orleans
But still a New Yorker, nigga the talk of
Town, nigga we bossed up
Bounce, but when you talk to the Lord
Of course, you're forced to
Bow down like a motherfuckin' peasant
Still that pretty motherfucker
And you know Harlem's what I'm reppin' nigga

But grab the Jimmy so the bitch don't get no cash up out me

Fuck niggas talkin' trash about me
But you know I toke a gauge, it can make any problem go away
Talkin' Jay, talkin' Ye, that mean you niggas talkin' cray
Razor blade across your face, I fix my face then walk away
I guess then there's nothin' more to say
Trill nigga to the death, whether Hell or the pearly gates
I think back to my early days
Whippin' and pinchin' that broad dough
It's a bit different now, switchin' and flippin' that raw flow
Substance get me higher, reefer and some fire
The devil is a liar, biased preachers shall retire
Jesus walked on water, I'm preachin' to the choir
Long live A$AP, now bow to your Messiah, bitch!

For instance, I get-get my dick licked
Red bone, complexion like a piglet, kiss-kiss
Fuck Ace, we sip Cris, afford it cause I'm getting it
Drip-drip, the thought of it is ignorant, isn't it? (Hahahah)
I'm ticklish, stunting is my business
Swagging on you hoes and I'm shitting on you niglets
So little homie, peep game
Cause these other rappers lame and don't care to do the same

Well, let me tell you 'bout a nigga like me
I be smoking, choking, black locing with the OE
She wanna take a dick ride, we slide
Straight to the telly, shaking her jelly with my dick inside
Hit it in motion, in slow motion, hit it
Nigga she open, nigga I'm poking, split it
With it, get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs, let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said, I'ma still do me
Groupies, be sucking and fucking, porno movie
Do we have a problem in here?
Look a nigga in the eye as I notice the fear
I am severe, my style is hella sharp like a spear
All I do is sit back and think with the 40 beer
And you gotta feel the funk
While the bass plays loud, booming all in your damn trunk

We use to wear rugged boots, now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
My partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules, I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we﻿ sophisticated goons
I know you live by the gun, then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swaggin' in philosophies
White on white wagon, call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass niggas, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunting, yeah, I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious, so serious, Wapanese
Niggas say I'm blessed, my bad I forgot to sneeze (Achoo)
There your reasons go, bitch
I got some tissues for your issues, tell 'em blow this
Bitch!

[Chorus: Santigold]
Make my money, walk straight ahead now

With the stocking cap, Jason mask on, probably strapped (Just as sheeps get led, ohh)
It’s the Rocky cat, turn my swag on, holla back (You could see where I'm going, ohh)
Throw a dollar at a bidd-itch, tell 'er suck my di-dick
Cause they hatin' on my clid-dick
Cause we made it when we did it, hate it cause they didn’t
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
Ride with the pretty nigga, hoopty, no chauffeur
Paint lookin' like a drippin' smoothy, no coaster
The game's full of posers, big dog bulldozer
Pop up on 'em like toasters, wake 'em up like Folgers
Cuz Heaven need a villain like Hell need a newer idol
You could bet the crib and car, just renew the title
For now I’m po-pimpin' like them Do or Die dudes
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal

Yeah, alright, alright
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Smoking, rolling reefer up, I adjust the tweakers up
(Break it, break it down) Break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back? Where the welcome mat? My sneakers tough
This is for my old head, gon' turn your speakers up
""Rocky, where you been?"" I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or 10 Deep
Bottles full of Rose, riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast, now I'm finna think I'm (Big Meech)
I met with my old head, we sat for a while
We rolled a couple Swishers, we chat for a while
I said, ""I'm just on my grind, I come to Houston all the time""
He said, ""What's been goin' down in your New York state of mind?""
Fine, you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up?
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck, roll another Swisher up
Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere, nothin' closer than a townhouse
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out
[Chorus]
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

[Verse 2]
Now my old head old age, bald head, Rogaine
Code red codeine, nose red, cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken, shrimp lo-mein
Gold chains, afros, platforms, Soul Train
And he told me 'bout that rapping, trapping in the old days
When Pac hung with Shock before that rat-tat-tat-tat, nose rings
And I'm so high, I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, we slow swang
We tip fours, on chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up, that's my old dame
Pick it up, I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said, ""Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home, leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin' 'cause that type of shit'll get you clapped""
[Chorus]
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, and foes, they be fake
If you listen when ya old head talkin', you'll be straight

So, so

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceship
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh

[Chorus 2: Joe Fox & A$AP Rocky]
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep
[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days of razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Them boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, a whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I'd give (fuck)

When I say I got beef, they don't want no beef
When they say they got beef, they don't wanna eat
If he said he wants smoke, they don't want no steam
She put a V on her tee, bad bad bad bad bad
Had a bachelors degree, Ph.D. while sellin' speed
Fix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem
Hit up Bloc (Brrr), ""yo' this Flack, nigga, where you at?
Pin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the app""
[Interlude: BlockBoy JB]
I need money and company, nah nah
Bad bitches, I don't even know the company, hahahaha

You—you—you can't hang baby, we don't want you 'round here

Y—you got bad bitches, hella hoes, i—i—it's the same here
You bad company, lil' bro, you can't hang here
G—g—g—gettin' money so the bottles keep on comin'
Ph—ph—pho—pho—phone ringin' so you know the trap jumpin'
Tha—tha—that nigga lookin' at me, he owe me some money
Hit 'em with the Tommy, now that nigga crumpin'
Why—why these niggas playin' games? They don't want no problems with me
My shooters got good aim, you know I brought them shottas with me
Might have hit a bad stain, they say that someone top was missin'
Them niggas were opposition
They move wrong, so I shot them bitches

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Dark shades, too much smoke, I could barely see the fumes
Actin' brand new like I don't see you when I do
Who them folks? Who want smoke? You too close, give me room
Phony folks, play it close, do the most, don't they?

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Mad cow disease, now you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees
[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Flintstone bust down, color Murakami
Fruity pebble bezel, Wilma, Betty, Fred, and Barney
Bad bitch from outta town, I think she model Abercrombie
Wrist game Lucky Charmy, told my jeweler Leprechaun me
I'ma come clean, I got hella beef
Paranoia got me rollin' up my sleeves, okay
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm uppin' up the fees
Whole team got V's on they tees, all day

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day

I'm tired of these dances by these fucking backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters, I'm sick of phony niggas
I'm stickin' to these bitches 'cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive
I'm sick and tired of my environment
Sick and tired of feeling deprived
I'm one of a kind when in my climate
Sick and tired of your façade
And all of your lying and your diamonds
Basically, I'm tired of feelin' sick and tired

Every nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attraktion
Shout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre
If you disrespect them niggas then I'm polishin' the nine-trey
And I'm coming to your casa for your madre and your padre

Doubting myself 'cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise, everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it, they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem World to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
'Cause last year, it was shoebox and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's twenty years of memory

Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
A$AP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how

Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Testarossa, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get in and get chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her

Everyday was like a beef to me

You don’t wanna draw heat with me

Cooly nigga, you don’t really want beef
I’m Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep

And baby I wonder, baby I wonder

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard-headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat? (nigga)
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak (nigga)
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga naps
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats

It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what the blood clot
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip...

Am I still too young? Am I still too young?

Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post, while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna, and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy, but Rocky been jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met Jay Hov
(Who dat? ASAP) But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in my new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing
Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne (Uh)
Fly kicks, my shit (Uh) yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, so save the bullshit for the Q-tips

I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that

He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck 'bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you feel

Got a group of hoes in MIA, get a condo in Biscayne
The Louis store, I drop bands, the Gucci store, I drop bands
Prada store, I went HAM, my left wrist, it cost a Lam'
Your girlfriend a groupie, like Trident, she wanna chew me
Hell naw, I ain't cuffin' 'em, I'm a dog just like Snoopy
And when I leave the mall, it's sold out, erryday shoppin'
Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches

Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag

It's what I do
Gettin' money is (What I do, falling in love with you)

[Verse 4: Bun B]
Gettin' money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' breakups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See, ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

Felt a little less pressure from you
And I’m here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured
[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever

[Bridge: Florence Welch]
You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on her left titty
[Chorus: Florence Welch]
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever

Why you always treat me like I owe some?
Truthfully you only wanna hold some
Whip it like I've been a slave
Bucking from the twelve like I've been afraid

Kept a pre-paid on my hip them days

From the cradle to the grave, put in work
Hustled 'round the corner where my nana stay, couldn't work

Tryna find home, next stop is the Waldorf
Past the racism and fake-ism

They throwin' mad salt 'til I go bath salt
On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off

Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh

Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer

Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it on plenty

Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the Henny, it's the best for the remedies

Food getting lower, money coming slower
Damn land lord keep bitching cause you owe her

And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive
Then I hit the stage, all gone and blazed
Everybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Living life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up quick so I feel like B.I.G
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change, niggas feel a little strange

The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch

Young man, brotha brotha, you gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', gotta understand, gotta make the plays
Stick to it, get through, write yours, ride your wave, just keep it true
We'll fight the blues, we'll fight the blues
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha man, brotha man
You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but
I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[Chorus: French Montana]
When I went to my brotha, told him, ""Help me please""
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', ""Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (Come back) come back (Come back)
Come back (Come back) babe""

Harlem nights, quick speed, Godspeed
Speed of light, Grease Lightnin', leather on my six-speed bike
Bicycle tires, icicle diamonds, popsicle stripes

Pop-pop wheelies on the dirty bikes, 15 sellin' China white
Cops stoppin' if you opposite of white
Pop, pop like you opposite of right
Take heed, lil' nigga, lowkey, take lead on them niggas

Flacko, I wonder how it feel to live or be like you
Album number three and keep it G like Q
Heard you niggas get fly like G, like 2
Nah, more like 4, like 3, not 2
Shittin' on these niggas like P, like U
Drip Raheem and Q, got Hi-C like juice
Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you
That's why I got a beam with a green light too
I don't even make a scene, I just swing right through
I'm just stayin' on my Qs and my Ps like soup
Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

A couple white lines
A cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio

Wasted, high on the West Side Highway
Drunk enough to fuck with, face it

Shame on her, make up or get a makeover
Think over, Glenfiddich start to takeover
When I brainstorm, all the hoes ain't got a thing on her
Audemars, season order like summer fall
I throw the Audemars, then I throw out all the ball
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Little cutie pie, saw her looking super fly
More Justin Timberlake on my suit and tie
Try to scrutinize, cause I keep two inside
Suicides? No sir, hoes get the Uber ride
Or we can kiss 'til the sun come up
Or, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up
She ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge
Girl just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up

Yo, ASAP here
We 'bout to kill a fucking game
You know who the fuck we are
You know my motherfucking name
I fucked your dame
And she bought me a chain
And a range
And a pinky ring, bling, bling
And all my niggas here, they about to kill this shit
What you say Nast?

[Verse 1: ASAP Nast]
Hold up dog, Nast in this bitch again
Sipping Hen, staring at that white girl from Michigan
She was with a friend, fat ass fly ho
I went in for the kill, ASAP, pronto
So wait boo, 'fore we hit your condo
Got another friend with me named Whitney from Chicago
Whitney love ta model? I'm thinkin' ménage
The truck parked out from, the Chevy get Ta-hoes
Haters all in my face, can't see, blindfold
? on my feet, blew right by folks
Stuntin' on sucker niggas is what I was designed for
Dead fresh, fresh to death, I should have designed clothes
But I'm blessing these tracks, sick flow, swine flu
Y'all ain't fucking with Nast, I been nice, y'all knew
Haha, nigga that shit times two
I'm who your bitches wanna kick it with, kung-fu
But what, dog? What is you saying?
Nast in this bitch, ho, why is you playing?
Like I won't slay this stage on some gang shit?
Turn into a mayhem, beat hard, flow hurtin
Cali swag bitch, snapback, no jerkin'
Fuck work, fuck money in hands, hoes know this
Fast forward, past focus, I'm that on it
One of the best to do, I think not, you bet on it
Giant ass you be lumberjack Paul Bunyon
Hoes love it, lover never put none above it
Wanna hug me tighter than jeans ass sportin'
Carry corpses to cemeteries, that's very often
Sport fortune, Matchboxes, that awesome
[Verse 2: SpaceGhostPurrp]
So what I say, motherfucker
Already know I never been a sucker
See I lust ya, I want ya
Baby come home, babygirl, what's your name, Wanda?
Do you wanna get up on me?
Do you wanna bend over?
Do you feel horny?
Do you wanna feel the stroke?
It's kind of like Facebook when you feel a poke
ASAP, no joke
Raider Klan, all back and we aiming at your throat

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
I wanna rock but the bitches want me, though
D&G briefs fit a nigga like a Speedo
Skinny nudie jeans, though
Boots be 40 below
He flow, 100 degrees, the jewels zero
Rockstar rap, he reps Guitar Hero
Leopard Louboutins like Speedo on Steve-O
Charge me on the game, couldn't pause me on Tivo
Beyonce, the Kanye, I got a big ego
On to that next shit, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game, treat you niggas like my stepkids
Pull up in a Porsche, niggas get nausea
Didn't write the rules but my status like the author
Just crashed the range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in the penthouse
Swagging on you maggot and I'm about to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next ones, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to the shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon need an order of protection
Killin Feelin all these records so my charges is molesting
An assault with deadly weapons, got these rappers feeling threatened
A hip-hop veteran, I'm a hip-hop felon
[Verse 4: ASAP Twelvy]
It's a war going on outside and we started it
Believe that or die, nigga, on some martyr shit
All my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit
And we came to double up on that Harlem shit
We all eating, this is how it's supposed to go
Stop speaking, this is how you supposed to flow
The ins and out, never a winner's route
I never lose again, it's like every day I lose a friend
To some dumb shit, whore and dumb bitch
So a hating nigga, whore cuff wrists
I know a lot of niggas sitting in a cell now
For the shit I've done, I'm probably even hell-bound
But it's cool with me, jacking niggas' jewelry
I don't give a fuck about your foolery
Nigga keep a tool with me just to blast at you bitches
Marvelous at the top and our rags to the riches

On my Pokemon shit, you already know...
I said, I said, I said
I swear to God I want it all
He gon' give it to me back
And get on top above it all

And once I get these many bitches, swear to God I'm in

Henny, and I'm out here and my dad was in bed
So I down a whole bottle on that bitch with the mink

And I'm tweaked, like a nerve
And I'm smart, like a nerd
Guess that's why my last name Ferg
Okay I'm glidin' like a fucking bird

Now you want to know the deadline on some Project shit

See my bitch ride that big thing, you on that little shit
Trying to make noise, you squeaking like a little pig
Put her into that dog, my attitude's a little Vick
[Verse 6: ASAP Rocky]
Next time my niggas fall back
ASAP Raider Klan and we all blacked out
Tell that bitch get it mapped out
And I fucked a bitch, now she flat out
Chest out, on the fucking floor, never hit it raw
Got a condom and I got a towel by the door
Just in case the smoke go into the hallways
Cause I be smoking weed and fucking all day
This is off the top of the dome, let me introduce my niggas before a nigga go home
We got Ty Beats, the illest producer in the streets
You know he come through with that motherfucking heat
Got Twelvy, motherfucking Twelvy, got a bad bitch, Jewish named Shelby
Got my nigga Nast in the back
Got a snapback to the back, he don't even know how to act
Got my nigga named Purrp, Spaceghostpurrp, do your bitch real dirt

I could bag your girl in a broken down Chevrolet
Swag do the talkin', I ain't even gotta decorate
I was 21 when I bought my mom a condo
A guitar and a gift card down at Costco's
It's a cold winter when it's blowing past my goggles
Penthouse, top floor, window with the gargoyle
Performance down at Santos, Phantom suicide doors
Paparazzi slide-shows, showers with the slide doors
One night, five shows, two-seater, five hoes
Eyes closed, I can see them hating through the blindfolds
Niggas better switch it if the business ain't the convo
I'm all about my chicken nigga you could call me Roscoe's
If I wasn't spitting I'd be probably flipping waffles
I suppose God knows I coulda been a snot-nose

When you don't drink champagne but you orderin' cases

Got all white neighbors and most of 'em racist

Couldn't afford shit, but always was attracted to fly shit

It's Paul Wall, come on

[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Purple pint, that's Gucci rap
Driving slow, black on black
Backwood lit, windows cracked
Dime in my lap with her hair pulled back
And a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist
Mouth full of ice, pardon my lisp
World full of hate is fear a few rips
So I open my mind and stack up my chips
Lollipop grind, whole lotta licks
From paper planes to a house made of bricks
Big ol' cold cup with codeine mix
So I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit
And everything is purple, baby

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Trill OG and I rep the South
Nigga, I rep the streets and I rep the hood
And I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains
And I'm flippin' mane so it's pretty good
I'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it
Hittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it
With a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece
‘Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie
Haters better get they ass behind me, homie
‘Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge
And when I'm done, I'mma have a homie run
And they be hard to find like they's El Debarge
And my swag is large, extra large
I can barely fit it up in this room
But don't sweat the size and don't be surprised
When your bitch reminds that I'm the shit to swoon
I lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro
Spit my game and I smash your ho
But no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough
Then I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro
I got a passion for this Southern flow
This that purple life and we thuggin', bro
These haters might not really understand it
But that's all good ‘cause we love it though
This PAT, that's where I'm from
That's what I rep and that's how it go
I roll with rocks so get up off the jock
From New York to PA, this that purple flow
It's that swag
[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed
That purple swag, purple swag, that purple smoke up in my clothes
That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow
I got these boppas going crazy, they see me comin'
Robitussin, quit discussin', A$AP, tell these niggas somethin'

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
I said, everything is purple (Swag)
Everything is purple (Swag, swag, swag)

Check, one, two, what it do?
Run it!
[Verse 4: Killa Kyleon]
Fo's spinnin' like the shit under my wave cap
Just rock it like a nigga named ""A$AP""
Fast money man, I get mine ASAP
Always stacking and I'm paid, that's ASAP
Wood grippin', candy drippin'
Four in my 20, I'm candy sippin'
Fill my prescription, I'm leanin', ho
Nightmare cup, I'm dreamin', ho
Trill nigga like Chad and Bun B
Crocodile seats insides, I'm Dundee
Slow that down, Screw, Watts or Ron C
I'm getting rap money but I used to run D
MC, rep, run it
Frank Castle shit, any beat get punished
Y'all got problems, I get money
So my neck, fist, wrist always look sunny
I stay fresh, y'all niggas look bummy
Cold with the flow, so I ball like Tommy
Martin, I keep a yellow bone like Gina
Thick like Serena, my pockets on Venus, nigga!

Cause we been getting, we’ve been getting high all week
Smoking, drinking, I’m her drug and she get high off me

Roll it back in that Backwood
Pass it and smoke

Nowadays it's silly, niggas beef for nothing
The type of shit that make the hippies throw up peace for nothing
Back in my day, there wasn't silencers to hide the 8 up
So if it's beef, be sure to order side of baked potato
I've got amigos on my payroll, Quavo gave me guelo
Fuego, beef up on my plate is no mistake
Hahahahaha, check out the Chopard
For sure, I'm Shakur out the window of my car
Spitting at the cameras and I flood the club with dancers
I used to roll with hammers back when Sway had all the answers
Now it's spread like cancers in this German
And these niggas want me gone for certain
And that's what I call beef, you vermin

Then I scratch that kitty word to my K-9's
Don't spur show fur big grill gleaming

That's another reason, to only let the freak in (Where you at?)
That type of action, happen every third weekend (Where you at?)
Took all type of trips, 'til my mileage got frequent (I got free flights this year)
Shit, and my proposals came indecent
She musta told her friends cause I here 'em ki-ki'ing
(I saw your girlfriend last night) About this money and V's that we be in
We getting money new V's each season (What's this fall?)
The champagne caught me, vision kind of sloppy (Who that?)
Kickin' it to this broad but my speech is kind of choppy
I told her let's split, her reply was copied
So when a nigga split, you know we jump up in the high V
Damn, I think she caught an orgasm
This gold diggin bitch caught a whore spasm (Nasty)
I’m a cold nigga bitch and I the Porsche spazzing
You know the Porsche waggon, four door cabin (I'm on him)
I’m getting money so of course I’m braggin (Count that)
I had the bitch high like she was on saturn (Nah, you aight, baby)
But they get confused with my thought patterns
While we smoking blunts by the port landing4Embed"

Smoking killer grippin' grain
Out my mind I'm so insane
Finest fabrics on my back
Bally kicks, Birkin Jeans
Smoking killer grippin' grain
Out my mind I'm so insane
Finest fabrics on my back
Bally kicks, Birkin Jeans

[Verse 1: Seth Narley]
Smoking killer grippin' grain
Out my mind I'm so insane
Finest fabrics on my back
Bally kicks, Birkin Jeans
Clean with a dirty swing
Catch me with a bony thing
Louboutin everything
Engaged but no wedding ring
Type of woman I attract
Cheetah print all on the back
Sexy motherfucker you
Love how you be switching that
LA by way of New York
She tell me she love my talk
I tell her I love her walk
The way she bought without a card
Got me 'bout to set it off
Hit a bank up like Latifa, yeah that type of set it off
Favorite show the Commodores, minds is more like entourage
I be playing Vinnie Chase and mama get her Sasha on
Cutting till the break of dawn
Then I'm off, on the road, probably to another show
Different city, newer clothes
Different ho, a different stroke
Fuck you mean I'm gnarly Joe
My old head put me on the game
Keep it pimpin' never fold
So I spit it, here it go

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I do the Raf Simons she ain't even heard of it
The situation looking flaky then I'm curvin' it
Condo out in Jersey, I ain't even furnished it
That's a sub-lease that lease ain't even permanent
Asap tat is on a nigga permanent
Long hair a nigga might just throw a perm in it
Maserati ridin' catch a nigga swervin' in
I'm moving fast, you can't catch up to my turbulence
Smoking lemon kush, yeah I'm eating good
I see the limit push, and I'ma leave for good
L-lil mama lookin' she heard I eat it good
They call me Hollywood, but I'm a keep it hood
Na-na-now I came down south, niggas know I keep it banging
Good whip, keep it ringing
Keep the wood grain I'm slangin'
4's and tippin' Nothing different
And we on that codeine promethazine the same thing
And it made my nose bleed

Mister Frankenstein
Oh, Victor Frankenstein (Ooh)

Igor by my side (Ooh)
That's right, I made you slime (Ooh)
Tyler, create you guys, never mind (Uh)
I bet you hate that line (Woo)
That's death to everybody in my class
Columbine (Woo), pay me in decimals (Uh)
Comma signs, dollar signs
Baby, pay me no mind
'Cause I'm outta mine, these niggas outta line (Uh)
Iced out pendant, Jesus
Iced out cross, missed out on church last weekend
Ice to his chain, now the charges pending
Know that I'ma sin, lord forgive us (Woo)
I'ma go to church next Christmas
I remember that-that Thank-Thanksgiving
When we was eatin' Church's Chicken, man ain't that somethin'
It made me who I am I don't take back shit bitch
So ungrateful
Remember who raised you
Don't bite the hand that feed you
Be the same hand that pays you (Woo)
So ungrateful
I'ma make these boys act thankful
Like they forget that they need you
Most of these hoes unfaithful
So ungrateful
Don't remember who raised you
Bite the hand that feeds you
Be the hand that pay you, bitch
So unfaithful, I'mma make these boys act thankful
It's like they forget that they need you
Most of these hoes unfaithful (Uh)
So ungrateful, boy you forget who raised you
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Most of these hoes unfaithful
What's going on?

You better call the law
They got a styrofoam cup, but where your soda boy?
Now, I'm in my bag, can't forget my past, focus on my path
They gon' feel my wrath
Please don't touch my, please don't touch my
Kiss my ass, then collect my thoughts, then collect my debt
Oh where the guns?

In the moshpit, I'm finna fuck up shit
