And when you popped off on your ex he deserved it

Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out

Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touching road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else

Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip

Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
[Verse 3: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it
If I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker
That's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we can really get it, we can go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it

Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
They ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
Askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
[Outro: James Blake]
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

[Spoken Intro: Jimmy Smith]
Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

[Chorus: Timbaland]
Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik

Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog
You know it's real when you are who you think you are

Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel

Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do

And since you pick up, I know he's not around, oh, oh

I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flight's in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just callin' 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in there mixed up
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry

Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?

And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

You not gon' come?
I guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, ""You niggas crazy,"" I hope no one heard that
Yeah, I hope no one heard that

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: Drake]
All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
[Pre-Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?

Promise to break everybody off before I break down
Everyone just wait now, so much on my plate now

These days, I'm lettin' God handle all things above me
The things I can't change are the reason you love me
Listen, you can hear them callin' my name
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place
I'm not ashamed at all
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed
That, or it never existed
Whenever they say somethin' 'bout us, you listen
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline
That's cuttin' all into my time with you

She said, ""You're my everything""
""I love you through everything""
I done did everything to her
She forgave me for everything
This a ""forever"" thing
Hate that I treat it like it's a ""whatever"" thing
Trust me, girl, this shit is everything to me
She from the jungle

Yeah, these days, these new girls, they got me nervous
They go to school and do bottle service
They can't decide, they keep switchin' majors
Being indecisive makes me anxious
Call your number and it's out of service
Who can I call for your information?
What am I supposed to do after we done everything that we done?
Who is your replacement?

How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
'Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself, ""Why do you worry?""
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

[Verse 1: Drake]
I think I killed everybody in the game last year
Man, fuck it, I was on, though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at the strip club
Mmm-mmm, fuck it, I was wrong, though
Shout out to all my niggas livin' tax-free
Nowadays, it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim some
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from
Yeah, you know me well, nigga, yeah
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal, nigga
Slave to the pussy, but I'm just playin' the field, nigga, yeah
Are these people really discussin' my career again?
Askin' if I'll be goin' platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man, all of your flows bore me, paint dryin'
And I don't ever be trippin' off of what ain't mine
And I be hearin' the shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time, yeah
It's been that way from the beginnin'
I just been playin', I ain't even notice I was winnin'
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright
[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, I know you don't love me, baby
They're trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body
[Verse 2: Drake]
You say I'm old news, well, who the new star?
'Cause if I'm goin' anywhere, it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the States
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over fed time
But shout out to the niggas that's doin' dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggas that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart, boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you your start, boy
Oh, you wanna be a motherfuckin' funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin Hart, boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feelin' good, livin' better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin' the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it
And I was drinkin' at the Palms last night
And ended up losin' everything that I came with, yeah
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

Motherfucker never loved us
Fucker never loved us
You ain't know, now you know now
Still at it, scrub J's with a toothbrush
Shit, niggas still playing my old shit
But your shit is like the police askin' us questions
Nigga, we don't know shit
Flexin'—nigga, I'm just flexin'
Nigga never loved us
Do it look like we stressin'?
Look at you, look at you and look at you
Aww, I'm glad that they chose us
'Cause, man, it's a mission
Tryna fight to the finish just to see, am I finished?

[Chorus]
On my worst behavior, no?
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
Remember? Motherfucker
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't you ever get it fucked up

Man, motherfuckers never loved us

Hold up, hold my phone
Motherfuckers never loved us
Fucker never loved us
Now you want to roll one
Motherfucker never loved us
So everywhere we go now, full cup
Always hated the boy, but now the boy is the man
Motherfucker, I done growed up
You know me? You know me?
I'm liable to do anything when it comes to that you owe me
You owe me, you owe me
Bitch, you better have my money when I come for that shit like O.D.B

[Verse 3]
Who's hot, who not?
Tell me, who rock, who sell out in stores?
You tell me who flop, who copped the new drop
Whose jewels got rocks
Who else making rap albums, doing numbers like it's pop?
Same old pimp, Drake, you know ain't nothin' changed
With these funny style niggas, we done put on in the game
I just ask for some blessings at my grandmother's grave
Then it's back to L.A., open the mail, starin' at the check
Enough to make you throw up, man, it's gross what I net
I'm with my whole set, tennis matches at the crib
I swear I could beat Serena when she playin' with her left
Oh, where I reside it look like a resort inside
Nigga, where your shit from? I imported mine
Bar mitzvah money like my last name Mordecai
Fuck you, bitch, I'm more than high
My momma probably hear that and be mortified
This ain't the son you raised who used to take the Acura
5 a.m. then go and shoot Degrassi up on Morningside
For all the stuntin', I'll forever be immortalized
Yeah, back and forth across the borderline
Hate to leave the city, but I've got to do the overtime
Gone all the time, even the important times
I should let you know ahead I'm comin' back on my worst behavior

Remember?
Hold up, hold my phone
They used to never want to hear us
Remember? Motherfucker never loved us

Playing dirty not clean
Out in front of Four Seasons
Looking like a damn football team
All in the same thing
All repping one thing
Looking for revenge

[Verse 1: Drake]
To do what you couldn't do
Tell Obama that my verses are just like the whips that he in
They bulletproof
Minus twenty we in Pitfield
That Kai's kitchen in a Canada Goose
Famous as fuck but I’m still in the cut when they round up the troops
I’m just a sicko, a real sicko when you get to know me nigga
I let the diss record drop, you was staying right below me, nigga
We must have played it a hundred times, you was going to bed
Why would I put on a vest? I expect you to aim for the head
I coulda killed you the first time
You don’t have to try and say it louder nigga
Trust, we heard you the first time
It’s nothing personal I would have done it to anyone
And I blame where I came from
And I blame all my day ones
You know Chubbs like Draymond
You better off not saying nothing
Them boys they a handful
Then I hit ‘em with the Hotline
Chris Breezy with the dance moves
Mo-G with the dance moves
Ave Boy with the dance moves
Jimi Hendrix with the solo
Those are strings that you can’t pull
Yeah, and I could really dish it out
Come and get it from the source
Fuck with all the word of mouth
Golden State running practice at my house
Nigga, what am I about?
You gon’ really feel it now
I’m out here…

[Verse 2: Drake]
All you boys in the new Toronto want to be me a little
All your exes know I like my O’s with a V in the middle
You would love it if I went away or didn’t say nothing else
How am I keeping it real by keeping this shit to myself?
You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake
Say you seeing ‘bout it when you see me man y’all never home anyway
Thought of things that you shoulda said, said things that you shouldn’t say
We even gave y'all the whole money play and y'all broke to this day
“Oh it’s your time now” yeah, that’s what everybody say
I used to wanna be on Roc-A-Fella then I turned into Jay
Now I got a house in LA, now I got a bigger pool than Ye
And look man, Ye’s pool is nice, mine's just bigger's what I’m saying
I’m that nigga’s what I’m saying
Getting things done around here
How you let me run it down here?
I’m not even from around here
Six, six, six, six, six, soon as I’m back in the city they throw a parade
I might get a key to the city and give it to Wayne
Or give it to one of the young boys to carry the wave
Yeah, so trust me, they’ll be out here…

I don't know why they been lyin' but your shit is not that inspirin'
Bank account statement just look like I'm ready for early retirement
Fuck any nigga that's talking that shit just to get a reaction
Fuck going platinum, I look at my wrist and it's already platinum
I am the kid with the motor mouth
I am the one you should worry 'bout
I don't know who you're referring to
Who is this nigga you heard about?
Someone just talking that bullshit
Man, someone just gave you the run-around
Niggas downplayin' the money
But that's what you do when the money down
I don't waste time puttin' money down
I just go straight to who got it and buy it in cash
Pussy so good that you gotta come see me on tour
And you gotta fly in first class
This has been years in the makin'
It's all for the city, they know I come right every summer
Cash Money Records forever, I'm always big timin'
Bitch, I came up right under Stunna, you know it
[Chorus: Drake]
Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well
Been ready, it's real, I don't know about you
She just want to smoke and fuck
I said, ""Girl, that's all that we do""
Okay, now you're talkin' my language

And fuck it, man, no one's invited
I got to kill off the weak shit that's got all you niggas excited
I can't even listen, you wildin'
I'd much rather sit here in silence
I send all my money to banks in the islands
And eat with Italians, I do
People are funny
You don't even know 'bout the shit that I been through
I just want some head in a comfortable bed
It could all be so simple
Talkin' that shit with your back to me
Just know it always get back to me
Come get your girl
She been here for three days and she way too attached to me
Hate when they get too attached to me
I got to get on the bus and get back on the road
Get what I can out the country
And then I just get on the jet and go back to the cold
Can't even drive with the top off
Been workin' so hard on the album, I missed the whole summer
I just might bring in some girls from Miami to heat up the city
And that's word to Stunna, you know it

Jealousy in the air tonight, I could tell
I will never understand that, but oh well

I need someone I leave through the front door with
'Cause we don't wanna hide no more

Done sayin' I'm done playin'
Last time was on the outro
Stuck in the house, need to get out more
I've been stackin' up like I'm fundraising
Most people in my position get complacent
Wanna come places with star girls
And they end up on them front pages
I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it
I'm the only one that's putting shots up
And like a pot luck, you need to come with it, don't run from it
Like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it one hundred
Met a lot of girls in my times there
Word to Paul Wall, not one fronted
I was birthed there in my first year
Man, I know that place like I come from it
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like, ""Is Bun coming?
Fuck that, is anyone comin'
'Fore I show up there and there's no one there?""
These days, I could probably pack it
For like twenty nights if I go in there
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out
Talkin' to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now
Talkin' to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out
She tell me, ""Take a deep breath
You're too worried about being the best out""

Uh, someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods
Money got my whole family going backwards
No dinners, no holidays, no nothin'
There's issues at hand that we're not discussin'

My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list
And now he's actin' like, ""Oh, well, this is life, I guess""
Nah, fuck that shit
Listen, man, you can still do what you wanna do
You gotta trust that shit
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign
That's when they appear
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here
I hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment
Telling herself that she's too sick to get dressed up and go do shit
Like that's true shit
And all my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round
Started treating me like I'm ""him"" now
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!

[Verse 1: Drake]
Look, I just flipped a switch (Flipped, flipped)
I don't know nobody else that's doin' this
Bodies start to drop, ayy (Hit the floor)
Now they wanna know me since I hit the top, ayy
This a Rollie, not a stopwatch, shit don't ever stop
This the flow that got the block hot, shit got super hot, ayy
Give me my respect (Give me my respect)
I just took it left like I'm ambidex'
Bitch, I move through London with the Eurostep (Two)
Got a sneaker deal and I ain't break a sweat
Catch me 'cause I'm gone (Outta there, I’m gone)
How I go from 6 to 23 like I'm LeBron?
Servin' up a pack (Servin' up a pack)
Niggas pullin' gimmicks 'cause they scared to rap, ayy
Funny how they shook, ayy, got these niggas shook
Pullin' back the curtain by myself, take a look, ayy
I'm a bar spitta, I’m a hard hitta
Yeah I’m light-skinned, but I'm still a dark nigga
I'm a wig splitta, I'm a tall figure
I'm an unforgivin' wild-ass dog nigga
Somethin' wrong with 'em, got 'em all bitter
I'm a bill printer, I'm a gravedigger
Yeah, I am what I am
I don't have no time for no misunderstandings again
[Chorus: Mack Daddy Ju & Drake]

Future took the business and ran it for me
I let Ollie take the owl, told him brand it for me
I get 2 million a pop and that’s standard for me
Like I went blind, dog, you gotta hand it to me
(Gotta gimme that shit, dog)
Prayed, then I prayed again (Amen, Lord)
Had a moment but it came and went
(They don't love you no more)
You don’t wanna play with him (Nah, nah, nah)
They’ll be mournin' you like 8AM (R.I.P.)
Pinky ring 'til I get a wedding ring (Whoa, yeah)
Love my brothers, cut 'em in on anything (Big slice)
And you know it's King Slime Drizzy, damn (Woo yeah)
She just said I'm bae, I hit the thizzle dance (Mac Dre shit)
Either hand is the upper hand (Oh yeah, shit)
Got a bubba on my other hand (Whoa, yeah, shit, yeah)
This shit ain't no hundred bands (Nah, nah, nah, nah)
Palace look like Buckingham
Bills so big, I call 'em Williams, for real
Reasons to go crazy, got a trillion, for real
They been tryin' me but I'm resilient, for real
I can’t go in public like civilian, for real
And I hardly take offense
Money for revenge, man, that’s hardly an expense
Al Haymon checks off of all of my events
I like all the profit, man, I hardly do percents (I don't do that shit)
A big part of me resents
Niggas that I knew from when I started in this shit
They see what I got and, man, it's hard to be content
Fuck what they got goin' on, I gotta represent (Ayy!)

Regret got shit on what you're feelin' now
Mad 'cause he ain't like me
Oh, you mad 'cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take
All the love that we made
Now you're trying to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alisha, Catya, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah, I said it
Bitch, I'm the man, don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you got your hair up, did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now, that's me
That's me
And the voice in your ear, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah, I made it
First I made you who you are and then I made it
And you're wasted with your latest
Yeah, I'm the reason why you always gettin' faded

[Verse 2]
Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says, ""I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewin' things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And all your friends tellin' you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all the images of your Mr. Perfect
I could tell that you been cryin' all night, drinkin' all summer
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved

'Cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day
Had fans, but you let 'em down
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down

I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' round

I got a 150,000 dollars for an afterparty
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down
Bring us up, I never take us down
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down
Fake fucked with me back then

On my way, money taught me Spanish, make it andale
Way up north, packed in Honda cars
They don't know who we are
Fuck 'em all, they only pussy niggas shootin' at the star

On some DMX shit
I group DM my exes
I tell 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever
And I think we just get closer when we not together
You tell me that I'm confusin'
More immature than Marques Houston
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution
We too deep in this thing, you'll never lose me
LOLOL, I'm glad you find this shit amusin'
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars
That's why she always correctin' me when my time is off
And my house is the definition
Of alcohol and weed addiction
You got a different vision
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen
Without runnin' into one of my niggas
That's not the way we livin'
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people
But every time we speakin'

It's like a lot of games bein' played
How's it goin' down?
If it's on 'til we gone, then I gots to know now
Is you wit' me or what?

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs
Where you're getting me
All that grey in our conversation history, you
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things
Playin' mime games, we both doin' the same thing
Slide on a late night
You like to slide on a late night
You sent a ""Are you here?"" text without an invite
That's that shit that I don't like
We both slide on a late night
Do things in our off time
We both, yeah
Made some mistakes, pon road
Yeah, how's that for real?
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal
3 dots, you thinkin' of a reaction still
While you're typin', make sure you tell me

Yeah, remember you was livin' at The London for a month
Service elevator up to 4201
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front
Girl, I had your back when all you used to do was front
That's for sure though, I made a career off reminiscin'
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade they throwin'
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need
And on my way to make this dough
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
A lot of niggas cut the check so they can take this flow
Ohhh, ohhh

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)

Then she wanna ask when it got so empty
Tell her I apologize, happened over time
She says, ""They miss the old Drake,"" girl, don't tempt me
""If they don't get it, they'll be over you
That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings
Soap-opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that
'Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know

[Chorus]
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head, it's disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

[Verse 1]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho
Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin' what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991 (One, one, one)
Outta town, people love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggas askin' if I'm cool

[Chorus]
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Hunnid thousand on my head, it's disrespect (Disrespect)
So offended that I had to double check
[Verse 2]
You tryna check?
This is real life, niggas think we playin' chess
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin' less
End up gettin' loose and gettin' pictures from my ex (Ex, ex, ex, ex)
SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (Skrr)
Why you keep on shootin' if you know that nigga dead? (Skrr)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect

[Refrain]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go fifty-fifty with no ho (Ayy, ayy)
Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin' on a front (Front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin'?

[Chorus]
I'm upset ('Set, 'set)
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
'Least it makes me feel like someone tried their best, yeah
Want to waste a half a million, be my guest
Made me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (Skrr)
But I'm blessed, I just checked (Checked, checked)
Hate me, never met me in the flesh (Flesh)
Said she's got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left (Left, left, left)

Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (For my soul)

You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? (Yours)

A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us

Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend, I want it all to be for you, oh

Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
'Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days (Trippin')
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry"" (How you do?)
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga, it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
'Cause you got the Batphone and my work line
You should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days, but oh (Yeah)

When a good thing goes bad, it's not the end of the world
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl
And she's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting
And it's all because she don't want things to change

[Chorus]
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you
That's the wrong thing to do
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you
That's the wrong thing to do
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you
That's the wrong thing to do
'Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying
And say, ""I love you too""

But I need someone different

We live in a generation of not being in love and not being together
But we sure make it feel like we're together
'Cause we're scared to see each other with somebody else

This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland

Yeah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, ""Your lyrics do shit for me""
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

Silence keeps cloudin' me
Hand on my heart
And I, I wish time never mattered
[Verse: Drake]
Yeah, stylin’ though
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though
All the things you need, you still want problems though
All the things I know, I still been silent though
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes
I don't want to have to go to funerals
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio
I don't have no time to be no Romeo
All the love I need is at the rodeo
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do
Steady doin' double shifts
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click
More blessings because I'm generous
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights
But you can rest assured that my mind is right
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days
Never stick around to see shit change
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin'
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz'
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense
Especially people that want to lecture me
And frame it like they just want the best for me
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up
So there's more for them and there's less for me
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me
No one's done it successfully
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me
You overnight celebrity, you one day star
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me
There's real ones around me
I want to make sure they learn from me
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency
My life is centered 'round competition and currency
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me
I'll be back 2018 to give you the summary

[Verse 1]
It's like '09 in your basement and I'm in love with Nebby
And I still love her, but it fell through because I wasn't ready
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt and you smokin' heavy
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly
And then you ash it, and we argue about spendin' money on bullshit
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button, you push it
Now it's fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat
And I leave out and you call me and you tell me that you sorry
And you love me and I love you and your heart hurts, mine does too
And it's just words and they cut deep, but it's our world, it's just us two
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard if you were healthy and it weren't so bad, uh
Maybe I should walk up the street
And try and get a job at the bank
'Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks
We'll probably end up robbin' a bank
Then Wayne calls up my phone
Conversation wasn't that long
Gets me a flight to Houston in the morning
Oh, it's my time, yeah, it's on
He's thinkin' of signin' me, I come home
We make a mixtape with seventeen songs
And almost get a Grammy off of that thing
They love your son, man, that boy gone
You get the operation you dreamed of
And I finally send you to Rome
And get to make good on my promise
It all worked out, girl, we should've known
'Cause you deserve it

Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'
When you're stressed out and you need somethin', I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've, look what you've

It's like '06 in your backyard, I'm in love with Jade
And I'm still in love 'cause when it's that real is when it doesn't fade
And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn
Boohoo, sad story, Black American dad story
Know that I'm your sister's kid, but it still don't explain the love that you have for me
I remember sneaking in your pool after school dances
Damn, your house felt like the Hamptons
For all of my summer romances
I never really had no one like you, man, this all new shit
Made the world I know bigger
Changed the way that I viewed it
Had all this fightin' going on at the crib
You would calm me down when I lose it
Told you I think I'm done acting
Now I'm more in touch with the music
You said, either way, I'd be a star, I could go so far
Talked to me, then you got to me
Then you'd toss the keys and loan me your car, yeah
Just a young kid in a drop-top Lexus hopin' that I don't get arrested
Just another kid that's going through life so worried that I won't be accepted
But I could do anything
You said that, and you meant that
You took me places, you spent that
They said no, we went back
Checks bounced, but we bounced back
I put all the money in your accounts back
And I thank you, I don't know where I'd really be without that
It worked out, man, you deserve it
[Chorus]
Is this shit real? Should I pinch you?
After all the things that we been through, I got you, yeah
Look what you've done, look what you've done
Look what you've done for me now, yeah
You knew that I was gon' be somethin'

And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure (Yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure
[Bridge]
How you feel about
Comin' home with a nigga for the night?
If you nervous, hit the lights
I know we only fuckin' out of spite 'cause your man don't
Do you right, do you right
I could fuck you so good, then I hit you with the 9 a.m. in Dallas
Who you like, baby, who you like?

[Verse]
Machine gun raps for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed, just glad to see the city on the map
I just gave the city life, it ain't about who did it first
It's 'bout who did it right, niggas looking like ""Preach""
Open cases on me for a half a million each
I find peace knowing that it's harder in the streets, I know
Luckily I didn't have to grow there
I would only go there 'cause niggas that I know there
I don't know what's getting into me, I just like the rush
When you see your enemy somewhere in the club and you realize
He just not in a position to reciprocate your energy
You ain't ever worried 'cause he's not who he pretends to be
People like Mazin who was a best friend to me
Start to become a distant memory
Things change in that life, and this life started lacking synergy
And fuckin' with me mentally, I think it's meant to be
Yeah, paranoid, always rolling with my mothafuckin' boys
But you gotta understand when it's yours
They don't really leave your ass with a mothafuckin' choice, man
[Chorus]
I, I just love when I'm with you
Yeah, this shit is on ten
We used to be friends, girl, and even back then
You would look at me with no hesitation and you'd tell me, baby
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody and that
What made me think about the game, girl
And how I switched it up with a new thing
Young nigga came through on his Wu-Tang
And nowadays when I ask about who got it
They say it's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, nobody else's
Yeah, this shit belong to nobody
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure (Yeah)
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's yours
That's for sure, that's for sure

You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like I do
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion

Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Drake]
I don't have a fuck to give, I've been moving state to state
In my leather and my Timbs like it's 1998
And my dog Chubby Chub, that's my nigga from the way
On the Eastside of the city, that's where everybody stay
Seem like everybody calling 'cause they want me on their song
It's like every time I touch it I could never do no wrong
When they need a favor from you, man, they don't leave you alone
But I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 1: Drake, Drake & Sampha, Sampha]
Then that phone doesn't ring
When they got everything, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, looking back on it, at least my pride is intact
'Cause we said ""no strings attached"" and I still got tied up in that
Everything that I write is either for her or about her
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her and she know it
The girl that I wanna save is like a danger to my health
Try being with somebody that wanna be somebody else
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself
Don't even know how to help, but I guess that's just the motion, yeah

[Chorus 2: Drake, Drake & Sampha]
She'll probably come around
Soon as I settle down, that's the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion
[Outro: Drake, Sampha]
Nothing less and nothing more
I hear your heart hit the floor
I guess that's just the motion
Talking to you is not enough, no
I guess that’s just the motion
Oh-oh, I guess that's just the motion

Is it the strength of your feelings
Overthrowing your pain?
You'll see new heights you’ll be reaching
And is it today that you will find your new release?
And in your wake, ripple your sweet fate
And more chune for your headtop
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I couldn't get a bill paid
You couldn't buy the real thing
I was stayin’ up at yo' place
Tryin' to figure out the whole thing
I saw people doin' things
Almost gave up on the music thing
But we all so spoiled now
More life, more everything
Must have never had your phone tapped
All that yappin' on the phone shit
You must really love the road life
All that never comin' home shit

I start my day slow
Silk pajamas when I wake though
Miraval to the face though
I drunk text J-Lo
Old number, so it bounce back
Boi-1da got the bounce back
Used to get paid for shows in front-door money
Five, ten, twenties, hand sanitize after you count that
Me and Gibbo was about that
Eatin' Applebee's and Outback
Southwest, no first class
Hilton rooms, gotta double up
Writin’ our name on a double cup
We ain’t even have a tour bus
Girls wouldn't even think of recordin’ me
I fall asleep in sororities
I had some different priorities
Weezy had all the authority
Women I like was ignorin' me
Now they like, ""Aren't you adorable?""
I know the question rhetorical
I took the team plane from Oracle
Mama never used to cook much
Used to chef KD
Now me and Chef, KD
Bet on shots for twenty G's
I brought the game to its knees
I make too much these days to ever say, ""Poor me""
Where you at? I never see you

Please come outside the house and show yourself
So I can say it to your face
It’s bound to happen, man, it's gotta happen now
So let's just get it out the way
Lot of niggas goin' bad on me
Please, one at a time
I wanna move to Dubai
So I don't never have to kick it with none of you guys
I didn't listen to Hov on that old song
When he told me, ""Pay it no mind""
I get more satisfaction outta goin' at your head
And seein' all of you die

I'm in shock
The nerve, the audacity
Okay

[Verse]
So if you rebuke me for workin' with someone else on a couple of Vs
What do you really think of the nigga that's makin' your beats?
I've done things for him I thought that he never would need
Father had to stretch his hands out and get it from me
I pop style for 30 hours then let him repeat
Now you poppin' up with the jokes, I'm dead, I'm asleep
I just left from over by y'all puttin' pen to the sheets
Tired of sittin' quiet and helpin' my enemies eat
Keep gettin' temperature checks
They know that my head overheats
Don't know why the fuck you niggas listen to Denim or Steve
Must've had your Infrared wrong, now your head in the beam
Y'all are the spittin' image of whatever jealousy breeds
Don't push me when I'm in album mode
You're not even top 5 as far as your label talent goes
You send shots, well I got to challenge those
But I bring Calicos to the Alamo
I could never have a Virgil in my circle
And hold him back 'cause he makes me nervous
I wanna see my brothers flourish to they higher purpose
You niggas leeches and serpents
I think it's good that now the teachers are learnin', yeah
Your brother said it was your cousin, then him, then you
So, you don't rap what you did, you just rap what you knew
Don't be ashamed, it's plenty niggas that do what you do
There's no malice in your heart, you're an approachable dude
Man, you might've sold to college kids for Nike and Mercedes
But you act like you sold drugs for Escobar in the '80s
I had a microphone of yours, but then the signature faded
I think that pretty much resembles what's been happenin' lately
Please believe your demise will be televised, yeah
And as for Q, man, I changed his life a couple times
Nigga was at Kroger workin' double time
Y'all actin' like he made the boy when I was tryna help the guy
Yeah, who gassed you to play with me?
Man, you made this shit as easy as ABCs
Whoever supposedly makin' me hits
But then got no hits sound like they need me
My hooks did it, my lyrics did it
My spirit did it, I'm fearless with it, yeah
I really shouldn't have given you none of my time
'Cause you older than the nigga you runnin' behind
Look, holla at me when you multi-million
I told you keep playin' with my name
And I'ma let it ring on you like Virginia Williams
I'm too resilient, get out your feelings
It's gonna be a cruel summer for you
I told Weezy and Baby, ""I'ma done him for you""
Tell 'Ye we got a invoice comin' to you

Them strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin'
All of the talkin', got one reply for all of your comments
Fuck what you think, I'm too busy, that's why you leave a message
Born a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive
That shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure
Like ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort
I piece letters together and get to talkin' reckless
Owl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace
My life's a completed checklist
I'm tired of hearin' 'bout who you checkin' for now
Just give it time, we'll see who's still around a decade from now
That's real

[Verse 3: Drake]
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
Lately I've been feelin' like Guy Pearce in Memento
I just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo
The family all that matters, I'm just out here with my kinfolk
Off everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow
This for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo
I sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna (Talk to 'em)
The fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie
All these nineties fantasies on my mind
The difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time
I might come through without security to check if you're fine
That's just me on my solo like ""Fuck it"", like ""YOLO""
Wanted to tell you, ""Accept yourself""
You don't have to prove shit to no one except yourself
And if you end up needin' some extra help, then I could help
You know, back on your feet and shit
Tryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
How this nigga workin' like he got a fuckin' twin though?
Life is soundin' crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese
And I wouldn't change a thing if you paid me
Now real nigga, wassup?
Ayy, yeah, ayy
How much time is this nigga spendin' on the intro?
[Spoken Outro: Curtis Mayfield]
If there's hell below, I'll see you when you get there
Are you enjoyin' yourselves?
If we may, we would just like to close off with somethin' a bit inspirational
Hopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years
It don't mean that we can't have a good life
So we'd like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us

Rolling swishers, hittin' swishes
Got me feelin' like a ball hog

You too worried 'bout the bitches (What you worried 'bout?)
I got one girl, and she my girl, and nobody else can hit it (Try a ting)
She'll admit it, she'll admit it (Try a ting)
She ain't fuckin' with you niggas
And just like every single other thing in my life
You can have her when I'm finished (Why?)

Ayy, truck to the plane to the truck
Truck to the hotel lobby
Me, I go through underground garages
Presidential suite on deposit
Elevator up to the room
Shower up and then we hit the club
Touch down, gotta see what's up
Area code in my phone
What numbers do I still have?
Who do I know from the past?
Hit one, she say she got a man
Hit another one, it goes green
Must've changed phones on the team
'Member when you let me in between
That was 2017
All good, Chubbs will look around
Find one that seem my type
That my dawg and he know what I like
He done found me plenty in my life
Problem is, I meet a girl tonight
Then I go and treat her too nice
Galleria credit card swipes
I don't even know if she a wife
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
But I do know one thing though
Women, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Jewelry in the safe on arrival
Pistol on J for survival
Lot of people gunnin' for the title
Lot of people tryna take us viral
I'm just tryin' to have a nice night though
Waiter brought the check for the meal
She said, ""Babe, I think there was a typo""
Nah, girl, I got it, that's light though
I could show you bigger things than that
It's gon' be a minute 'til I'm back
Let me give you images that last
AMEX had a limit in the past
I had plenty women in the past
I done plenty sinnin' in the past
You don't need to know, but you can ask
Stickin' on your backstage pass
All access 'cause you bad
You could go wherever with that ass
Show to the shower to the truck
Truck to the club for the party
You go in first with your girls
'Cause I don't know who's out there watchin'

Stop, stop, stop…
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up
I’m so sorry
Did you hope I was crying?
It was rough without you
It was rough without you

[Verse 1]
I did some charity today for the kids
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him
I’m charged up, I’m charged up

[Verse 2]
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged
I’m flattered, man, in fact, I’m amazed
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it?
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it?
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it
None of them want this shit more than I want it
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin'
Done doin' favors for people
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold
Turnin' into some so-and-sos that no one knows
But so it go
Come live all your dreams out at OVO
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe
No woman ever had me star-struck
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up
I’m charged up
Oh no, we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us
I'm charged up
[Verse 3]
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later
While these boys was stanky leggin'
Trust me, this information is vital
I’m tryin' to take the high road, I still got love for my idols
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die
We goin' live to keep this shit alive
Cops are killin' people with they arms up
And your main focus is tryna harm us?
And you think you ‘bout to starve us?
Niggas ain’t about to starve us
Nah, I’m charged up!

[Outro]
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…)
Have you seen me? I’m doing so good
Every time we meet: ""Oh, I’m so sorry""
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
[Sample]
""You know, I kept it real
It ain’t too many real people out here
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long
Industry people… regular people…
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak.""837Embed"

You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

Know you got a roommate, call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

Don't link me
Don't hit me when you hear this and tell me your favorite song
Don't tell me how you knew it would be like this all along
I know the truth is you won't love me until I'm gone
And even then the thing that comes after is movin' on
I can't even capture the feeling I had at first
Meetin' all my heroes like seein' how magic works
The people I look up to are goin' from bad to worse
Their actions out of character even when they rehearse
Workin' in the land of the free, the home of the brave
I gotta bring my brothers or else I feel out of place
Breakin' speed records on roads that these niggas paved
And they don't like that, it's written all on they face
I don't know how I'ma make it out of here clean
Can't even keep track of who plays for the other team
Iconic duos rip and split at the seams
Good-hearted people are takin' it to extremes
Leavin' me in limbo to question what I believe
Leavin' me to ask what's their motive in makin' peace
Leavin' me to not trust anybody I meet
Leavin' me to ask, is there anybody like me?

[Verse 2: Drake]
Missin' out on my years
There's times when I wish I was where I was
Back when I used to wish I was here
Missin' out on my days
Scrollin' through life and fishin' for praise
Opinions from total strangers take me out of my ways
I try and see who's there on the other end of the shade
Most times it's just somebody that's underaged
That's probably just alone and afraid
And lashin' out so that someone else can feel they pain
I always hear people complain about the place that they live
That all the people here are fake and they got nothin' to give
'Cause they been starin' at somebody else's version of shit
That makes another city seem more excitin' than it is
I know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome
Then she finally got to Rome
And all she did was post pictures for people at home
'Cause all that mattered was impressin' everybody she's known
I know another girl that's cryin' out for help
But her latest caption is ""Leave me alone""
I know a girl happily married 'til she puts down her phone
I know a girl that saves pictures from places she's flown
To post later and make it look like she still on the go
Look at the way we live
I wasn't hidin' my kid from the world
I was hidin' the world from my kid
From empty souls who just wake up and look to debate
Until you starin' at your seed, you can never relate
Breakin' news in my life, I don't run to the blogs
The only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call
They always ask, ""Why let the story run if it's false?""
You know a wise man once said nothin' at all
I'm exhausted and drained, I can't even pretend
All these people takin' miles when you give 'em an inch
All these followers but who gon' follow me to the end?
I guess I'll make it to the end and I'ma find out then

Yeah
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know?
For my niggas, though

[Verse]
Uh, you underestimated greatly
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me?
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya?
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it
Damn, this shit could go on a tape
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me?
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself
A couple somebodies started killin' themself
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation
Bad press during the summer over allegations
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?

But we just on some different shit
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit
And lately we've been fightin'
On some ""why-you-love-these-strippers?"" shit
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh!
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it)
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all
I only text her, man, I never call
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog
Yeah, that's why you gotta come through quick, quick
I'm posted at the Derek up on Westheimer
Hit me when you're done your shift, yeah

I can tell you not a rapper
Tryna sell this story, I don't even open up the package

I get boxes of free Jordan like I play for North Carolina
How much I make off the deal, how the fuck should I know?
All my watches always timeless, you can keep the diamonds
Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City
Man, I told my city I'd be gone 'til November then November came

People around you should really have nothing to say
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way
And the weekend's here, started it right
Even if you only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
Dying to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing, ooh

Houston girls love the way it goes down
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down
Vegas girls love the way it goes down

But I gotta say, oh, baby, oh, baby, why is this so familiar?
Just met her, already feel like I know the real her
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time
We must've been here before, it's still fresh on my mind
You got that shit that somebody would look for, but won't find
You must've done this before, this can't be your first time

[Verse 2: Drake]
They keep telling me don't save you
If I ignore all that advice, then something isn't right
Then who will I complain to?
But the weekend's here, started it right
Even if I only get part of it right
Live for today, plan for tomorrow
Party tonight, party tonight
You got your guards up, I do too
There's things we might discover
'Cause you got a past and I do too
We're perfect for each other

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
'Cause to her, I'm just a rapper and soon, she'll have met another
So if tonight's an accident, tomorrow, we'll recover
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book by its cover
I don't wan' be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder
About her
And she with it if I'm with it, and I'm with it
I know what makes her smile, but I wan' know what makes her different
Or should I just be realistic? Lipstick on the glass
See, I know this ain't your first, but it's better than your last, Tunechi

Shower her with dollar tips, shawty went and bought a whip
Guarantee the city remember your whole name, you throw that ho a scholarship
All of them ain't all equipped
And this saddens me, I see the pecking order
Quote-unquote bad bitches work the whole floor
Those that get laughed at sit off in a corner
Like a lab rat, nobody want her
Niggas that are married don't wanna go home
But we look up to them, they wish they were us
They want some new trim, we lust for some trust
Now the both of us are colorblind 'cause the other side looks greener
Which leaves your turf in a Boise state
Can't see a play or the team, 'cause
Everybody has an addiction, mine happens to be you
And those who say they don't, souls will later on say to them, ""That ain't true""
All of them will have an opinion
But y'all know what y'all can do with them
But if you unsure, I'll take you on tour
To a place you can stick that in
Well, sitting here sad as hell
Listening to Adele, I feel you, baby
""Someone Like You,"" more like someone unlike you
Or something that's familiar maybe
And I can tell that she wants a baby
And I can yell, girl, that you're crazy
Oh, what the hell? Nope, can't be lazy

Back when Ricky was doin' up Teesdale, I was doin' dinner with Teezy
I didn't trust no one, swore gyal lined me 'cause gyal too greazy
Niko never move neeky, sweatsuit Nike, sweatsuit DG
If man get beaky, ring ring, call up GiGi, do him up neatly
Used to look up to a man from certain ends with tune on repeat
Thought he was a bad boy, then 'til man got pinched and man went PC
Man went PC just like Dell and Windows, some man been those
Before I was ever around Kendall's, I was at ends though, dreamin' up Enzos
The woman I do end up with has to be a bad gyal just like Munchie
Can't have no pretentious ting when I know this road gets bumpy
Word to the broski Jay, he got different names in different countries
Three waps in the whip and we beat that case, where man live way too comfy
I don't do well with people makin' disses or makin' threats
Woi-oi, man got flown like private jets, for way, way less
I know you tried to get one down on us, ever since then it's been stress
'Cause you know the rest 'dem owe you one and we always pay them debts
Wassa, wassa, just like the crodie Pressa, I don't do no passa
Link with Skull and Cuz and Jamie ah yard and we deh pon Gaza

You niggas spend too much time on captions, not enough time on action
Pick one man with slaps that's rappin', I bet he don't want no clashings
The LV pouch on chest is just for fashion, niggas just actin'
Are you dumb or stupid? The wheels on the Rolls is Chromazz, headshot domazz
Just checked in at a hotel, floor that we on got potent aromas
OVOXO link up, mandem drink up, me and the drillers
Hawk and Sticks and Cash and Baka, Gucci, P, and Gilla
And the boy that sound like he sang on Thriller, you know that's been my nigga
Yeah, we just had to fix things, family, 6ix tings, we can't split up
As for the rest of the game, I'll do man dirty, man'll get two time
To me, that's just our side, I don't really care who rides on whose side
Bring ten shots to the poolside, never seen none of these grown men outside
4301, won't spare no one, niggas gotta know about Southside
Steppin' outta line, get outlined, and you know I'm tied up stateside
Bringin' man down when they take sides, tryna get saved by the bell like Bayside
Prince, I carry that last name, that shit stays on me like brand names
Jas just lined up brand new hand tings and nice guy on a madting

Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore

Always saw you for what you could've been
Ever since you met me
Like when Chrysler made that one car
That looked just like the Bentley
I always saw you for what you could've been
And even when it's business with you it's personal again
I knew you before you made ends meet
And now we're meeting our end

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine
[Verse 2]
You're so predictable I hate people like you
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you
How you supposed to figure out what I'm going through
You can't even figure out what's going on with you
You judge me 'fore you met me yeah it figures
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong
Out here in L.A., I don't know what's going on
I don't know what's going on

And it's all because you chose a side
You're supposed to put your pride aside and ride for me
Guess it wasn't time (yeah)
And of course you went and chose a side that wasn't mine

[Verse 3]
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice
But you always had something to say every other time
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way
I'm fooding and serving them all
Like I'm working for minimum wage
Someone up there must just love testing my patience
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment
Forgiveness for your ways
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya; that's how I was raised
Same way I'm right here still feeling the way
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day that
[Chorus]
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
How do you not check on me when things go wrong
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer
Much closer
All of my ""let's just be friends"" are friends I don't have anymore
Guess that's what they say you need your family for
Cause I can't depend on you anymore
Much closer

I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?
[Verse 2: Lil Durk & Drake]
I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

[Chorus: Drake]
Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

[Verse 3: Drake]
When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it
[Pre-Chorus: Drake]
I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Yeah, for the dogs dem, you know
Man when shit gets like this, man the whole city
Shit's crazy right now, and shit ain't gonna stop
Know shit gonna get a lot more worse before it get any better

[Verse 1]
Look, momma hit my phone and said rap's no good
Better than her telling me the check's no good
Now they wanna act like I do no good
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it
Same way, breads gotta break for it
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now
I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
[Verse 2]
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand
I'ma start telling niggas ""Get it how you can""
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away
Six upside down, it's a nine now
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it

[Chorus]
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
[Outro]
… And then when I saw the news
Make me feel afraid of how I’d been to you
Trust me when I say I thought it all through
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves
God made himself a way from me to you
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side

Got too much pride for my own good right now
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

[Verse 3]
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house
She made tea for me
We talked about love and what life could really be for me
She said, ""When that shit is real, you just know""
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house
He had weed for me
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me
Said the city stress him out on the low
I said, ""I feel you, nigga, I already know""
Yeah, already...
Girls talkin' 'bout, ""You gotta leave already?""
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already
Gave you little help, you need more already
Damn, you need more already?
'Fore you said ""You're mine"" I was yours already
22, had the Bentley four-door already
Even as a boy, I was the boy already
So you know that that mean pussy galore already
Mention other girls, you get insecure already
That was in the past, I matured already
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already
You go to Chanel and get rewards already
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already
Know I do this shit for H-Town already
Already, already, yeah
Back up in this thing, it's a go
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before
Had to get it back, had to get it back
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy
You would prolly kill another man for the boy
You would prolly...
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy

She says, ""Kiss me like you miss me
Fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fuckin' someone else
Just fuck her like she ain't me""
Damn, those words are scary
Those words are scary, Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me
I was in love two years ago and gave the baggage to my ex
It's all for her to carry, bags she deserve to carry
I hate that ho, I make it so hard just to talk, don't I?
I get off-topic, don't I? I get it poppin', don't I?
I'll end up stoppin', won't I?
And by the time I end up stoppin'
You'll be rockin' one of the rings that you pointed out while shoppin' with a nigga, don't lie
Uh, she's losin' it right now
'Cause if I wasn't who I am, she would've been movin' in by now
But instead we're movin' slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin' it right now
But this money comin' in is just confusin' shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin' it right now, oh

[Chorus]
I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down
'Cause I hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
Half the time, we don't end up fucking, I don't ask her for nothing
You leave me in the morning, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin' alone, I hate sleepin' alone
So she's here and we're both so gone
[Verse 2]
Hotel to hotel, girl, I could use your company
Full name and birthday, I book a flight and you come to me
But she don't want a weekend, she wants all of me or none of me
If she can't work with all of me, then she says she done with me
You say that you're over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with your shit, I put you back in your place
She tells me, ""I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face""
And hangs up, yeah, how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggas you fucking with too?
And whoever I be with, they got nothing on you
That's just something to do when there's nothing to do
Yeah, but she's losing it right now
She has choices she should make, I think she's choosing it right now
One more chance to make it right, I think I'm using it right now
You just said I never learn, I guess I'm proving it right now, oh

I say I'd rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they'd be down

Leave me out the comments, leave me out the nonsense
Speakin' out of context, people need some content
Niggas tryna keep up, shit is not a contest
Whippin' Benz concept
Heaven-sent, God-sent
Least that's what my mom says
Proof is in the progress, money's not a object
Busy than a motherfucker, you know how my job get
Barkin' up the wrong tree, you know how the dogs get
Haven't fallen off yet, yee
Come with a classic, they come around years later and say it's a sleeper
The earrings are real, the petty is real, might charge my ex for a feature
Deposit the money to Brenda, LaTisha, or Linda, Felicia
She came for me twice, I didn't even nut for her once, you know I'm a pleaser
Forty-two millimeter, was made in Geneva
Yeah, I probably should go to Yeshiva, we went to Ibiza
Yeah, I probably should go link with Yeezy, I need me some Jesus
But soon as I started confessin' my sins, he wouldn't believe us

And some M's, got a lot of M's on my mind

I can't respond, we just go at your people
If I left some racks on the bed, you can keep it
This shit gettin' deeper and deeper, I dig it
My shovel wasn't bent, I was broke, had to fix it
A shark in the water, you swim with the lil' fishes
I hit today, by tomorrow, she miss it
I grab her neck, she look up, then I kiss it
I'm not a GOAT, but I fit the description
I like to pour, so I get the prescription
We walk around with them bands in our britches
This gun ain't gon' jam, when I blow, I ain't missin'
I'm droppin' hit after hit, I'm just chillin'
But I'll send a hit while I chill with my children
Bigger the business, the bigger the office
I fucked 'round and found me a swag, then I caught up
They call for my artists, they makin' me offers
I don't even bargain, I'll start from the bottom
I lost a Ferrari, Las Vegas, Nevada
I woke up the followin' day and went harder
I'm crackin' my shell now, they see that I'm smarter
I gotta get money, I love to get charter
I gave her four Birkins and one's for her daughter
I can't let 'em down, walk around with my guard up
I'm screamin' out ""YOLO,"" yeah, that's still the motto

Yeah, you feel the pressure, man, I know the pressure
And my wifey is a spice like I'm David Beckham
A lot of pent up aggression comin' out of my section
OVO on me while y'all niggas was playin' dress-up
And I know who gon' take the fall with me
They right here on call with me, they all with me
You could throw curve balls but I got the glove fitted
They've been sayin' it's love, but it isn't love, is it?
Toast to the days when they wasn't out to get me
I worked at Jaydees Connections whenever Jason let me
Ceesay’s, I was buyin' fitteds everyday
Kiddie's Caribana, tryin' not to catch a stray
I dropped out right before I graduate
Six credits left, my mama had her saddest day
“It's only up from here, I promise, you just gotta wait”
And she took my word for it, that's all I had to say
Lately I just feel so out of character
The paranoia can start to turn into arrogance
Thoughts too deep to go work 'em out with a therapist
I get a blank page when I try to draw a comparison
I'm gettin' straight to the point with it
Need y'all to know that I never needed none of y'all niggas
Fuck bein' all buddy buddy with the opposition
It's like the front of the plane, nigga, it's all business
But I haven't flown with y'all boys in a minute
[Verse 2]
Look, they'd rather run up on me than towards their goals
My niggas still hit the club when it's 20 below
Who you think runnin' this show?
You saw it in me at 20 years old
The lingo start to sound like we talkin' in code
I got a pure soul, I don't do the hate
You don't worry 'bout fittin' in when you custom made
Me and Niko used to plot on how to make a change
Now me and Kobe doin' shots the night before the game
Still drop 40 with liquor in my system
Numbers goin' unlisted just to create some distance
I might see you on and off but I'll never switch ya
Niggas quick to double cross like both of us Christian
Lamborghini got me feelin' like I'm Christian Bale
And I never bend my morals for the ticket sales
Tippin' scales, bars heavy like triple XL
I never tag no one in, I'd rather get you myself
Runnin' through the 6, thumbin' through the contracts
I'm possessed, you can see it under the contacts
They think I had the silver spoon but they'll get it soon
I still got somethin' left to prove since you left me room
Payment plan for the family debt, we in the minus
And like it's goin' in a trunk, I put it all behind us
Where you tryna go? I got it, I'll take us wherever
I'm a staple in the game, all my papers together
And my life is on display like Truman
They wanna pree the movements, gotta start to make 'em sooner
My exes made some of my favorite music
I dated women from my favorite movies
Karma's such a thing of beauty
I'd share more of my story but you wouldn't believe it
It's farfetched like I threw that shit a hundred meters
I keep it a hundred like I'm running a fever
I might take a breather but I won't ever leave you
If I was you, I wouldn't like me either

Yeah, I get it
I get it, yeah

[Verse 1]
Why would I say all these things to have you feelin' a way?
Why would I tell you I'm 30 away if I'm not on the way?
Why do I settle for women that force me to pick up the pieces?
Why do I want an independent woman
To feel like she needs me?—I lost my way

[Chorus]
I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you
Oh, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Run your mouth, I'd rather listen to someone else
I gave your nickname to someone else
I know you're seein' someone that loves you
And I don't want you to see no one else
I don't want you here with no one else
I don't wanna do this with no one else
I used to know you back when you was young
Your brother brought me through, you saw me
That made me think of you so differently
I miss the feeling of you missing me
But you say you're over and done with me
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus]
Now redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you (think about me)
Aw, please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words
To say to you right now, yeah

[Verse 3]
Say to you—but eighty percent of it wasn't true, yeah
Say to you—a Mercedes coupe that you're still drivin'
Was for me and you, girl
Really gon' spend the winter with this other nigga?
Act like he's really the one to get through it with you
Clicked up with Jessica, Kim
You know that I'm bound to see you
And they both say that you're over and done with me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
They say redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Yeah, aww yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you think about me
Aw yeah, yeah, yeah
Redemption's on your mind when you
Aw please give me time
Cause I'm searchin' for these words to say to you right now
[Verse 4]
Damn, I'm not unrealistic with none of my women
I tell them if they ain't with it then let's just forget it
Relationships slowin' me down, they slow down the vision
Guess I'm not in a position to deal with commitment
Certain people need to tell me they're proud of me
That mean a lot to me
Not havin' closure, it take a lot out of me
This year for Christmas I just want apologies
Sydney gave up on me when I went missin'
Syn had a baby and treated me different
Erika sued me and opened a business
Wonder if they wish it could've been different
Wonder what they'd do put in my position
I wonder, when my shit drop, do they listen?
Wonder if they're second guessin' their decisions
I hate the number 2, that shit is unforgiving
Tryna satisfy everybody, it's like they can't get enough
Until enough is enough, and then it's too much
You tip the scale when I weigh my options
West Palm girls are spoiled rotten
Tiffany on you, you know you poppin'
I'll kill somebody if they give you problems
Master bedroom's where we get it poppin'
Just ignore all the skeletons in my closet
I'm a walkin' come-up, I'm a bank deposit
Sell my secrets and get top dollar
Sell my secrets for a Range Rover
Opportunity and temptation
They would sell my secrets for a tropical vacation
Sell my secrets back to me if I was payin'
Who's gonna save me when I need savin'?
Since Take Care, I've been caretakin'
But second chances, that ain't how you livin'
Redemption on your mind, I'll never be forgiven

Wrote this shit, January 21
Baby girl, I had to run, I'll be back a couple months
Kendall turned 21, was up the street with 21
They could see me online, but they won't see me on the ones
I got Dubai plates in the California state
I got her waitin' at my place, I got no baby on the way
I'm talkin' Baby like Stunna, I'm talkin' Baby like Face
Lost millions in the past, I'm talkin' maybe like eight
Couple niggas from the city
Wishin' on a star, could they be like Drake
Sorry, no, not today, you gotta find your own way
Big dog from the 6, I'm talkin' Dogg like Nate
My shit be raw out the gate, I don't need another take
40 got house on the lake, I ain't know we had a lake
She complainin' how I'm late, I ain't know it was a date
Niggas see me in person
First thing they say is, ""I know you need a break.""
Hell naw, I feel great, ready now, why wait?
Like a kiss from a rose I could be the one to seal your whole fate
So be careful what you think, think about what you gon' say
Gotta deal with people straight, I got my 23's laced
It's a marathon, not a sprint, but I still gotta win the race, yeah

[Chorus: Drake]
And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to Him
Yeah, I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
Yeah, I did some wrong, I had no choice in my defense
Someone watchin' over us, so shout goes out to—
[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
2 Chainz, I'm a real one
Few shows, that's a mil run
When she bust it down
I said, ""Thanks for givin' to me,"" like a pilgrim
Cold world'll be chillin'
Earmuffs on the children
Used to trap out the Hilton
Got wood on the Cartiers: that's a face full of splinters
Count a bankroll for dinner
This the wrong place to enter
Phone sex for breakfast, all kinda women text us
Met her at the Super Bowl
Told her I stayed down the street from Texas
A-Town, I stay down, yeah it's all in the wrist
This one here out the fence
Trap jumpin' like “tha Carter”, mean it jumpin' like Vince
Moved on from the election
Introduced her to the plug
Can't believe they tried to take the connection
Ooh, girl, you a blessin', fine ass, be finessin'
Yeah I love my fans but I don't wanna take pictures in the restroom
Drench God with the 6 God
Point guard and the two guard
""Pretty Girls Like Trap Music"" so I woke up with my wood hard

And I'm convinced
I made sacrifices, I been ballin' ever since
We seein' so many blessings, shit don't make no sense

Yeah
Yeah

[Verse]
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered
Somehow I always rise above it
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question
Last night I went to sleep wanting more
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards
Some nights I wish I could go back in life
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage
You need to act your age and not your girl's age
It gets worse by the annual
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention
I remember when it used to be music that did it
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'?
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on
But here we are, yeah
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments
Bitches alter my messages like we had words
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block
Nobody lookin' out for nobody
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it
And then they start to ""R.I.P."" about it
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it
Oh, you gotta love it—
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca
Julia, Ericka, Southern America
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all
""Best I Ever Had"" seems like a decade ago
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace?
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh)
Yeah
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop)
I know your girl well, just not in public
Blame the city, I'm a product of it
Young nigga from the city
You gotta love it

Yeah, gotta love it

Feelin' young but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm outside, twenty-nine, G5, seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever hurt one and I'm still here
Outside, frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
[Verse 2: Drake]
Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busy body
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

[Chorus: Drake, Travis Scott, Both]
I'm outside (Yeah), twenty-nine (Yeah), G5, seaside

Spread your legs downtown, as I'm goin' out to eat

I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me

Worry, sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)

At the crib all by myself, this shit be cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Break it)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Oooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my lead
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh), I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (Oh, oh)

I'm outside (Ah-ah, ah-ah), twenty-nine, G5 (Ah-ah, ah-ah), seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace (Ah-ah, ah)

[Verse 1]
Bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape
Probably shouldn't be driving, it just got so much harder
Can't even see it straight, I can't even see it straight, ah
Fuck with me, I buy the shots
Live a little, 'cause niggas die a lot
And lie a lot, but I'm the truth, that's right, I fuckin' said it
The living proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven
You, girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit
I could tell a lie if you askin' me my whereabouts
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about
Rap and bitches, rap and bitches, bitches and rappin'
Rappin' and bitches until all of it switches, I swear
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was
I'm the greatest, man, I said that before I knew I was
That's what's important, what really happened before this
When me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans
Singing, ""Walking like a man, finger on the trigger
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga,"" ah
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves
I was pushing myself to get something that I deserve
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways
[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga
Do it for the city (UGK, fuck these other niggas)
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance
Tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good
Do me like the women from my town would
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors
Talking all them good things, that's all I'm really good for
Memphis, Tennessee know, see, I start to go deep back
In Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack
And these niggas got them diamonds glowin' in they mouth
And they rockin' furs like it's snowin' in the South
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryna be like?
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade
Soon as I realize that turnin' papers in won't get me paid
And if I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall, yeah, I need that
Making major changes to the life I'm livin'
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision
That was back in the days, Acura days
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin' back to my ways
[Chorus]
People always ask how I got my nice things
Take my crown to the grave, I'm an underground king
I bet we can make tonight the greatest story ever told
'Cause I'm down to spend whatever, lately, I've been on a roll
And I do it for the city 'cause you know the city love a nigga

One of dem ones—right

[Verse]
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit for my nigga Renny
Back when we couldn't buy pizza cause we were down to pennies
Feel like we go back a century, run in the store for Centuries
Then bring it back to your brother, man, we had to respect it
He was wavy, doin' mixtapes out of your basement
He let us hit the weed on occasion for entertainment
Then he would leave us at the house and go out on a mission
We probably would've got in less trouble just goin' with him
Feel like I never say much but, man, there's a lot to know
Feel like the difference between us really startin' to show
I'm lookin at they first week numbers like, ""What are those?""
I mean, you boys not even coming close
I gave niggas like you a reason for celebration
You number one and I'm Eddie Murphy, we tradin' places
Look in the mirror, I'm closer than I really appear
Creepin' like Chilli without the tender, love, and care
No tender love and care, no love and affection
I got a price on my head but there's a risk in collecting
I might be here as a vessel to teach people a lesson
Feel like they wanted me dead but couldn't pull it together
Yeah, but here we are and it's a new semester
40 the only one that know how I deal with the pressure
A couple nights where it started to feel like the feelings fadin'
A lot of problems that can't be fixed with a conversation
Your best day is my worst day, I get green like Earth Day
You treat me like I'm born yesterday, you forgot my birthday
You don't be scorin' perfect
You don't be workin' like how we be workin'
You platinum like wrappers
On Hershey's boy, that shit is worthless
You get the message over and over like it was urgent
And then act like you ain't heard it when you see me in person
The only thing I did to end up here was put the work in
And did it with a purpose
Used to have secret handshakes to confirm my friendships
Nowadays, they just shakin' my hand to hide the tension
A lot of people just hit me up when my name is mentioned
Shout out to KD, we relate, we get the same attention
It's rainin' money, Oklahoma City Thunder
The most successful rapper 35 and under
I'm assumin' everybody's 35 and under
That's when I plan to retire, man, it's already funded
Yeah, I brought your wifey out to Saint Martin
She violated, I sent her back where it all started
How quick they are to forget about their bachelor apartment
Leave it to niggas like you to show em' light in the darkness
Told my momma that I found a lady in the east
Cancun, when I got signed, they upgraded the suite
Don Julio in the freezer that they gave us for free
I get you all you can eat, just have some patience with me
You wouldn't tell me you loved me, started seein' Monique
Last time I heard from Monique, T-Minus was makin' beats
I used to hit the corner store to get to Tahiti Treat
Now the talk at the corner store is I'm TBE
The best ever, don't ever question, you know better
But shit ain’t always how it seems when it’s sewn together
Yeah, I let that last line breathe, it take a second to get it
Weston Road flows, my confidence level gettin' settled
Don't get hyped for the moment then start to backpedal
Don't let your newfound fame fool you
Or cloud up your judgement to talk loosely, I really do this
Been flowin' stupid since Vince Carter
Was on some through the legs arm in the hoop shit
Drinkin' Hpnotiq with Glenn Lewis, I been through it
Y'all was so afraid to lay claim to it
Too busy face screwin' on waste movements
You was ridin' TTC metro, I had the place boomin'
First take Drake, you know I rarely have to take two it
And they still take to it
Big Apple had the white hummer parked right in front of Fluid
And we be walkin' in that bitch like we already knew it
But money can't buy happiness, Jellee talkin' truthful
But I'm happiest when I can buy what I want
Get high when I want

Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 PM like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
Cover my ears, my security government tier
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits
Check the guest list
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira

[Verse 3: Drake]
How you mean? How you mean? What you know about the team?
You just know what you get told, girl, I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gon' have to get it cleaned
She been going way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby, she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know, I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires
Girl, they love me like I'm Prince, like the new king with the crown
Bunch of Underground Kingz, thought you knew how we get down, huh?
[Refrain: Jon B]
Ooh, finally got you right here (Said I finally got my baby)
Tonight, I'll ease your mind (Tonight, I'll ease your mind)
That's why I'm callin' on you (Why I'm callin' on you)

Let's call up and, uh

[Interlude]
All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'ma sip until I feel it, I'ma smoke it 'til it's done
I don't really give a fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody should've told you
I'm on one (Ayy), fuck it, I'm on one (Yeah)
I said I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one, a strong one
Two white cups and I got that drink
It could be purple, it could be pink
Depending on how you mix that shit
Money to be got, and I'ma get that shit
'Cause I'm on one, fuck it, I'm on one
Aw yeah, aw yeah
You know what I'm
Oh yes, oh yeah
Oh yes, oh yeah
Uh, oh yes, oh yeah
Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
You know what I'm sipping, I'll teach you how to mix it
But you're the only one 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
They might, they might catch me slipping and put in something different
So you're the only one, 'cause I don't trust these bitches
I don't, I don't trust these bitches, they might catch me slipping

[Verse 2]
Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfuckin' North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting courtside
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the fuck we 'posed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell
Certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more, uh
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell 'em all
Leave them cell phones on the table where we see them
I'm all day with it, man, AM to the PM
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, oh
[Bridge]
That's that shit that drives me crazy
And it's all that I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find 'em in you, in you

Man, I'm really him, you just fillin' in
Man, I got a blunt, can I get a light? Yeah

Had a nigga convinced, got me too excited
Yeah, you played me, you played me, you played me

I do for a living but is way less wavy
How you even managin' to keep straight faces
In all the pictures that I seen lately
Lord knows you still look amazin'
That's besides the point I'm makin'
You're way too opinionated to have to force it, to have to fake it
You had potential, I coulda shaped it
You went and caved in (Ooh yeah)
We coulda waited, I wasn't rushin', difference in ages
You're old enough, but you're still a baby
You've shared stories where you did amazin'

Shifted your focus, lens lookin' jaded (Jaded)

Sometimes I laugh with God about how you can't stop me
I'm his darkest angel probably but he still got me
I'm gettin' mine, but still I better lives
And shit I set aside to make sure that my people getting by
Brunch with some Qatar royals and my cup is all oil
You know it's real when your niggas'll take the fall for you
All loyal so you keep eggin' me on
And we gonna have to crack a shell just to prove to you, you ain't hard-boiled, mm
Last night I tried some raw oysters
Man that boy growin' up quick, that boy know he the shit
That boy singin' on every song when he know he can spit
That boy manifested it, that boy knew it was written
That boy did it on purpose
That boy know that they shittin' on you, and they can't get past you
You should've followed all my moves, you won't realize 'til after
And if I left this shit to chance I would've picked a name like Chance the Rapper
Yeah, no offense 'cause I don't know that nigga
I'm focused on making records and gettin' bigger
Just hits, no misses, that's for the married folk
Tell 'em fix my suite up 'cause I'm comin' home
I heard they talking crazy, I was out of town
You know they love to pop all that shit when I'm not around
But when I'm here, not a sound, that'll make me snap, jot it down
Go in the booth and lay a body down
Know some Somalis that say we got it Wallahi
Get us donuts and coffee, we'll wait for him in the lobby
And I gotta tell him chill, Sprite got me on payroll
Let that man live, they say, ""Okay, if you say so""
See whatever I say goes, I play like I'm on 'roids, no Canseco
No Oakland A's though, shout out the Bay though
I think I'm on my eighth flow, just watch me paint flow
We all do it for the art so I could never hate though
Signin' off on more deals than a lawyer with a heavy case load
How the game turn into the Drake show?
Dog, what the fuck happen to so-and-so, where did they go?
Too worried 'bout bitches and fashion, they go missin' in action
And then you never notice they missin'
On some Hunger Games shit, I would die for my district
Jennifer Lawrence, you can really get it, yeah
I mean, for real, girl you know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to do it for ya
You know I had to— oh, wait, sidebar, left some beat at the end
So that all of you fuck niggas could loop it and get your lies off
