Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, igh
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, igh

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it low-key like Thor lil' bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling ""Fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling ""Fuck me""
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam
[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)
(Kisses, kisses)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass
[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted (Yah)
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!
[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mamas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money (Money)
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea (True)
Big yacht, no power steering (Yeah)

My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz

There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby

Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker

Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal

Chano, Chatham's own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer
Held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroBois
City on the come up, shout that nigga Sosa!
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin': buenas noches!
Wonder if I wrote this, 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stockbroker, winter solstice
I could win an Oscar, Russian accent husky
Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

God give me one sentence more
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?
Hashtag it, get mentions for it
Make you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels, yop!
That one, drown in the juice nigga
Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude, you the new nigga!
How's it feel to be you? Yo no sé
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pop's smashed
I'm a genius, a mothafuckin' pop smash
Hit sensei, master
Jack and Lindsey, Wiley, Kembe
Been paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA

Tripped, racing yaself tryna' chase the paper
I just faced a Veg-er
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill, everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest of fruits
And the thirst is the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows
And chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to the land where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a handful of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'ma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

And your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex

Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch

Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'ma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip

You should ask us if we scared too

It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

[Outro: Chance The Rapper & Eryn Allen Kane]
Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Tastes like Juicy Fruit

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

When the praises go up, the blessings come down

It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Chorus: Jamila Woods & Chance The Rapper]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone (Don't be mad)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh
(Good God)

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like ""That's not your jersey?""
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal, man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Ah, ah, ah, ah for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Couldn't stop me, but it slowed me, though
Yeah, a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me, though
Damn, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the do-si-do
'Til they fuck around, sign me to OVO
Ooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split a atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Chorus: Saba]
They was talkin', ""Woo, this woo wap da bam""
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded

All of a sudden, woo wap da bam, you can't touch me

I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace, they bunny hopping Heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmamas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, mama say I'm culture
GCI, 107.5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke

I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother footwork, your play sister juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shorties with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came here for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause

We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down,"" Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean, it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist to your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as mama's hands
Running water standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold like Nat King
I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous, unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label, pro-famous
I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me, but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shorty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn

I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be

You must've missed the come-up, I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa, I had to master stampedes

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good, igh

But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap, collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, ""The Rapper""
Magical word (Poof), please say ""Kadabra""
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn

Socks on concrete, Jolly Rancher kids
I was talkin' back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank-top, nappy headed bike-stealin' Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th Street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We were still catchin' lightnin' bugs when the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark 'cause the big shorties act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, niggas shootin'
Summer school get to losin' students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer, our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summertime don't got no time no more

Fucked up and fucked all my friends

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why God phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter, wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot of off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
You know what I mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck, bang bang, yelling ""Fuck Fox News""
Booyaka buckle up, motherfuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool

I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off-white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon-toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles

[Verse 3: Saba]
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously, they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us, we tryna get lucky, doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating, shit come hot, but y'all still love me
Ugh, how Father Time a deadbeat? Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, igh

Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God, seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

Me new (People sing)
This water is deep (Yes, yes and I need You to)
Jesus, rescue me (Come on, save me, I need You to)
Take me to Your mountain (Hallelujah)
So someday Chicago will be free (Someday, we'll all be free)
Be free (Say)

[Interlude]
The first is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on his side
I cannot modify or ratify, my mama made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach, Barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig 'til he petrify
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide,
79th, 79th
I don't believe in science, I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom
Hosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin seed-sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lies
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like ""shhh""
[Verse 2: Jay Electronica]
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day, but I spent my night-time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear-back or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a lifeline
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali'll swallow a valley for every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations with a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley from the project to the house of Parliament?
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures and gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery Babylon tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground48Embed"

We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Lil' bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry the child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her

Let me crack this blunt
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
She said, ""Let me lick this blunt""
Slow it down for a second

We deserve a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Truth being told
We used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoke to Fetty, sing ""ZooWap""
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I should've knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need a actual smoke sesh

Slow it down for a second
Take it down, ooh

I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding you back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down, ooh
I got to lay back the roof
I got her breakin' the rules
She can't be taking no calls
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me her mom was a ho
I gave her Percs for herself
I give her Perc for esteem
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take that molly, it's clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and 'gars
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can

Let me rub you all over

'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well, maybe that shit was my interest

Oh, bitch, I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper

Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer

And some fruit snacks, and some killers
Phone numbers on speed dial, call them, save monkey guerillas
Everything's good

I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses, even persons leave 'em hurtin', bleedin'
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches

See my name when you Google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's good
But I knew I was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin'
With bad bitches, put 'em aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays
Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn, it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up
'Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
And I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo

Here's a tab of acid for your ear
You're the plastic, I'm the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan's Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I'm the Don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I'm a kamikaze and I'm a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the nine in all blue, yelling, ""I'm a neutral""
But I'ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I'ma fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hands, son, breaking walls like Samson
But I'ma throw a tantrum 'til I'm on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighters up 'til life is up and light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it's nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.44's for 15, yeah my nigga, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio

Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain't no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don't answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys

[Verse]
What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
Igh
[Chorus]
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes
It ain't nothin' you could say but ""That's love""
That's love
That's love

Say that's love, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
Charlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class switcher, time bender
Chance Bennett, a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair, fun fact
I'm never going back to school, been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila, you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without 'em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night
[Chorus]
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 2]
Uh, yo, this prom shit feel like the Grammys, yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask, ""Where'd Granny go?""
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candids to the family, get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jann who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again
[Chorus]
'Cause it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 3]
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down, I don't write e'rything
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like, ""Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up""
'Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up, flying lotus
""You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara""
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night
[Chorus]
It's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, hope the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps 'cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
'Til my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try an' go bowling
'Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding, getting nice 'cause it's nice out

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day 'til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam, all my friends, when my mans go away
Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day 'til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam, all my friends, when my mans go away
[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Don't wake up, don't wake up, don't wake up too fast
Don't make up your mind, you should flake on that class
Sing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass
Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferraro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' 'em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of Operation with Parkinson's
Young kid rappers, kidnapper
Young whippersnappers that will whip past ya
Will get at you, come get at you
Wanna break ya off, come Kit-Kat you

[Verse 3: Sulaiman]
Now the teamwork make the dream work
Go ahead and send an application if you need work
If it need hurt, then I'ma bring hurt
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt
Now you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin' down
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin' to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting 'cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get 'em cheese so I can get 'em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack
But I got her on my lap, all she do is make it clap

[Intro]
He should try enjoying life, rather than spending his time trying to outsmart me. While he's alive, that is
I know what you're saying but it's not that simple, it's just human nature
What's that guy doing, I wonder?
[Verse 1]
I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbors came to spectate
Niggas that's tough now used to get little in the dark
It's all cool now, we're all little kids at heart
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda's House?
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cell phones
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin's birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I'll bust your ass at pool, on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin' a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybe I'ma find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing 'bout freedom

[Chorus]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smile comes through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
[Verse 2]
Let's take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy winter coats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you'll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
MY$FITS and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps, uhh

[Chorus]
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smile comes through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God

[Verse 3]
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World?
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like ""Lord, let me see another year like this"", uhh
[Chorus]

Santa to children, had to bag up the goods
They say I'm savin' my city, say I'm stayin' for good
They screamin', ""Chano for mayor,"" I'm thinkin' maybe I should
Fucked a few A&R's, told 'em, ""Bitch I can’t wife you""
Told your ass since day one, I don't like labels or titles
I'm a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts
That need fixes for habits, in love with carrots and cabbage
I'm a savage, established, bad bitch magnet, I'm magic
Your majesty, I'm majestic, I think my message is massive
Think you passive aggressive
I think you passed up your prime
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance
Now pass it to Arab
I should have rhymed it with rhyme
Ain't we been here before?
Ain't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show?
Then I rapped at that show, simple as that
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps
And it goes like...

Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider

Blow out your speakers, roll some more loud
That's the sound of the reefer, I think my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the bleachers
Think my teachers need features
I think I'm walkin' with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown
I been close to the edge, I been trippin' and stuff
Somebody slipped me a mickey but I ain't giving a fuck
Really, a milli'? How 'bout six billion more
Or I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord?
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans
I asked the acid if words were worth worryin' over
Her explanation seemed agitated
She said let me answer your question
With some questions questionin' yours
Like why the devil can't get you?
And why these labels can't catch you?
And why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?
Think about it
I woke up this mornin', I woke up this mornin'
Gotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this mornin'

For chiefin' a hunnid blunts, 14,400 minutes
Fans all in the stands, they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net, ooh, give me my tennis
Shoes, give me a minute, ooh, I can't be tardy
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10 Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him, back seat, squad car, nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
Finna see the 10 Day Pestilence, so far, so good, so special and
No stars, good jobs, or excellents
And I'm still so fucking nonchalant
Ooh, you got suspended, ooh, you not gon' finish
Ooh, you look familiar, ooh, you look like Kenneth
Damn they gon' resent it, ooh, you representin'

All my raps was 'bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and darken your doorstep

Where's the return on investment? My first A&R
That shit was played unless you would hit play in the car
We hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot, don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
And skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold SCAR
There it get late 'fore it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she could play in the stars
High rise, eye to eye with fireworks
So high your ears fire, they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse, I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time, that's just not how it works
Three jobs, you afforded the crib
Fuck child support, you supported the kid
A full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
So you first up, go in order of dibs
My big homie told me, ""Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down, don't settle for settlement""
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew, you can't marry her?
Got shit sonny, now you can't share?
New Dad step in, you can’t stare?
You knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th and Ingleside
Feel like you remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure that they make the ring so tight

Always ten toes like feet (Ss), came with some built-in cleat (Ss)
You don't need help like cheats, you don't need help like Meeseeks

Today I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out
I hope it work out

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Luckily, my ex ugly
I don't eat, so she can't get no lunch with me
I don't reach, so she can't get in touch with me
Can't be buds with me
Don't know what to be
She gon' cuss at me
Told her ""give it a rest,"" so I keep custody
Keep it all side-eyes and side-hugs with me
I know that my girl's trust is a luxury
I don't want my next album sounding all Usher-y
But I must confess, I must confess
For every single ex, I want the best
I really wish you nothing but success
I know it's gonna work out
[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Doesn't it get dark, right before the sun peeks
And bares his face? And doesn't it get so hard to breathe?
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
With nothing left to give, with nothing left to say
When no one says they're wrong, or sets the record straight

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper & Francis and the Lights]
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
That shit might hurt now, but I'm with her now
Don't need closure now, just keep the shirt now
Sorry you were led to believe
Bunch of different stories that was never to be
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be
Funny we both know that you look better than me
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me
I'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be
And I'm getting better gotta hand it to me
Seem to always work out when you hand it to Jesus

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out

I believe in long distance love, God that's above
Bond that's so strong can't let y'all bald-headed—
Yeah, y'all interrupt, you all in a rush
We all gon' meet up in the up, in the upper room
If I run into em', I'll be ru-running to em'
We could re-run the show, we could re-bump into 'em
If we read the wrong one, we could re-jump the broom
If we read the wrong one, baby we jump the groom
I'm ready to be groomed
I'm ready to assume, the position is filled
I was ret since the womb
I was not made for this, this was made for me
And it's gonna work out

Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the ""27 Club""
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love

[Chorus: Ben Gibbard]
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever

Fuck with me y'all
I mean either way you stuck with me y'all
I'm coming at these rap niggas first
And for most that's unluckily y'all
Better know it
Just a mustard seed dog that I ever really needed
Nigga's just tryna see Jesus
Sipping water like it come with different cheeses
All of your opinions facetious, it's feces
I got a thesis or slick dissertation
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive
All at the same damn time, why? Chi to kill them with kindness
Hit them with the Visine, try to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers the best part of waking up
Is the alignment of self with God, and that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't ever really hug the scene
Y'all know I been submarine with this shit
Little more Actavis how I lean with this shit
Black as hell, still the cream of this crop
With dream, no king just Ving Rhames with six shots
It's the dawn of the dead and I feel so alive
And the free been in here you can tell by my mind, like
[Hook: Arima Ederra]

Lazy male complaining about how in high school he could, but his ACL
Ay be clear, this my daddy house, you just the uncle from ATL
(Better take out that trash)
Boy get your big....grown ass on
Old ass home, broke ass drinking up all the milk
But can't do no laundry, e-Harmony romance on
Watch your tone folk, talking to grown folk
Yeah, yeah, get that bass out your voice, you were sounding like Tone Lōc
Now watch how I move, different chapters
Decisions, missions, visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud, ""My favorite rapper a Christian rapper""
And he got fate in his faith in his soul
And a tape, and a cape and that drape from out west
To the lake and it cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait but it never come late
From tobacco back roads to bus seat back rows
A Black boy, black rose, back rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountains peak and plateaus plateau, ya kna wha' mean?

[Verse 3: Alex Wiley]
Kinda crazy how it fall up in your lap right?
Shit was determined in a past life
If you ask nicely, mad, nice
Even with mad lights you couldn't see the boy
Up in class like I'm only half right, they ain't believe the boy
Wave when you pass them, moments you should bask in
Wonder if the Lord's on my side, let me ask him, or ask her
I don't need a password, don't ask about my past word
Living until my last words, wondering if this music got the slash in
Don't forget the cash and mix in with the passion, oh
If I don't feel the love then I'mma pass end
Shit is everlasting, I'mma have a blast and uh
I'mma have a good day, I'mma stay zonin'
I might get high as shit or I might stay sober
Might roll a J and I might just pass it
Might hit the Bay and I might trip acid
They tried to treat us like some bummy little street kids
I tell 'em ""When you dream, make sure that you dream big""
You could be cool and an Uber driver
The next minute you in Aruba, you scuba divin'
I hope they sell you the truth and that you survivin'
Don't do how they gon' scrutinize 'em
And looking at the youth, tryna euthanize 'em
If it was up to you they would nuke the projects

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Sparring is training, chain-snatching the slaves
But a rap song is a match in a cave
Dim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way
Drunk off of light, lies, laughing
Claiming asylum while shying in shade
I can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray
And my roses is black
Fuck the pharaohs and the Pharisees, Moses is back
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black
I don't know one Temptation that had Otis's back
Sparring is training; this a jumping jack
I'm the scariest Jack in the pumpkin patch
Float like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee
I swing like a lumberjack, go back when I'm up at bat
They tried to label me a non-rapper
I'm an independent contractor, card cracker
Sparring is training without the training wheels
You made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal
You played it straight, hated, graduated
Waited-waited, you still a waiter still
Mice will always find out ways to steal
Picture me, fifth of Hennessy and a Swisher Sweet
Fake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me
""Wake up, wake up,"" like ""Remember me?""
Said one plus one make three, and you finna see
You ain't as grown as you finna be
You got them young nigga tendencies
[Verse 2: Noname]
Mm... Sentimental energy
I let the light in beside him, I stand like angel
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo
Apologetic, nonreligious, consequential fable
Like good is good, the love in me is goodly, or godly
The Bible say mistakes is necessary
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house
My soloist is sold out to attentive God
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers
On airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest
Sparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee
Afro-Americano Sunny D, but bet I sting, no die

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper & Both]
Sparring is training, Jacob wrestled with God
In the desert 'til he broke him and he blessed him
And he rescued his heart
I struggle with love, I juggle my loves
I cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs
Sparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs
Jigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps

[Transition: Noname (Chance The Rapper)]
You giving back? (I'm giving back)
Tit for tat
[Verse 4: Noname]
Synagogue and bottle caps
A body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?
Pledge allegiance to the money now
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty
Like come with me, to the museum

[Transition: Noname & Chance The Rapper]
Excuse them, they know of what they do

[Verse 5: Chance The Rapper]
Sparring is training, don't let Denzel Training Day you
Sensei could catch a fade too
We be on that elegant, hella melanin
Pelle Pelles since they crayons and jelly pens

If you blink you might miss it
You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get the gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Life is short as a midget, but mine's a little LeBron
Been a minute since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize‚ mom invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more‚ I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like strongly scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone‚ we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippi Long
Can't stop, won't stop boppin' like Diddy's song
My next tour got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Backyard blasted, dance 'til it's grassless
Patio glass, the mazel tov cocktails
Bomb, b-bombastic, used to drop acid
Marli come soon, I only drop classics
Everyone ask
""When that heat gon' drop?""
""When that knee gon' drop?""
""When is he gon' pop the question we all got?""
""'Cause this could be y'all block
You're livin' in a glass house, we can see y'all clocks""
But I can see you from the other side, see y'all rocks
And we could've been Magneto, if you seen our locks
But we share it with the world, not just fans
Come out clean lookin' like we jumped the broom and the dustpan
So now it's here and we actin' out
Dame Dash, champagne in the back of Tao
Now I'm back in my bag and the cat is out
Burn a hole in my pocket like a Black & Mild (Igh)

[Verse 1]
My baby mama went celibate
Lies on my breath, she say she couldn't take the smell of it
Tired of the rumors, every room had an elephant
Tryna find her shoes, rummagin’ through the skeletons
She took away sex, took me out of my element
I tried to do the single-dad mingle-dance
At the club with the iron in my wrinkled pants
You could fall much faster than you think you can
Big hands for my ring, I'ma need a Pringles can
I just want the shine back like a Eagles fan
My ego like, ""Ah damn, there he go
Prayin' again, again, the same ol’ thang""
I mean, I ain't gon' promise that the pain go away
And you can take your sweet time, but she ain't gon' wait
'Cause a new coat of paint don't make the stain go away
But he go high (We love You, God)
And we go high
They go low, we go…
Higher, higher
[Verse 2]
My wife nanny like Fran Drescher
Three damn Grammys, my Granny like, ""No pressure""
So much style, my stylist got no dresser
Fuck goin' straight to the pros, I’m professor
Fuck bein’ one of the G.O.A.T.s, I'm Gotenks
Tried to try that with my girl, she ""No thanks""
Dropped the bomb, I couldn’t find a Tom Hanks
Got me pressed, tryin' to find DeVon Frank
Who the fuck rocked the boat? It's gon' sank
Shootin’ at me point blank with those blanks
They don't take teenage angst at no banks
(We love You, God)
Tried some new hues like Langston gon' paint
You gotta come harder than that

[Bridge]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It's two different things
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's two things (We love You, God)
It's too bad, and it's so sad

[Verse 3]
We give the glory to You, God
One livin' true God, You make us booyah
And throw up the Wu like U-God
They prop up statues and stones, try to make a new God
I don't need a EGOT, as long as I got You, God
Deep breathe, the woosah
Pretty sure I need You in this season like a flu shot
I just sit and wait like I'm with Kirsten when she shoe shop
Know you always with me like how Diddy be with Blue Dot
Got us movin' 'round without the straps like a tube-top
Got me big comfy like Molly's couch
Floatin' 'round the city like Malcolm X dolly'd out
They highly doubt, I guarantee it
This the part of my life my Lifetime movie prolly 'bout
When they come to jump a board, I won't ollie out
I too was once a snotty nose with a potty mouth
One day you get 1 OAK, then poppied out
And poppin' out don't seem as popular as just passin' out
When time get rationed out, you get rational
Folks become pageants inside the fashion house
They start to clash and you let 'em hash it out
But stay passive, so if they crash, you got a fastened belt (Huh)
Lord bless my lineage, let me be the skinniest
Let me get some time with him, let him know who Kenny is
Children born in one's youth are like arrows in the hands of a warrior
Well, I got an extendo with a long nose like Phineas
Kids proud like Penny is
BeBe & CeCe, I need like 20 twins
Got her in my family like Indian
Feel it in your gut like when you uppercut Ballchinians
Speakin' of guts, hers pokin' out like Winnie in the red shirt
I don't have to teach you a lecture about how sex works
I found out diamonds make pressure
I used to dive headfirst, just know I had to let go of the flesh first
It's true, God, this union was for You, God
We standin' at the stoop, we want to make it to the rooftop
You told us bring some people through, we tried to bring a few, God
We tried to form a new bond, just tell us what to do, God8Embed"

I can send you his contact, hit him if you in combat
Hit him if you in traffic, even if there ain't no static

My hair, he made it tangled
My seed, don't need no lining
A halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits, I'll tie his and let the kiddie rap

Happy Holidays

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
She could say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church
[Hook: Jamila Woods]
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church
[Bridge: Jamila Woods]
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
(*Mama you know it's gonna rain*)

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Mama you know, Mama you know its gonna rain
Father you know
Promised, you said it would rain, finally I'm home
You left on the light when I left on the flight, but I made it alright
I've been waiting all week, I've been waiting all night
Jason Van Dyke
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at Church on Sunday
Open Mike coming on Monday
I wonder what the internet gonna say
When SNL end with the Indie
Then the third tape slide down the chimney
Via Kirsten, Kinsley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy, Austin win the Emmy, Mama Jan too

[Intro]
Oh, no, no, no, no-no
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
[Verse 1]
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dogs and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don't think I felt ya hand on my head, yelling: ""Call his father""?
But people don't hear ghosts, so how they gon' play me?
Money saved me, so I'ma do the same thing
You're droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like, how you got the drive, but don't know how to use a stick shift?
You better not miss this, overdose, dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Blast off

[Verse 2]
Dropping tapes 'til I losted count, coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib, I'm falling down
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around
[Bridge]
Oh, non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh, je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave
Non laisse-moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent. Vous ne pensez qu'à ça

[Chorus]
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
(Oh, it's, oh, it's been so long)
Since I've seen you smile
(It's been so long)

Well we must be some zanies and fools
To  take a gamble on this love just like we do
What  a wonderfully crazy thing to do
Love like magnets, we were powerless to choose
I'm so powerful every time I look at you
No  memory of anything I couldn't do
It's  possible, so possible

Once upon a time I was unsure of myself
I would always claim I never had no help
Looking to the mirror, the most unfair of all
Hit  the Player's Ball, it was unbearable
Another big birthday, another milestone
To make your birthstone feel like rhinestone
The caterpillars that had burrowed inside my belly
Started to flutter before I learned how to fly
I had a bunch of midlife crises 'fore I turned twenty-five
The teachers put me in the back row, I was learning to hide
'Cause when the teachers call you special, that's the perfect disguise
I had to bury all the dancing that would burgeon inside
I got quiet, thought that silence was the perfect reply
I turn to Casper any time a nigga turn on the slide
Until I turned up at the talent show, a permanent high
I had Jesus behind the wheel before I learned how to drive
'Cause it's poss'...

Once upon a time, a lady who tried twice
At being a good wife and giving a good life
To both of her lil' girls with ballerina tights
She called up the RE/MAX and opened her own site
Closing open houses, hired her own type
Alimony is phony, she paid for her own flights
Crazy office parties, she's throwin' 'em inside
And my mama sealed my fate when she opened the invite
The lady had a plan, she knew it all in advance
The party was a good mixture of employees and friends
She told the people comin' to make sure they bring their kids
Yeah, bring some food, but just make sure you bring your kids
After we arrived and after standing around
The lady tinked her glass and told us, ""Gather around""
For a special performance from her daughters, she said it proud
""But tonight they not my daughters, tonight they Destiny's Child""
Out from the back came three lil' survivors
In formation, choreo tighter
One on the left, I think I might like her
One on the left, I think I might love her
Lady just folds her arms, rubs her hands
All of the lessons learned, how to dance
All of these moments left up to chance
Everything will go right as it can
It's possible

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Once upon a time, I had carats supplied
To a pair of fair rings I would share with the bride
Every kiss begins with Claire's cut clarity size
They were forever, but marriage had an apparent decline
Now we live in fear of doin' what our parents was tryin'
So every Rapunzel don't got the kind of hair you can climb
Ever since they lost a slipper, every pair that they find
They say these boots were made for dancing like Mary J. Blige
We live a life apart, life so hard
Life'll never really end up like the start
We learned together how the back door feels
And we was jumping over brooms in tobacco fields
We was the same, all black folks still
Until the white man found out black votes steal elections
So they legitimized us, but behind us
It's still black folks at the back door still
For every small increment liberated, our women waited
And all they privacy been invaded
Almost every trait I got through the slave owner gone
Skin brown, nose round, but the Bennett made it
Now I wanna give it to her, Sierra Leone, serenade
Sometimes love come with its own barricade
Sometimes love just gotta hold, marinate
Let it hold, let it wait, here it go, here it go

Ayy, yo
Once upon a time, a girl from Trinidad
Had to fly to Canada and sneak into the land
Of the free and of the brave, feet under the sand
And I came in realizing nothing free in the land
Dreams of making money, had to split it with Sam
All that Making the Band, yeah, I could've did it, but damn
Rather really be on the come-up, had to stick to the plan
Went from rockin' with Fendi, now Fendi know I'm a brand
That's how God do, I'm in your top two
And I ain't number two, conquered rap, then the pop too
You gon' stop who? Get off cock, boo
Since ""Itty Bitty Piggy,"" giving bitches what they bop to
I met my husband when I was seventeen out in Queens
If you love it, let it go, now I know what that means
While he was up North for a body
I bodied everybody and got known for my body
My nigga home now, he the Clyde to my Bonnie
'Bout to walk down the aisle and be a mommy
Ooh, I remember when I cried like, ""Why me?""
Now I wouldn't exchange my life for Armani
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming and then it hits me
Gotta remember who I am when it slips me
Kids running up to the car yelling, ""Nicki""
All my bad bitches, I know that y'all with me
Fuck they thought was sittin' in my seat?
Got a big bowl of ice cream sitting in my Jeep
Got some killers that'll put you on ice, so don't sleep

Don't you know that side niggas can't cop no Tesla?
Pull up in a ring like wrestlers
Hop out at the soccer game with the VVS's and a bunch of snacks
Model X Falcon, backseat, doing jumping jacks
20-1-9, I want it one of a kind
2020, I'ma be ahead of my time
Twenty thousand leagues, the biggest fish in the pond
But if you never go fishing, it's something you'll never find

We can be (Eternal), eternal (Forever and ever)
We can be (Eternal), eternal (Eternal, baby, we can be eternal, baby)

[Verse 2: Smino]
I know some shawties that'll blast for me over blasphemy
And throw that ass for me, so molasses-ly
Huh, slow motion so I had to see
Before you start, fill my glass, wipe my glasses
I love her passion, ooh (Sweet)
I drunk her passionfruit (Sweet)
I'm runnin' through your organs like when a pastor hoop
I wanna pass the ball, I don't pass the ball
I'm Kobe, baby, I ate it up
I ain't ate all month, you lookin' like a plate of lunch
Said her her name was Angie and she love to get stoned
Almost fell in love, I hurt my heart from these songs
Tourmaline on, she can feel it in the stones
Huh, now she giving me ultimatums
I told her I hate tomatoes, some chances, I gotta take 'em
I can't see for the life of me
Why all these hoes like me when I got wifey?
Side chicks can't do flat twists
Bet a dollar you could buy me a Brisk (Yeah, yeah)
Side chicks can't cook no grits
Grits, nigga, grits
[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
We can be (Eternal), eternal (Forever and ever)
We can be (Eternal), eternal (Eternal, baby, we can be eternal, baby)

[Refrain: Chance the Rapper]
Side chicks can't dance like this, uh
Side niggas can't dance like this, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six-month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed!
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
'Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seein' summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seein' summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
'Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav'
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, ""Give my nigga back!""

[Chorus: Akenya Seymour & Chance the Rapper]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down (With my windows down)
[Verse 2: Alex Wiley]
Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable, yelling ""Fuck a school""
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal
Tryna get a mill, tell 'em that
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real white nigga man mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke all out
Drink 'til I fall out, fuck is you talkin' 'bout boy
The Village is my brothers
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'
Hella love for Chance The Rapper
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God

[Chorus: Akenya Seymour & Chance The Rapper]
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Uh, this is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street
For the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller?
But I'ma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her
Inhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses
So, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do
But its still save money like a coupon
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on

I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
I thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door-knocker, down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father, you just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chance The Rapper]
First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up
[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & Daniel Caesar]
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes, yeah
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
Alright
Spirit's moving now

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass
Send my Tweet, fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know
[Pre-Chorus 1: Chance The Rapper]
First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up

Have a dream and then never wake up

Here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the seams snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'
'Til the dream happens, I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like
Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters
And black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin', knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings
[Pre-Chorus 2: Chance The Rapper]
Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up

Here it comes,  ready or not, ready or not

Adidas influence Nike, I do's it
Coolin' with Mikey, low-key I rock
Mags on my bike, Tay like he chuck
Hockey I puck, Rockie, I fresh
Saki, my cup, like Rocky, ""Wassup""
Ooh he got two weeks ten with the foolie
Doobie sawbuck, school be too huff
Caleb my nigga, Fresco my nigga
Gon head send it up, SAVEMULA too tough

Wavy, so wavy, trendin', I'm trendy
Bending these pennies mommy done gave me
Business so savvy, savey, no spendy
Drifty so empty, city so windy
Master champ Chancelor, TrapMan the Chance or
Vance the bag handler, Bagger Vance
Pants is baggy, Vans rancid, band of bad bandits
Abandoned bandanas, banned from band practice
Sentence so gavel, wordplay so Scrabble
Chance to split atoms slit Adam apples
Adamant Chano rat-a-tat vandals
Had to have at em' as an example

That shit cray, that shit dead, that shit fake, plastic head
Cassius Clay at his head, atta boy, atta kid
I'ma need a napkin, cook 'em up
And he gon' need an Aspirin, hook him up
Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, ""What up?"" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive

This shit fit me like a damn glove
Shit cleaner than a hand scrub
Feel better than DJ Khaled fan love
This the rock that gave pride to a man cub
Ain't no love in hip-hop
There ain’t no keepin' up with the Bennetts
Ain't no diamonds in the chain but it’s in the pendant
I only own fishbowls, but my rentals tinted
You know I'm used to movin' units like a rental tenant
Real lieutenant, God's army
He like a doctor, he'll never let a shot harm me
I'm a force in the field, I never take damage
I create panic 'cause niggas wanna act fake satanic
And the labels get straight frantic
Their boardrooms look like eight Channing Tatums and a Peyton Manning
And they all been married
They celebrate anniversaries and nurseries and try to play Santa
But they don't sell marriage no more
Guess bein’ all alone ain’t so scary no more (Guess not)
Guess our lives ain't for sharin’ no more
Guess the tale can't end like a fairy no more, but...

Anything is possible if Gucci can do it (It’s Gucci)
Tractor trailer full of kush, bet Gucci could move it
Used to drive a Buick, now a Rolls Royce (Right)
I'm the young hoes' choice that make the old hoes moist
All these millions separate all the men from the boys
All these wars I went through, felt like a soldier deployed
I'm the trap god but I give the glory to God
It's a knife on my K and my tongue is a sword
I'm the plug and the cord, get it all in accord
White rings seasick, Gucci went overboard
Hublot surfboard, brought sand to the beach
All white tux on, brought the church to the streets (It's Gucci)

Only one friend in the whole wide world
One day will come when you only have each other
Never give it up for a boy or a girl
We come in peace but we don't come in pieces
We on some tag-team WWE shit
We look just alike, the prestige is so prestigious
The splitting image of Lupita standing on them beaches
Don't tweak and don't be facetious
Those shells'll shred you to pieces
These niggas faking like demons
But I'ma send 'em to Jesus (It's just me and my bro)
Versus all of you heathens
They think I'm reading Ephesians
I have all these niggas hiding, avoiding meetings like vegans
I got the keys like I'm Keegan
I'll line the trunk with the bleach
And I'll leave you inside the freezer and let you chill for the weekend
But forget over the weekend and come back inside a month
And I throw you inside the trunk but it's plastic so it ain't leakin'

Me and Chano like Peschi and Robin's life

You just makin' the song hype
I really snapped, the last time I rapped I was movin' packs
In adolescence, seen ambulances, learned other lessons
Catchin' blessings, overstretchin' from first-hand impressions
Chano called my phone voicemail, hope he don't get a message
Heard that I exit from my axis off that intersection
So if you say somethin' 'bout big bro, bitch, I'ma smack you reckless
We from down south, we bogus twice and we are not from Texas
One more rep, can't run around strapped, so I walk around like pedestrian
Chi-town summer lookin' like my numbers, and you know how I'm bomin', ain't checkin' it
Called big bro, now we run it up, set it up, get it up, nigga, now let's begin
OTF, free Durk and them
We was inside with a curfew then
What's fire without earth and wind?
And what's a fight when it's worth the win? Yeah6Embed"

[Verse]
22 Offs
I'm off the nog, I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local, I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my momma's Volvo
Watching the garage burn down, I'm off the codo
I'm off the top, I'm off some pot, I'm off Ciroc, I'm off a lot
They gave me 10 days off, that's an awful lot
I was off campus but the officer
Told the office that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave while rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me gon' rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught? Picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups? Why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me, yeah? Well, that's awfully fair
All for nothing, tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch, I ain't scared, I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends the next coffin is theirs
Guess what, bitch? I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops to tweak so I can offer 'em years
Have me tweaking like I'm all full of fear (Alright, I'm tweaking)22Embed"

Don't ask me for no I.D., bitch, I fucking signed out
Bitch, I've been suspended, bitch, I've been on timeout
Waking up in grind mode and sleeping in a grindhouse
So please don't hit my line 'bout the party trying to find out
What time that shit going to start
Or when it end, or who gon' come out
Or if I walked the stage
I've been on stage since I could rhyme out
Shows and shows and tapes
Of trying to get my fucking lines out
So please don't take my BIC out, my book out, my pick out
My hair, my fucking big mouth, you dick head, you dipped out
Of class and now you shit out of luck, who fucking slick now?
And with them rhymes you written down
I hope you get a mixdown
With a diss track from Ms. Rownd
And my dick sack in this bitch mouth
Give a five-hive to my teacher face
And my principal that fist pound
And now you gotta switch gowns

I'll hit you with that 6-piece: bink, bink, bink, bink, bink, bink
I hear your pockets jingling
It's calling me like ""Ring, ring""
I'll choke you with your bling bling
Then run faster than Tink Tink
And all these goofies mad though
Like, ""Why he such a asshole?""
And I ain't even mad, yo, I'll stab you with a screwdriver
That shit ain't even rhyme, nigga
I'm fucked up out my mind, nigga
I stay right off the '9, nigga
That's where they try an' find a nigga
Feeling froggy? Better timid up
Harsh feelings gone, put 'em in a blunt
'Cause niggas don't wanna get bended up
Stay talking but don’t send it up
Used to send it up for my Skinner lunch

Please don't let my death be about my death
Please don't make no movies about my death
Please make my death about my life
If you make a movie 'bout my life, make it right
Please don't make no holograms, don't wanna do it twice
You wanna use my likeness, please approve it through my wife
And if you get the license then you better use it right
Don't misconstrue my offerings to offer new advice
If I said it, I meant it
If I'm dead, it's cemented
And cinder block cemeteries already ascended
I'll leave you my last name I left on the last plane
Too much baggage but you can carry on Bennett
I just wanna make sure that my words touch you
Pinky swear and kiss it
Promise no one'll hush you
Jump and hit the blocks, I promise you'll see the mushroom
Clouds and the dust soon
Leavin' more thoughts than there are bristles on a brush broom

I don't want nobody to be at my wedding
That won't be there for my marriage

They can like it, they can share it
Like, ""Look at that lil' dress and how she wear it
I thought that pregnant belly prolly tear it""
""You know they only did this shit for money""
""I know one day that they just gon' co-parent""
""I gotta zoom in, count up all the carats""
""I know that nigga probably went to Jared""
""I know that nigga probably so embarrassed""
But they don't know nothin', baby
That's why I tell you when I say it, I say
Don't look down, don't look down
When they, when they try and make up all that bullshit
I just tell you
Don't look down, don't look down
And when we goin' towards the sky, when we get into that atmosphere

But people don't hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?

Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it

Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns

And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib, I'm falling down
I'm on the floor, crawling 'round

Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around""

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Ayy, call me Young Mister, Mister Tongue Twister
Niggas couldn't touch the flow if they was playing Twister, right
A minute in it, they turn to Sonny Liston, right
It's plenty of pullin' up, I'm gettin' blisters
Ever since I kissed her
Everyone seem like they got something to say
Like the day after the big day
Is supposed to be super bad like we won't stay
It's supposed to be super scary like we don't pray
We treat the bad advice like bad breath
Either give a compliment or couple mints, depends what we have left
Findin' good news in the bad press
Tell 'em break a leg like an actress, hit with a jab step
1-9 love, that's forever, it'll never stop
1-9 Love, that's a record I'll never drop, uh
1-9 love, that's a one time love
That's a one time, one time, every time it'll be the
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever
[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox & Chance the Rapper]
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with (Take it all with), a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me (Leave it all up to me), I got you always

[Chorus: Ari Lennox  & Chance the Rapper]
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always and forever, ever
Always, always (I got you, oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
It's been a minute, I've been messin' with ya, I could never switch up
Turn my life around, I'm tryna go to Heaven with ya
I would sit there in the waiting room together with ya
Magazines, pat my jeans, have a beverage with ya
Count my blessings with ya
They prefer success less than when we stress, bet
Forget about all the drama and the comments they left
Out rightly fine, the bottom line is right on top of they text
You gotta remember that the enemy is not of the flesh
You gotta remember that our imagery is made from the best
So pray for the best
Hands high, caught the garter, caught the Hail Mary
Married, tossed the veil, moved to Fort Lauderdale
1-9 to 9-1, that's the goal
9-1 dash, that's the soul
Can't keep track of lies that they told
So extra in the background, that's they role, but
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever
[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox & Chance the Rapper]

We can't blame them, it's all just by design

You gotta schedule vacations in your five-year plan
You gotta schedule celebrations in your five-year plan
You gon' have several revelations in your first five days
In your first five minutes, have your first five fans
For like forty-five minutes, take your first shift break
There's no time for impatience in your five-year plan
You got time for hesitation in your five-year plan
A lot of shit came at you in a five-year span
If you followed your flight plan, you'd be right here prayin'
Eyes closed, right now sayin', Lord of Lords
I know you gave abundantly, even gave up your son for me
No need for sacrifice in my plans
And I love to say your name, it come from my diaphragm
I just had to scare 'em off and draw a line in the sand
Anything you gave to me, they couldn't pry from my hands
Anything you gave to me, I know it's right for my brand
I know shortcuts cut short long runs
I seen niggas on one try the wrong one
Get trunked, sing the same song, Ken Jeong swung
Giant mistakes on fee fi foenem
Probably keep both of 'em, you got time for missteppin'
Time for them weapons, formed but not prosper
Time for them lessons, time for them blessings
Time for first, second, third, fourth impressions
Time for reflection, time for confession
Time will heal all, let's get a good stretch in
[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
Things that's in the way of my goal
Things that eat away at my heart
That's just, just the way of the art
I know that I had a good start
I wish I could play a guitar
I, I  know that I'm gonna be
Better than I ever was
I told 'em they gonna see
I just want everybody ta
Love, love, love

[Interlude: Randy Newman]
Time has, time has come
Time has, time has come
To be who you are
Be who you are

To take it all in, take it all in

Know who you are

Who's that in the back of the back?
You deserve a plaque and a pat on the back
I see y'all in your suits like the Cat in the Hat
With the clean black slacks and the jacket to match
Found your way back like a Cadillac with the flats
Came around like satellite, down like a battle axe
Why do you word insure me like it's Aflac?
I don't know, why do birds Burt Bacharach?
Why do worms prefer habitats?
Why did it occur where it happened at?
Why ain't no apples in Apple Jacks?
Are you ready for The Big Day?
I don't know, but you're well on your way

[Outro: Randy Newman]
Somebody hurt you really bad
And you don't know what to do

What to get the man who has everything?
Tryna fit myself into a schedule and a wedding ring
Tryna eat everything
I was raised, it come across my plate, then I better swing
Tryna turn Confederate flags into confetti strings
I'm tryna back up my baby mama like Kevin Federline
Heard they got some nice-ass houses out there in Beverly
Never leave where I came from
I just need me some stockings
And the chimney they could hang from
Photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
Christmas cards so gorgeous, other families wanna frame one
Real talk, I need a front yard, a backyard
A side yard, a side yard, inside bar, a dry bar
Nine cars and a garage, and it's on hella acres
I'm tired of people visitin', takin' the elevator
Well, we'll keep the elevator

[Chorus]
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

[Verse 2]
Don't gifts get re-wrapped?
That shit could get sticky like tree sap
I gave you free raps, that shit sound like free facts
Which is 'bout as common as free blacks
Stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
Look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
And once the debris drops, the streets 400 degrees hot
Please, man, we needin' some freeze pops
What in the world for the man who has everything?
Man, West Chatham Park could use some better swings
Used to be disheveled, I went and shoveled everything
Tell Santa to show up to doors he never ring
He never ring

Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
That's all I ask
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

[Verse 3]
That baby is a genius
Don't teach him 'bout Santa 'til you teach him 'bout Jesus
Don't take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
I swear, it's enough leisure in this world to get lost
What's the point of gainin' chicken if you lose all the sauce?
What's the point of gainin' chicken if it can't get across?
Lost the cold hard cash, they said, ""Damn, that boy soft""
Same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin' coin toss
I guess I cleaned up, Santa don't miss no names but I miss Fatimah
It's been a minute since I've seen her
Them the type of things I hate to bring up, just like the prenup
That shit be see-through like John Cena, Aquafina
But like the Christmas tape, there's things that I gotta get clear
Like my papa ask the same question every year
""What to get for my boy who has everything?""
I said, ""I'll take anything but everything,"" you know?

Light up, Hot Wheels, locked up, wrong steamer
Dreamer, long Bimmers, our neighbors their, lawns greener
We wrestle with envy, then act up, John Cena
Chancellor Bennett, referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges
Cigarette stained smile, all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
Getting hyped up off them bad bitches on it
Getting knocked up off a nigga, bad luck
Getting scared now with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I didn’t add up
That I didn’t get yet, but they think that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I got it
And if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied
It was really, really ill, I know a nigga held up
Hell yeah I’ll always get a pic with y’all niggas
Word to my fans, all six of y'all niggas
I seen all the tweets and the tips from y’all niggas
Got hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas
Loving your love, an album to come
I bet that you love it, comes out in a month
Chance, the astounding class clown
That turned out to amount into something, 3001

Knock knock said the fist to the world
Shine sun through the mist and debris
Bang bang said the fist to the young
Silence from the lips of the free
Say something important, say something important
Make money the end of the week
But that shit coming soon, I’m getting hungry
Might sell out in a couple of weeks
But my crib they buckin’
And they just called Buddy, that’s lil bro
Even though last time we spoke
We was arguing, but we still stay close
Ask God to watch the squad
On God, battle niggas to the death, alright
Fuck your squad and the whole facade
I ain’t never scared of where a nigga reside
Extra mild sauce on the side, extra mileage on the ride
Express, I'mma grab my chain
Cause it’s extra violence all on the nine
Ten days, that’s an awful lot
Eleven squares in like fifteen minutes
Sixteens when that album comes
Spit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!

You was there, you just wasn't there in time
Turns out she the marryin' kind
Very smart and she very fine, and she very kind
Gimme kisses in her spare time
And she's very mine
With her hair up in a bun, she surprise me with the lunch
She just tell me when it's done, it's Aries sign
I be cryin' in the club, like this birthday is a dub
Okay this birthday is a dub now where's my boo?
Twenty/twenty, twenty/twenty vision, I see you

Now what you witnessed was the turn, was the pledge
The prestige, you can feel it in the breeze, turn the bird to debris
Turn the fur to thin air, it's a thousand degrees, set it free
I prefer if you pop lock with me

Slow motion (Motion, motion)
What you witnessed is a girl and a man
Coming together in love

[Intro: Chance the Rapper]
Yolo nigga, yolo everything
Yolo car, yolo car radio
Look me up in the yolo pages nigga, igh

[Verse 1]
Hey, Ya! When the fuck you gonna grow up?
When that money gonna show up?
Thought that 10 Day shit would blow up
Got you stressed, ripping your 'fro up
Smokin' squares, fuckin' your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya, they critically acclaim ya
Used to criticize your mistakes, ""Mr. Bennett's Mr. Famous""
Mrs. Rownd just heard your mixtape, ""the misogynistic mischief""
You the reason for the mishaps, and should keep coming up missing
You're a top dog; you the top, dog
They can't even catch up; you so hot, dog
And it feels good, and it feels dope
You still steal shit, cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop, really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop, but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you won a Grammy, if you end up in the Hall of Rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top
Got 99 problems, got a 100 to the drugs
I should finish up this verse, but you know I don't give a fuck
YOLO!
[Hook]
Yo-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, YOLO (x5)

[Verse 2]
Shouts out my juice, bitch, my cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit, my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick, igh, bitch, suck my dack
I been riding 'round in that steamer with that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck, but now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? What do you think of fuck fest?
You ever had a foursome? You ever been a suspect?
You ever passed the fuck out? You ever failed a drug test?
I learned from getting bumped that bumping Ye could make it be okay
All that jumping, dunking shit can't make a 3 go way
I been up inside the stu' for fucking three whole days
Yelling, ""Fuck the cops, it ain't nothing to box""
So somebody pour me another shot like SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, Drop, drop, drop, drop
Give a fuck, fuck that-that Is you going, dot, dot, dot?

This is just business, see you right after
Nothing comes before ya, nothing else matters
All of this is for ya, you are all that matters

[Verse]
I dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road
If I ain’t toured then we still’d be broke
Thought I got the formula, bon appetite
I got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak
Wise beyond my years but way behind my peak
You gotta eat, this a step to my princess
Point of interest, fourth and inches
Hallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd cheered the child
Booya, mic drop, I walk home

Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse

My heart and tongue are fighting, my mind is undecided
It's not like Trump and Biden, it's more like something private
Like when your cousins fighting, one of 'em get excited
You can't just jump the gun and pick a side and jump inside it
Remember, Pontius Pilate hung a God and justified it
The truth is slow 'cause someone's always in a rush to hide it
The lies is golden 'cause the Devil got a touch of Midas
The soul is brighter 'cause the Holy Ghost is ultraviolet
The tongue is violent when the spirit starts to hunger-striking
The thunder lightning makes the heart go under bunkers hiding
The lungs is silent when it hears the footsteps of the giants
And then, the fingertips, they twist up like Poseidon's trident
Remember safety if you ever running from the tight end
Remember Mookie if they ever come to cut the hydrant
They cut the heart out with the tongue, they want it undivided
You better not start, you make a fuss you end up uninvited

My heart and mind are beefing, I call 'em ""rhyme and reason""
They always going head to head, I'm tryna Siamese 'em

He told me faith and squinted eyes can turn the blind Venetian

I seen the wine, I seen the water turn to bright Tahitian

Tying pigeons to the giant peaches

They buy our leaders easier than I can buy a feature

Redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there
We ain't got no worries

[Verse 1]
D. Rose on that ass, that means back again
I hit my Zan so hard
Man, I've been practicing
I'm going straight to the league, and not by accident
Don't get your ass kicked in
I'll hoop in Shaqs and Timbs
Chit chat with Chris Mintz-Plasse
And laugh at Jags and rims
T-T-Y-L-ing the labels and L-O-L-ing they friends
Hello Hell and Heaven, you haven't heard the half of it
Have at it half-happy
30-something year old, broke graduate
Over the wave like du-rags,getting paper like dude rap
Nineteen, making that ""I could be damn near fucking Erykah Badu"" rap
Girbaud flow is too strapped
My screws loose, I'm too slapped
Just got this bitch too turnt
Just got my nose 2Pac'd
L.A Reid like, ""Who's that?
Jimmy Iovine like, ""Who's that?
Whole world like, ""Who's that?
Whole hood like ‘dude ass’
I'm from little shorties with the shot up shirt
Where babies get kilt like a Scottish skirt
95-ing down the Ryan
And I'm flying, skirrt
Keep on asking if I'm trying niggam I ain't word
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Unreluctant optimist, most poppingest
Got popular,try topping this, Triceratops
BJs from baby bopping bitches
Throat lozenges
Massaging it, no touching it
Okay, touch on it
But don’t rush on it
Ration it, passionate
While imagining me smashing it
Dash out at like 4:30,hands smelling like potpourri
They ain’t give my nigga no jury, so I don’t give no nigga no mercy
When my little fucking brother rap better than you
My shit get your girl way wetter than you
You rap veterans you, my nerdy brethren you
Stuff you in a fucking locker, 10 Day letterman you
You wanna jock me, jockers (AAH)
My style’s fathering you
I know it’s bothering you
Probably an anomaly
But it’s probably niggas that’s probably starving for new shit you could sound like
That’s that shit that I don’t like
But I ain’t really worried
I’m a wordy motherfucker
I could hurry
But I’m buried in her pussy from the last tape

Love is the life 'round here
We're never done

Part time love

[Verse: Chance the Rapper]
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute
Here ain't been 'round my whole life
Mike ain't spin 'round in a minute
The sand just dropped for the last time
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
Light ain't been 'round here in a minute
Darkness been swallowed it up
Chaos been 'round for a minute
Marketed, bottled it up
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
I ain't been 'round here in a minute
But here ain't been round a whole lot
My flesh looked through the peephole
Seen his people, sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked
Life can't be here, indefinite
Not another minute 'round here
Why can't a minute be spent in a town that's nowhere round here?
But wear that fake smile like a cape

I got three babies, and everyone know it
Rac', Monroe and a little Golden

And a little poet, I think that I win
I hope that you and Mariah split up them twins

Split up them twins, we gone all the time
I see them everyday that I can rhyme

[Chance The Rapper]
Every I rhyme, I do my lines
I think you should stick down to drumline

[Nick Cannon]
Stick to drumline, I got more movies tho
Matter a fact I just did three in a row

[Chance The Rapper]
Three in a row and I think that that's perfect
But I think you should take off that damn turban

[Nick Cannon]
Take off this turban, man how can you say that
I don't even know because you don't wanna play that
I'll take you down, this is my crown
Rapping from New York, now how that sound
[Chance The Rapper]
It's going down, I came to play
I came to clown, I came to say
I think it's cool that you play lockers
That you play.... is that soccer?

[Nick Cannon]
Yes I play soccer
And you know feel it
Because when I kick it I pick up and kill it
Man you gone deal with it
Man I'm just spill with it
Nick Cannon the realest and you know that I'm the illest so...

Pick up and kill it and kill it and kill it

[Chance The Rapper]
I am not one of them goofy ass niggas
I think that you take off pants with them zippers
I know that I am the coolest, the realest
And I can go realer, I'm from Chi-Town
When I do my shit, I never write down
I'm off the top and I'm wearing my crown

They used to though.
On the other side was a mansion on a hill,
Complete with LA pools and fireplaces,
And a rim made specifically for people who lie about being six feet to dunk on,
Where a piano was for decoration and an old record player was actually for the hoes,
I was never awakened by the twisting of a door knob,
Benzo’s kissed me goodnight,
The bars finally stopped working,
They used to though.
On the other side was a presidential suite,
Complete with living rooms and empty beds and a rainfall showered fixture and the freedom to smoke big dope,
And smoking fees also,
And the possibility of making a beautiful girl I just met, map out in her mind just how many times her apartment could fit in this room,
If I could just get in.
The card stopped working,
They used to though.
On the other side was a family,
Complete with carpet stains and big loves and “its your turn’s"" and toys all over the place
(I almost fell and broke my fucking neck),
And responsibility and refrigerator magnets,
And days on the couch and nights on the couch,
And lines drawn in the sand and comebacks that cross the line,
And a horn line from my favourite make-up song plays,
And just like that, we've rehabbed a home,
DeBarge stopped working.
I still have all the keys that are of no use to me
They used to work though.6Embed"

We want some heroes in our story
We need highlights for a nightlight, we need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks
Bombs bursting in air
Oh say
Can you see America's face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some more for us
Save the date
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bobs and Cousin Skeeters
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
You want to see a hero? You need a teammate

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side

And now that we made it
Came in with an angel around us
Put it all in what we doing next
Ooo you know we can't go without it
Never go alone it never lasts
So we get to make what we want
Home has come at last
Yeaaa

I should be downtown, trippin on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is this that got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinions on me
I was only gone for the last two months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Hook]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do
But that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're throwing dirt on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it

[Post-Hook]
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
Cause you don't mean them anyway
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
[Verse 2]
We need to breathe
There's more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me
We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be
But that just didn't sit well with me
Tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Throwing dirt on my name, in public
You don't feel no way, on purpose
I'm messing up all of Drake's words, on purpose.. careful
Careful
Be careful
Be careful
You could never be too careful

(I'm not a singer but BBC got me up very early in the morning)

[Verse 3]
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way

Feel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way

I know the words  (IGH, IGH, IGH!)
I know the words
Haven't you heard?
New album alert
This shit loud as the purp
We out in the burbs  (huh)
Out of the streets, we was out on the curb
From out of the dirt, a mountain emerged
A willow was birthed
It's alright, I wept, I prayed on it, slept on it, wait on it (IGH, IGH!)
Just flame up with Tunechi, you know that you Gucci
Just somethin' to say on it  (huh, huh)
Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney (huh)
My pop's in the mirror, Mufasa is in me
I ain't no goofie (I ain't no goofie)
I ain't no goofie
I am the re-up, I am the plug, you can't introduce me (who is you?)

I know my daddy (huh), you can tell when I speak I got his name (huh)
I'm on my business (I'm on my business)
I'm not in the business, I'm not a prisoner
I got my soul (I got my soul)
I flaunt, I wear it, I'm still a Christian, I still got hitters (I still got hitters)
Reese and Justin a phone call away
They say no delay, and ándale! they on the way
Catch me in the city on the Divvy with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Need a little scratch but the tours itch
Proud to go where the pot of gold too rich

Yo, it's the return of the Gifted Gifter
The Secret Santa grab-bag sifter
The Grinch, sleigh hanging off the ledge deadlifter
The best thrifter, the tearjerker
The Santa's little help employee of the year worker
The smile bringer, the joy inside the child lingers
The boy inside the crowd proud, he's a loud singer
The whole choir, the bow tier
The snowplow and the snow tires, the coat buyer
The ""Oh, you shouldn't have""-r, the Birkin bagger
The gifted rapper, they told me it's the thought that counts
But really it's the count that matters, accounting hacker
Bank amount countin' backwards, a thousand smackers
It's the return of Kris Kringle, the piss singles, that shit tingles
Sendin' checks twice 'cause the name's on the list wrinkled
My chips Pringles, my chips been gold
My green mean go, your green mean slow
It's the young born again, good hood ornament
With a little chicken like a Cornish hen, Amazon ordering
Cohiba importer of Evergreen water in
Rapping all night, will he ever bring the chorus in?
Fireplace bright like I threw ten menorahs in
Ten more kinaras and a whole fucking forest, then
I buy the doll in the mall that the store is in
I hide the presents in the dresser and the drawer it's in
My dawg doin' moves, he said this shit is on the floor again
Feds was on his trail but he got fifty names in Oregon
I bought cases bigger than the suits that you see Lori in
James still sittin' but I'm sendin' a DeLorean
Look, it's Mister Christmas Bonus
Mister Made His Brothers Bands, Mister Nich'las Jonas
Mister Big Cojones but bigger heart
That's where the homeless home is
The Home Alone kid
It's the return of Kevin McCallister, the Swiss mister
The hot chocolate mixer that gets pictures
And big, big cousin misser, the quick fixer
The Wiz Oz, big blizzard, the big gifter
