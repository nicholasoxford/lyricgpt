Oh my God, Ronny

[Verse 1]
Ayy, somebody grab him some clippers (Zzzzt)
His fuckin' beard is weird
Tough talk from a rapper payin' millions for security a year
""I think my dad's gone crazy,"" yeah, Hailie, you right
Dad's always mad cooped up in the studio, yellin' at the mic
You're sober and bored, huh? (I know)
'Bout to be forty-six years old, dog
Talkin' 'bout ""I'ma call up Trick Trick""
Man, you sound like a bitch, bitch
Man up and handle your shit (Ugh)
Mad about somethin' I said in 2012
Took you six years and a surprise album just to come with a diss (Huh)
Homie, we get it, we know that you're the greatest rapper alive
Fuckin' dweeb, all you do is read the dictionary and stay inside
Fuck ""Rap God,"" I'm the Rap Devil
Comin' bare-faced with a black shovel
Like the Armageddon when the smoke settle
His body next to this instrumental, I'm sayin'

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it (Ayy)
[Verse 2]
Let's talk about the fact you actually blackballed a rapper
That's twice as young as you (Let's talk about it)
Let's call Sway
Ask why I can't go up to Shade 45 because of you (Brrt)
Let's ask Interscope
How you had Paul Rosenberg tryin' to shelf me (Huh?)
Still can't cover up the fact
Your last four albums is as bad as your selfie
Now tell me, what do you stand for? (What?)
I know you can't stand yourself (No)
Tryin' to be the old you so bad, you Stan yourself (Ha)
Let's leave all the beefin' to 50 (Please)
Em, you're pushin' fifty
Why you claimin' that I'ma call Puff
When you the one that called Diddy? (Facts)
Then you went and called Jimmy (Facts)
They conference called me in the morning (What?)
They told me you mad about a tweet
You wanted me to say sorry (What?)
I swear to God I ain't believe him (Nah)
Please say it ain't so (No)
The big bad bully of the rap game can't take a fuckin' joke
Oh, you want some fuckin' smoke (What?)
But not literally, you'll choke
Yeah, I'll acknowledge you're the G.O.A.T
But I'm The Gunner, bitch, I got you in the scope (Brrah)
Don't have a heart attack now (No)
Somebody help your mans up (Help)
Knees weak of old age, The Real Slim Shady can't stand up
[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it

[Verse 3]
Hello Marshall, my name's Colson
You should go back to Recovery (Wouh)
I know your ego is hurtin'
Just knowin' that all of your fans discovered me (Hi)
He like, ""Damn, he a younger me
Except he dresses better and I'm ugly
Always making fun of me""
Stop all the thuggery, Marshall, you livin' in luxury (Ayy)
Look what you done to me
Dropped an album just because of me
Damn, you in love with me
You got money but I'm hungry
I like the diss but you won't say them lyrics out in front of me
Shout out to every rapper that's up under me
Know that I'll never do you like this fuckery
Still bitter after everyone loves you
Pull that wedgie out your dungarees (Ayy)
I gotta respect the OGs and I know most of 'em personally (Ayy)
But you're just a bully actin' like a baby
So I gotta read you a nursery (Pussy)
I'm the ghost of the future
And you're just Ebenezer Scrooge (Facts)
I said on Flex anyone could get it
I ain't know it would be you
[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)
Or we could get gully, I'll size up your body and put some white chalk around it
[Bridge]
Ayy, ridin' shotty 'cause I gotta roll this dope
It's a fast road when your idols become your rivals, yeah
Never hesitate to say it to your face, I'm an asshole
Bitch-ass motherfucker
Oh my God, Ronny
Fuck Kells

[Verse 4]
We know you get nervous, Rabbit
I see Mama's spaghetti all over your sweater
I wish you would lose yourself on the records
That you made a decade ago, they were better
Accordin' to them, you're a national treasure
To me, you're as soft as a feather
The type to be scared to ask Rihanna for her number
Just hold her umbrella-ella-ella
""I'm not afraid,"" okay Oscar the Grouch, chill on the couch (Fuck)
You got an Oscar, damn
Can anyone else get some food in their mouth? (For real)
They made a movie about you, you're in everybody's top ten
You're not getting better with time
It's fine, Eminem, put down the pen
Or write an apology
Over the simple fact, you had to diss to acknowledge me
I am the prodigy
How could I even look up to you? You ain't as tall as me
5'8"" and I'm 6'4"", seven punches hold your head still
Last time you saw 8 Mile was at home on a treadmill
You were named after a candy
I was named after a gangster (Brr)
And don't be a sucker and take my verse off of Yelawolf's album, thank you (Thank you)
I just wanna feed my daughter
You tryna stop the money to support her
You the one always talkin' 'bout the action
Text me the addy, I'm pullin' up scrappin'
And I'm by my fuckin' self, what's happenin'
EST captain, salute me or shoot me
That's what he's gonna have to do to me
When he realizes there ain't shit he could do to me
Everybody always hated me, this isn't anything new to me
Yeah there's a difference between us
I got all of my shit without Dre producin' me (Ayy)
I know you're not used to me
Usually one of your disses should ruin me
But bitch I'm from Cleveland
Everybody quiet this evenin', I'm readin' the eulogy (Shh)
Dropped an album called Kamikaze
So that means he killed him
Already fucked one rapper's girl this week
Don't make me call Kim

[Chorus]
I'm sick of them sweatsuits and them corny hats, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
I'm sick of you bein' rich and you still mad, let's talk about it (Let's talk)
Both of us single dads from the Midwest, we can talk about it (Haha)

You hated what he said, right?
Beat his ass, leave him at the stoplight
I know you wanted change, but nobody's around
So, kick him again while he's on the ground, yo

Tried to lay me down and so I dodged and ran away
Put a gun up to my face, so I'll fucking catch a case (A case)

I prayed to God and then I went to sleep with bloody hands
Inside my room, I heard the sirens from the ambulance
I chipped my tooth and then I found a piece inside my pants
He talkin' shit, when he wake up, I go do that again
I came back
I wanna know if I tell you a secret, will you keep it?
If a pussy wanna say shit, then I'll fuckin' stomp his face in
Nah, not getting better, can't change it, I left blood all on the pavement
I'm on borrowed time, can't shake it, uh, blackout when I'm ragin', uh
Me and all these pills be on a fuckin' first name basis, uh
There's an invisible voice that is talkin' to me and it's always tellin' me to kill
I got a problem with separating what my head is creating from things that are real
I'm in a room, hyperventilating and debating to pop off the cap of these pills
If I get angry, I'm goin' to start up a riot like people on Capitol Hill

Turn my vocals up, alright

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wrote this song as a message for help
On behalf of anybody findin' their-self
I wrote this letter to numb your pain
'Cause everyday I wake up, I'm feelin' the same
I got issues just like you got issues
I've been hurt, I seen the scar tissue
If I showed you, would you run away?
Do I gotta hide 'em for you to wanna stay?
Do I, even need you? Should I leave you?
Do I, gotta be you, just to please you?
Do I, say I'm all good, when I bleed you
Through my heart? Quit tearin' mine apart

[Chorus: Hailee Steinfeld]
I shout, I swear, I get angry, I get scared
I fall, I break, I mess up, I make mistakes
But if you can't take me at my worst
You don't deserve me at my best

Gotta keep it goin', gotta keep my head up, uh

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Life is about makin' mistakes
It's also about trying to be great
Do not let failure scare you away
I know you fed up, you fall, get up
It's all in us, I can speak about it 'cause I did it (true)
Ladies and gentlemen, here's the exhibit
It's my life, look a little closer, you can see the highlight
Gold ain't always golden but I told 'em
Look at all the years I've been waitin' for a moment
Shed a lot of tears just to smile in the mornin'
Tell me could you love me? Tell me could you love me?
Tell me could you love me if I told you...

I ain't even gon' say shit
And half of what is left goes to her

Till I (skkrrrrrrttt) out in my Subaru and in the rear view is them lights
I'm talking about red white and blue
The same color as our flag

But the ones that's whoopin my ass
And the same days that I’m happy
Is the same days that I’m mad
Cuz I can't go 24 hours without shit happening to my ass, get high

Burned so many bridges, got nowhere to go
Bitches got these motives like Anna Nicole
I'm smoking cigarettes alone until it burn a hole

I always hated to smile, but it keep what is killing me hidden inside
I didn't sign up to be the hero, but I don't want to wind up a villain
I put my daughter to bed, then attempted to kill myself in the kitchen
Yeah, I should've screamed, but nobody listened
So I passed out with the blood drippin'
In this glass house, feeling like a prison
Me and death keep tongue-kissin'
I just fell out with my lil' bro, the life getting to us
The drink getting to us, the drugs getting to us
This highway to hell and everybody knew it

It's Cleveland man

[Verse 1]
I am the alpha omega, black flag swinger
Fuck a driveway I’m in airplane hangers
Me and my gang poppin' champagne like players
For all of them days with no lights and no cable
No one can save you, my city’s fatal
Make it up out of it how can they hate you?
C-L-E-V-E-L-A-N-D’s the greatEST
I'll light this bitch up make it look like its Vegas
We on, mufucka we on
The first one to blow since Bone
Thinking back when I had a back pack full of fat raps
Didn’t no one wanna hear my song
Mufucka y’all wrong, mufucka y’all wrong
Made it and I never left home
Where I’m from enemies bust off their shells like King Koopa
Roll through these streets come up gone like Bermuda
I’m just a boy in the hood like I’m Cuba
So soon as I moved out I bought me a Ruger
You come to my house you blow loud as a tuba
I bring your bitch here, she'll go down like a scuba
All of y’all shits out of style like a scooter
Put all of y’all shits in the ditch like a sewer 
Make all of y’all bow like my name is Anubis
Talk out your medulla get hit with bazookas
[Hook]
(Bitch!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(What?)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ahh!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

[Verse 2]
If you ain’t living your life then you’re dead
And sleep is its cousin so I shot my bed
Paranoia got me using these meds
Now I'm Smokey as Chris on a Friday like Craig
Retract that statement, I'm stoney as Fred
Evacuate when my homies get mad
You better pray to your God for a blessing
Before they make your world look like Armageddon
Knew I was trouble since I was 11
Ripped up my jeans and I bought me a leather
My friends saw me as a King like Coretta
My dad saw his son as a nuisance, a rebel, and (ahh!)
My music sounds like the devil
Turn that shit off or get out of my temple
Right after that he’d go back to his Kettle One vodka
And drink it all up till he's mental
I have no issue, I am official
Let them come at me I practice Jiu Jitsu
Only fear two things with three letters dawg
That's G-O-D, God and my fucking initials
Doctors called up to the news to report to them what they discovered
Said I’m the first of a species that they call a real muthafucka, (Kells)
And I’m sorry if you get a lot of hits from all my followers
If you acknowledge us in any other way then positive
But you shouldn’t be hollering or talking about Superman
When you're living in Metropolis
And if you follow astronomy I’m a Taurus
That means I don’t give a fuck what you thought of me
I walk into an interview looking like a lobotomy
Flipping my middle finger at everybody who watching us, (uh)
Fuck that bring the beat back
Kill this instrumental leave the body where the reef at
Nah, fuck that where the keef at
Sprinkle a little bit on a quarter of my weed sack
Give me a minute I took a hit I'm tryna focus like astigmatism
My competition on my dick, they're like the zip on my denim
They want the heat I light em up like I put cigarettes in 'em
You bitch, whats your religion?
I wanna know what God you’re seeing in a couple of seconds
I wanna see the criticism bout my lyricism
When I’m in your face rippin' this rhythm up like canabalism
Its Kells
[Hook]
(Bitch!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(What?)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ahh!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega
(Ay!)
I am the alpha, I am the omega

[Outro]
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
I am the alpha omega, the fuck is you saying?
EST run shit you better quit playing
They start a war if you mention my name
I’m the alpha omega

Girl I know
I know you bought me the watch
You ain't get it back though
My name's on the back though
I flipped the lock to the back door
And took the key under the mat though
I know you hate that
But you did some things that you cannot take back
I needed change
Left a nickel for a dime
That is a payback
""What you sayin?""
Bitch I'm over you and I ain't playing
Should've been a one night stand
But here we go again....

[Chorus]
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared
I wish that I loved you
Or that I cared
Or that I'd even give a damn if you were here
But you're gone so it's fuck you
I'm a player
I am everything that you wanted but you're scared
[Verse 2]
Please never call me
Do not mention me in any stories
Do not show up at the homie's party
Come up to me and then say I'm sorry
You're just a
You just a — hold up let me stop
The Henny shots got the petty talk comin I don't wanna have them thoughts running
Can't believe that I bust in a thot's stomach
Fuck is wrong with you
I don't even get along with you
(Not even a little bit) 
But the head was phenomenal, 
Used to do that in the car with you
(True)
Used to travel around the world just for the rendezvous
(Come through) 
Now I gotta get high just to deal with you these are the chronicles

No mercy has begun
Ladies and gentlemen
Machine Gun Kelly
This kid, I think he is a star
He's one of the best live performers I've ever seen
He's also more importantly a movement

[Verse 1]
Backpack? Fuck that
I was always hanging where the thugs at
I was always hanging with the rugrats
Someone come and show me where the drugs at
Someone come and pop on a hot song, meaning my shit, get an iPhone take a video and make it last long get some popcorn because I murder every single instrumental that I get on
And a muthafucka isn't gonna stop the shit
Until I make an album like a 2pacalypse
Until I'm killing everybody like in Auschwitz
Until I'm revolutionary like a Gandhi is
Until I'm poppin' all these bottles to accomplishments
Until I'm always hot no matter what the climate is
Until whenever somebody is feeling talkative my name is brought up, doesn't matter what the topic is
Didn't think I rap? Bitch I flow like ""boom boom bap""
Bitch I come from where you never moved at
Look into my room get a view, look at my past
God damn
Got weed, got jack, oxy's? Had that
Got Jimi, got Slash, got shrooms, got hash
Bipolar syndrome, kicked in, got mad
Walked on the red carpet like kiss my ass you bitch
(More Sound Clips of Various People talking about MGK)
He was truly the only developed on-point performer on the bill
If you know anything about lyricists, then you know who MGK is
I need a freestyle, I need to hear Machine Gun Kelly spit

[Verse 2]
Fuck that, y'all don't gotta hear shit
Ask anybody in the 216 if my name rings bells in them bricks
""Man everybody know who that is""
What you hate, boy? You late, boy
You ain't heard about that great boy?
3 letter name cacausian boy
Used to live right there up the way, boy
You heard about him, you've said the name
You saw the iTunes and clicked to play
You liked the shit and you bought the shit
Put him on the playlist right next to Jay
Then your girl saw me, I signed her tits
And she disappeared you couldn't find the bitch
Then your heart stopped you know what time it is
I put my dick in her common sense
Fuck boy you lonely
Fuck boy you phony
You would think these fuck boys fucking boys with the way that they be all on me
If it ain't EST in your mouth...then whatever you rep is corny
Got a new single without me on it? That shit's boring, bitch I'm snoring
Man I'm touring every damn day
I showed y'all how to turn up
100 j's in my ashtray bitch I showed y'all how to burn up
I sacrificed what y'all wouldn't give to these kids and now you love fans?
None of these rappers got a movement tell 'em quit jocking my ass
God damn...
And y'all can have the bloggers I don't type shit
God gave me both these hands to fight with
Wassup!?
Now say goodnight quick because my right fist's like Vicodin
Might just throw you on the ground like dices
Might just go into the pocket with your license, get a wallet and a couple dollars, buy nice shit
Dyke bitches all over my dick, that's priceless
I just fuck 'em if they're wet like Pisces
Wives is jealous of the bitch I'm with cause they almost F'd like D-...get it?
Digest every little word I'm spittin' cause it's food for thought so pay attention
Better listen, I’m on a mission to killing off all of my competition and if you are with that then good riddance muthafucka!
(Outro Talking - More Various Interview Sound Clips)
Now Machine Gun Kelly seems like somebody you would diss, lyrically I wouldn't think you'd like Machine Gun Kelly
What are you trying to say, he's wack or something?
He is wack
He's not wack
He's better than 80% of the rappers out there
It must be nice being MGK right now
The rapper recently released what he says to be the true meaning of his Lace Up movement

You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Damn
I saw you walk in the room and I tried my best
Not to panic while I'm lookin' for the back door
I smelled the perfume and it's obvious
I'm gonna stay and put my key in the bag more
I can't, I can't, I can't pretend to forget
You're the reason I punched a hole in the wall back home
And then, and then, and then a couple hours later
We're in room 29 at The Chateau

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I left before you woke up
I don't feel right (Seeing you sober)

Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby

I'm keepin' you waiting
But I won't wait on you
Want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
[Verse 2: Halsey]
I've wasted so much time
Waitin' around for your phone calls every night
My bad dreams are silk-screened
'Cause I taste blood when you bleed
It's eating me alive
We'd both be better off alone
Still think I'd get you on the phone
With one last breath in me
I'd die before I let you leave

You left before I woke up
Why don't I ever see you sober?

Face you

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Am I loud and clear?
Or do I gotta scream like I did every day when I was a troubled teen, huh?
Do you want to know my past and see every single scar and know what they mean, huh?
17 running up in Mickey D's begging for a double cheese, huh
Singing ""I don't want to grow up don’t nobody like you when your 23""
I came from nothing but a fucking unsupportive father I don't ever see
I had to watch a crooked jury put my brother in the penitentiary,
I never fit in
Criticism, made me the man I couldn't be
I'm reminiscing on when life was different spending every day at Chuckee Cheese, uh

[Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
We live on front porches  and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I’ll slave till the end
And I’ll run these streets if you give me a chance

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I've been here so long
Maybe I should runaway
Try to find a summer day
What is love
Love is pain
Love is butterflies and stomach aches
Love is looking out a windowpane, tears dripping looking like you’re in the rain
For someone you don't even know but for somebody you may never see again
I am only alive once
And I'ma die when God wants
So fill the sky with diamonds
Because that's how it's gonna look when I'm gone
Had a vision as a kid that one day I would change the world with my song
Several years have passed and now that vision came to life that boy's a fucking icon
[Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
We live on front porches  and swing life away
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor I’ll slave till the end
And I’ll run these streets if you give me a chance

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
Sometimes I don't want to fucking wake up
When all they want to do is bring me down
And all the things I’ve went through as I came up
Are the fucking reasons why I run this town

[Hook: Kellin Quinn & Machine Gun Kelly]
We live on front porches and swing life away (and to my fans, I told you)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage
If love is a labor, I'll slave 'til the end
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance
We live on front porches and swing life away (all my dreamers)
We get by just fine here on minimum wage (stay real)
If love is a labor, I'll slave 'til the end (and to my love)
And I'll run these streets if you give me a chance (stay here)

Voices in the air
I hear them loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just wanna listen

[Verse 1: MGK]
As my, world turns
The heart beats
Not only in my chest
But the heart in these streets
So when they feel this, they feel me
But I can't feel nothin', outside these Dre beats
I am from the city of evil, came from the bottom
Standing on top of what was supposed to be my coffin, whats up?
Inception shows me as a dead man walkin', but reflections shows this kid's still got it
Let it be known I got the throne like I don't know that there's a king
Never grew up around a family because I'm not a human being
And anyone under my level that’s coming at my spot for the top
Let them have it, cause when I leave, the whole world drops
Lace up Kells

[Chorus]
I hear voices in the air
I hear em’ loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear
Nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh I am
[Verse 2]
Waking up sweatin from the stress of being caged down
Everything I write is played out like what is this?
Tear the whole page out
Man I come from holes in the wall but they don’t know the path
Even if I told them it all, they wouldn't know the half
So maybe I fill up my luggage with all of these dreams and put on my black coat and my black chucks and nothing in my jeans
And just run, till the day comes like Rocky’s movie scene
And I’m on top of the world, look up and scream like this is me, this is Kells
Crucified by the public without the nails
Do or die in my city but clearly I never failed
Lost myself in the game when I found myself in a cell
Then I found myself in the fame when I lost myself in the pills
And you cannot mess with me still , seen them boys and they winnin
Underdogs of the year, Cleveland boys in the buildin'
What the fuck is a ceiling I’m taking this to the top, and when I leave the whole world drops Lace Up Kells

[Chorus]
I hear voices in the air
I hear em’ loud and clear
Telling me to listen
Whispers in my ear nothing can compare
I just want to listen
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible
Telling me I am Invincible - oh oh I am…..40Embed"

I'm writing you this message just so I can say that I love you
I had to let you know that everything about me was you, yeah
I think it's time for me to leave, but I'll never leave you
I just looked at your pictures, so the last thing I did was see you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm twenty-nine, my anxiety's eating me alive
I'm fightin' with myself and my sobriety every night
And last time I couldn't barely open up my eyes, I apologize

[Chorus]
I'm not gonna lie and tell you it's alright, it's alright
You're gonna cry and baby, that's alright, it's alright
I wrote you this song to keep when I'm gone
If you ever feel alone
You're gonna cry and baby, that's alright, it's alright

[Verse 2]
I hope you get to go to all the places that I showed you
When I was on the road and couldn't be home to hold you
Part of me doesn't want this cruel world to know you
So just try and keep in mind everything that I told you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm twenty-nine, and society's eating me alive
I'm fighting what comes with this notoriety every night
This is the last time I'll ever open up my eyes, I apologize
[Chorus]
I'm not gonna lie and tell you it's alright, it's alright
You're gonna cry and baby, that's alright, it's alright

Tell all my competition that I love 'em
But I brought 'em back just to kill 'em again
Tell all the listeners that I said, ""Fuck 'em""
If they thought I'd never be breathing again
I keep some drink in the cup
In case anyone got some more beef, I can eat 'em again
I made a promise to beat their ass up
Like Adonis if I ever meet 'em again

Fuck your big bro, uh
We the ones that got it when the rent's low

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I got a combination to a safe in the back of the bank
That be storing my shit

Now she out here whoring and shit
I got a reputation to be going and showing up

I had an altercation down in Florida
I threw his face on the floor of the shit

Fuck a bitch, though, huh
Y'all ain't want us before we was rich, ho

Stop the debate if my name isn't mentioned
In this generation as one of the greatest
From lyrics to cadence
I changed the way rappers rock out on them stages
I saw people take it, and they were more famous
So I ain't get credit, I had to be patient
I know people hate me just by my appearance
You motherfuckers can't be serious, ayy

Am I wrong for being lost?
The pressures of being boss exhausted every bone in my body
I can't walk
I don’t talk, I scream, I don't stop to think
I'm so close to the dream that I can’t go to sleep
Ironic, I know, so I need more chronic to roll
Tryna find what's more important, the money or my soul
It's cold, I'm low, I'm caught between the roads
Under the Hollywood sign, you get blinded by the glow, uh
Yo, how could you look me in the face?
You sat at the table with my daughter promising you got us
Right after you finished saying grace
Why don't you tell her what you're hiding in the bank?
It's time to cut my lawn to see the snakes
It’s time to tell the truth to every fan who doesn’t understand
That it's because of you they had to wait
While you left me here to deal with all the hate
I still smile, but feel so fake
It’s no sun, the clouds are opaque
So much shade I read on one page
I can't even look at your name without getting the shakes
What a mistake, uh, look how you take, uh
What doesn't belong to you, this was a rape
And if fate send us both to Heaven
I'ma keep a blade in my leather so I can kill you at the gate, uh
[Chorus]
(First place)
Is it worth it when you see it’s all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)
Commit third-degree murder (What for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore

Is it worth it when you see it's all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)
Commit third-degree murder (What for?)
Tryna play me like a Hollywood whore

[Verse 2]
I woke up sweatin', tryna forget I'm in a mansion
'Cause fans are mad at my expansion
And my friend I thought was family
Who'd always understand me
Got offended 'cause he jealous
We supposed to be at the GRAMMYs
I'm asking, when did pride and passion
Get mistaken for handouts and ass-kissing?
The fact is I made it from trailer trash to Saks 5th
Took it from underground to massive, and the come up was classic
Back when white boys rapped, they gettin' their ass kicked
I was battlin', putting these rappers in caskets
I was walking home, getting jumped after classes
Tell me why don't my haters mention that shit?
Now my rent is due and I'm a tenant getting by with no credit
Got residue from a sedative I ain't get from the medic
My schedule is so fuckin' hectic, but still I'm in debt
I'd be better off dead so life insurance keep my family fed
It's because of y'all, I couldn't separate from my career
Because of y'all, I hated myself for so many years
Because of you, you ain't never gonna see me trust
Even if I got a wife, she just somebody I fuck
[Chorus]

Is it worth it when you see it's all (Two-faced)?
Trying to fit into a world with no (New space)

Fuck

[Refrain]
I just spent too many minutes watchin' little videos of shitty wannabe rappers dissing me
I just spent the winter livin' after someone tried to send a kill shot, missin' me
Young blonde Don and the double-X mob got a gang out in Sicily
Why you think they call me the Gunner?
I'm poppin' off on anybody if they trigger me

[Verse 1]
Black and yellow jacket on like I'm Kill Bill
Grew up scrappin' and I still will
We can take it back to 2012
I was trappin' on the tour bus with Meek Mill
Take it back to Cleveland, when they gave Chase 17 years, no plea deal
2014 when the people tried to rob me in the lobby
I bet they can feel the feet still
Point out my enemies soon as they mention me
Call an assembly, pick up a pen and put you out your misery
Written in history, it was gonna happen eventually
I just can't wait 'til the day that I run into you physically
For everything that I went through mentally
When it felt like everybody in the world was against me
When all the critics and every article tried to offend me
My daughter slapped a kid for talkin' 'bout me in elementary
We ain't playin', it's deeper than the fame
People gettin' checked for disrespectin' the family name
Two chopsticks, no lo mein
Hollow tips, got no name
Bust them shits with no aim
Like it's Bird Box
But the blindfold is a black flag this time to cover my face
The dash cam just saw me killin' everybody
[Chorus]
I got off on floor 13, no in between
I roll my weed with fronto leaf
I chop my coke on hotel keys
I chopped his face like Constantine
Constantly get déjà vu
I see me when I look at you
I never die, I multiply
So don't cry at my funeral

What would this generation of hip-hop be
Without me here to piss y'all off?
I see the blogs, I read the comments
I'm confused, I need to pause
Look at y'all waitin' on me to fall off
While I'm lookin' at y'all from a suite in the Waldorf
I sold 40 million records, I ain't even 30
Give me 20 seconds, I'll list 10 movies that I've been in
One legend that tried to fuck with me and then got the venom
One publication that said that I would never be in it
One agent that told me without her, my career is finished
And I couldn't give a single fuck inside my cerebellum
Y'all award shows suck, go tell 'em
We ain't suckin' no dick in the 216
Brought O's to the land like Beckham
On the 13th floor with a weapon
I heard that they coming, yeah, let 'em in
I got somethin' for 'em, yeah, please forgive my sins
Blood on my Ralph Lauren, yeah, I can't wash this shit
Wake up, say, ""Good morning,"" yeah, like I forgot

Smoke as if there's not already 27 roaches in the ashtray
Smile as if no one hated at all
As if anyone understood anytime I evolved

Buy a Bentley and look just like you?
How am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous
And all the pain is created?
I need to overdose on inspiration

That it's okay to let the pain show

I'm a demon in the night, she's an angel with the white
Told me, ""Keep on all the lights, I'ma show you what you like""
Help you put back on your clothes, make sure nothing's on your nose
Ain't even tell my closest homies, nobody knows

I hate that I saw you again last night
You were with somebody and so was I
Met you in the bathroom at 12:05
And I fucked you again, we can never be friends, yeah, yeah, yeah

I couldn't cry (Couldn't cry)
I need to smoke, I'm feelin' sick inside (Sick inside)

Both tellin' lies, our alibis didn't work this time (Didn't work this time)

Ay
Complicated
Frustrated
Underestimated
Can't sleep, mind racing
Hard to stay concentrated
Foreign towns, missing home
Please don't forget about me
Tell the story, all the glory
Fuck what they say about me
Some days I feel
So out of place with all these fake people in my face
I cannot relate, yeah
Sometimes I feel
Like I create, and they just take everything  I make
Turn around and then hate
Maybe I was living off expectations
Or I was born in the wrong generation?
(That's probably it)
Meanwhile I'm crushing weed overseas
Hopefully tonight we'll find more
Long days on tour
Backstage getting boring
But step on stage and they roaring
[Bridge]
I fell in love with a very bad habit
But I feel alive for the very first time

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna die
But I don't, I don't wanna hide
Or keep shit inside
I will not cry, so
I deal how I deal with it, deal with it
I am 13 hours clean and still counting
Save me from these day dreams about it
Under full moons, night swims, and tattoos
I cannot stand these fucking rules
I been sailing too long in cold water
Restrain me from these pills and more doctors
And erase me from this page and start over
I wanna start over

[Bridge]
See
I fell in love with a very bad habit
I was alive for the very first time

[Verse 3]
You said goodbye when I was trying to say
”Something ain't right inside of me”
I wanna run away
(I want to run away, run away)
I don't wanna stay
(I don't wanna stay, I don't wanna stay here)
I wish you could relate
I'd wish upon a star- fuck that, leave it up to fate
We are who we are so don't judge me
Just 'cause it's hard to smile
Read between thin white lines
See what's in my mind
[Outro]
I fell in love with a very bad habit
But I was alive for the very first time

Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn

[Verse 1]
Kells,
All these pretty lights, 
Can’t you see em?
Endless nights
In my life's museum
Where we see our heroes
And pretend to be em
And we seize the day
Carpe Diem
Previous to this dream state I had leftovers on each plate
Left shoe all tattered up from this long journey my feet ache
Left the life that I lived because everyday was just replays,
And I dreamed big, walked around in my PJ's
And my street days are still here
Never changed like I still wear
The same pair
Phone call? what for?
We ain't long distance, I’m still there
Still on the blocks where gun cocks and gunshots are more familiar of a sound then what’s ""hot""
12 dollar showers at truck stops would give anybody motivation that you must not lose this one shot...

[Verse 2]
Demon days
Evil nights
Happy hours
Frequent flights,
God flow
People’s strife
Hear it once
Speak it twice
Hearts never break even
And they change color like seasons
Backs turn like treason
But somehow you swear you ain't leaving
Follow me now, follow me now
Spoon fulls of sugar and handfuls of medicine help it go down
Help it go down
I was just a fool in a room full of Edison's, look at me now
Look at me now
Feel my words
Look at this sound
Reminiscin on when I was lookin out on the city wishin a million muthafuckas gave me that crown, bitch I run this town

Still remember smokin' just to calm my nerves

[Verse 1]
Danger, one of us just lost our savior
Gotta maintain when you're going insane, so I say this prayer
Dear God, why do I need this medicine to control my anger?
And do you even exist? They're trying to say it's a myth
Lotta things left unsaid, lotta things left unanswered
My aunt just passed from cancer
Dad just got out of rehab
And mom's never gonna show up, gotta grow up
Ride with me through the memories inside of me
'Til the nights I was hooked on the ivory
Head hurting all week 'cause of bad coke
Then the same week Peep overdosed, that's fucked up
But I guess I lucked up
And I feel his pain because it probably won't be until
The day I die that they love us
But trust, every nomination I don't get
Every list that I ain't on
Is a reminder of why I wrote songs in the first place
As a way to escape where I came from

[Chorus]
This just my pretty toxic
Heavy conscience weighing on my soul
Six shots in my revolver
When I'm on my own
[Verse 2]
Play this song
On the first day I am gone, I do not want you to cry
Legends never die, I hope our story's told
And the year spent on that road
Before they came to our shows
We were creating our lane, I hope they pave it in gold
Take me home, somewhere I belong
Somewhere foreign, looks like Dali's drawing
Yeah, isn't it funny that whenever you got a vision
A mission and a couple of plans to go with it
Somebody gotta come along mad and damage it
Like a cancer that inhabits never banishes
I managed to smoke five grams of cannabis
And still keep my stamina for the fans and the goddamn cameras
That attack my stance like evangelists
I said truth and they couldn't handle it
So when it sinks you stand in it
I guess this is my Titanic
With no James Cameron to direct this draft of it
Just my

[Chorus]
Pretty toxic heavy conscience
Weighing on my soul
Six shots in my revolver
When I'm on my own

I'm just out here chasing my dreams, girl
But it's crazy cause that dream cost me my Dream Girl
Promised you I wouldn't change before I left
Now I think leaving is the one thing I regret
Cause the one thing I possess
It wasn't materials, wasn't checks, wasn't cars, wasn't clothes, or any part of success
It was you, and without that in my life I'm depressed
You became the new drug I couldn't get
And every time you came over I was on some shit
Either too fucked up, or bitching about how you dress
Even though I remember when you would lay with me when I ain't have a bed
Buy me food and come wake me up with some head
Girl, you had me like a dread - locked down, but I wouldn't show it
Instead got on that bus and left you blowing in the wind
Shit, and it's fucked up cause every girl I'm with I see your face
Now summers here and I'm sitting outside your place singing this shit

Took me a couple years to say I loved you, but I meant it when I said it
Wasn't much of a romantic, but you get it
Didn't really smoke, but when I rolled it up, you hit it
And we lit it up - shotgunning our kisses
And fuck these other bitches, baby, fuck these other bitches in my bunk
Staring up at all your pictures that you sent me on my birthday
Remember that? Cause I couldn't forget it
Like I forgot yours, but I'm sorry and I said it
I admit it, I fucked up and I lied, but this is true
I don't know what home is because I'm lost without you
Just like our favorite song, yeah blink 182
Now I just turn it off when it comes on, I wish I hated you
I used to have someone at 3am that I could call
Now it just rings and I don't get nothing at all
Where you at girl?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Every day I, wake up, to the same shit
In the same house, with the same bricks
In the same clothes, with the same kicks
I might as well be in jail
Caged in, stairin' at the wall waitin' for a change but
Dad telling me I gotta get a job
Couldn't pay the bills so the lights turned dark
Them Cleveland boys got it hard
Oh my god, we been living like this too long
Just to lose it all in a week
My people too strong
Get it? Me and my boys be blowin'
Puffing on weed like this the lawn
Me and my boys tired of being here
That is why we gone
They say we wouldn't amount to nothing, huh?
Y'all thought we was bluffing, huh?
Fought every temptation shit, I guess I'm David Ruffin huh?
Nowadays, we don't gotta do that dirt, tell my boys they good
And nowadays my little girl won't have to work, moved her out the hood
Look man, I done been through it all, and I'ma damned if I got this far
And if I let them strip me of this message let these haters take my heart
This for the ones that had it hard, the ones like me, the underdogs
This for the ones that waited for them clouds to form, please god let it
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
Oh, oh, you can't see my tears, in the rain
Underneath it all, we're just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
All around the world it's just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
No, so, I let it rain

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Oh, and they mad that I made it out the city (What?)
But if you look I'm still out in the city (Oh)
Before everything I had clout in the city (Yeah)
Toured the states and never bounced on the city (No)
Shout out to everybody that's proud in the city (Hey)
Everybody cheering in the crowd from the city (Hey)
Everyone that never had doubts in the city
Cause they know I represent what we about in the city (Woo)
And I'm still laced up, tell the world that’s nothing changed
Till it's hundred dollar bills in my pocket, then nothings change
If my team ain't with me, then I don't wanna thang, tell them I'll go broke before I run out on my gang
EST over everything
100 thousand plus, cult fan base yea that is us, my songs tattooed on they body troubled youth, we bad as fuck and what?
Nobody gave a shit about for broken mirrors
So I care less about appearance
Just as long as they can hear us
We're fearless, we're stupid, we're dealers, we're losers
We're killers, we're orphan's, we're addicts, we're stealers
We're shooters so kill us
We are what they say we are until conformity hits us
Or those clouds come down and take them all with us, please god let it
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
You can't see my tears, in the rain
Underneath it all, we're just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
All around the world it's just the same, same, same
You can't see my tears, in the rain
So I let it rain

Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the morning
Wide awake still, not even yawning
Not even sure why I'm up at dawn like I'm celebrating
When my agent told me that no one's calling
It's a ounce in my living room on the couch
Next to a couple homies that smoked it and passed out
So I'm alone with my thoughts in this glass house
In the cabinet are glass vials, I just poured all the last out
I smelled her, now she's on my mind
I met her the first time my light turned lime
Hate it when she's gone, but she ain't hard to find
Left her on my desk, she made designs in little lines

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's 5:3666
It's 5:3666

[Chorus: phem]
Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ayy, look, I'm writing this at 5:3666 in the evening
In my head, talking to these demons (Demons)
In my bed, staring at these ceilings
I just bleached my hair and changed my whole appearance
I'm just fed up with these smoke and mirrors
My uncle sold some pictures of me with no clearance
What the fuck is family? I can't take that serious
Thank God everybody sucks so I can write these lyrics
Go pick her up, I need to lift my spirits
They don't know that we hook up, I don't let cameras near us
There's some shit I do, when she's around, I shouldn't share
Like that week I spent locked in a room with her in Paris (Fuck)

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's 5:3666 (Yeah)
It's 5:3666

[Chorus: phem & Machine Gun Kelly]
Some days, I feel like I let myself down
I love my life, gonna run it in the ground
Can't sleep for days, got your name in my brain (Name in my brain)
Can't sleep for days, gotta stay up, stay up forever

[Outro: Machine Gun Kelly]
It's 5:3666 (Yeah)
It's 5:3666 (Man)

Hated the most, so I keep my haters close
Let 'em know I want the smoke
So much bread I gotta boast
This burner turn you into toast
I'm so G, I don’t keep that pistol on me
Ay, I'll beat yo ass you try to press that issue on me
Ay, I keep a stash under all these zippers on me
I got bitches blowin' like I got a whistle on me

Ay, can’t stop getting paper
Ay, can’t stop rollin papers

Tatted on my choker
Shoppin' sprees at Dover
I ain’t stopping shit till I’m 70 years older
Slap me if I’m sober
Yea, yea, yea, come over
Fucked two girls that looked like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler

Back shot, back shot, back shot, back shot, right behind the backdrop
Can’t stop, can’t stop, can’t stop, can’t stop turnin' up like mascots

I hope you got a plan, catch me if you can hoe

Yea hoe, can’t get jammed hoe, I’ll be damned hoe
Yea hoe, I’m the man hoe, from the Land hoe
Yea hoe, out them bandos, to these bands hoe
Sandals for my fam though - 3, 2, 1, takeoff
Jets round the world with them
And you know we gotta fly with the herb with them
In the town, I’m a chief like turbo and them
Shouts for the flow G Herbo and them
I just got the cell phone workin' again
I just got the styrofoam purple again
Never make threats non-verbal again
You already know how I'm lurkin' again

Tattoo'd back, man see the rap name
Take a bath in the champagne, wild motherfucker
Straight from the block, dawg, ducking shots walking to the store
Dollar for a Black & Mild, motherfucker
Blew up as a rockstar so I'm top floor
Throwing drinks on a cop car, foul motherfucker
The only number calling up my phone
Is from my dealer, swear that dude won't leave me alone
Cause he know when I pick up, I'ma cop a couple zones
And my girl know I ain't fuckin' 'til she roll me up a cone
I be keeping freaks in the home, yeah

Got a condom and a hundred dollar bill (uh)
I can snort a rock or I can spend it on a pill (uh)
I be with some models that just flew in from Brazil
And they give me pussy 365 days a year (bitch)
I'm the type to never go to sleep
I'm the type to break a couple motherfuckers' teeth
I'm the type to drop a hit of acid on the beach
And fly to Baltimore and scream, ""Fuck the police!""
Do not get it twisted, this is not an image
There are legends told about the nights I'm in the buildings
It is not a question whether or not I'm the trillest
Every bitch is pressing me to get some cum on their acrylics
1.5 million for my record deal and now I got the feeling
I could finally give a fuck about my parents' marriage healing (fuck 'em)
I'ma buy some mirrors just to put them on the ceiling
So when I wake up I see the realest motherfucker breathing

I got death in my pocket and nothing but time
All these bones in the closet, in the back of my mind
I just leave 'em there, I don’t even care, no
Holding up a flare, I could use a prayer, oh
I got death in my pocket, but I feel so alive

[Interlude: Machine Gun Kelly]
Don't know why, but it feels like my world is crashing down
I just bought a brand...
Fuck, how much darkness does it take to get this flashy?

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Don't know why, but it feels like my world is crashing down
I just bought a brand new car, I wanna crash it now
How much darkness did it take to get this flashy now?
I lose a piece of my soul when the camera flashes
So I’m just asking every fan who's questioning my passion
Thinking I'm caught up in fashion or that I forgot my past
To understand that I'm just a dropout, I don't have the answers
I became a dad so young, I ain't know how to use them Pampers
Baby mama's food stamps kept my stomach full
I had to make a plan 'cause now my family needed me to make it rapping
Me and Slim back at that address, 128th, we trapping
Writing lyrics down on napkins
Room so small, we shared a mattress
Look what happened
[Chorus: Naomi Wild & Machine Gun Kelly]
I got death in my pocket and nothing but time
All these bones in the closet, in the back of my mind
I just leave ’em there, I don’t even care, no
Holding up a flare, I could use a prayer, oh
I got death in my pocket, but I feel so alive

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Don't know how I get so high, but I’m not passing out
I guess the drugs are  in my blood, hope I don't pass it down
Hope I'm alive to see my baby get her cap and gown
'Cause doctors told my dad he won’t be here a year from now
Yeah, my first reaction was to punching the wall until it's cracking
Both my knuckles shattered, don't ask what the fuck's the matter
I've been battling the fact I lost my closest to cancer
The only thing she asked was for me and him to get closer
But I hung up too fast, went to sleep in and then she passed
You've been silent seven years, it took that to get us back
We all needed second chances, I've been bottling the sadness
I guess I'm just happy that we finally got to bury shit before the casket

[Chorus: Naomi Wild & Machine Gun Kelly]
I got death in my pocket and nothing but time
All these bones in the closet, in the back of my mind
I just leave 'em there, I don't even care, no
Holding up a flare, I could use a prayer, oh
I got death in my pocket, but I feel so alive
[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
I think I'm ready to die tonight
It's fucked up 'cause I ain't lived half my life
I saw the devil and passed him like
""You tryna fuck up my afterlife""

I've made up my mind, don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right, don't need to look no further
This ain't lust, I know this is love but
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up?
Or should I just (ugh) keep on (yeah) chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements
Should I just keep on chasing pavements

“You know, it’s crazy, man
I never thought music could have got us this far
Y'all have no idea how many sleepless or hungry nights we spent
On the fucking floor and couches just trying to get to this point
But no matter how hard the road gets, you gotta stay the course man
Keep chasing these pavements ‘til you can’t run anymore
Lace Up!""

[Verse 1]
Uh, fall asleep until the dream comes
Muthafuck reality
Happiness, I think I need some
So I overdose on fantasy
My life's equation ain't complicated
Just a combination of hate is denominated as stated
No rest plus the sess and abusive prescription meds
Times stress equals out to be the muthafucking mess that is, Kells
The boy with no home
That's why I live in your speakers through this song
That's why they turn it up so loud the bass hits
And you can feel me when I'm gone
And when I die, spread my message like the Qu'ran
Muthafuckas getting paid, I'm just tryna get saved
7 years of living crooked, I'm just tryna get straight
All this crack in my city even though these street's paved
Makes me wonder if I should let all my life's dreams wait
Or should I -

Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?
(Or should I) Just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?

[Verse 2]
Bored out of my mind, I need a fucking job
But they ain't hiring shit, that's why I fucking rob (Gimmie that)
Had to hustle cause unless you got them test scores
Colleges only come around here looking for Brett Favre
For the next star, or if you 6'4""
And if you can pitch, but other than that shit you just pitch raw
That's what I'm pissed for (Why?)
Cause if you ain't worth a couple of dollars
These scholars looking like ""what do we need him for?"" (Huh?)
I'm saying, just because I ain't Kareem
You telling me I should give up on my dream?
You telling me I ain't shit cause I ain't working for degrees or on a team?
This country's flag is a joke
That shit should be painted green
Tell me when was currency valued over a human being?
When we stand for nothing, we falling for anything (Yeah)
But EST's for life and that's exactly what I'll scream
Misunderstood until they answer one thing (What's that?)

Should I give up?
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?

To live in the spotlight...

What if life was simple as a hug?
What if my partner wasn't crippled from a drug?
What if my other homie never caught a slug?
What if our parents actually gave a fuck?
Another black suit, another black suit
Police happy to see another black shoot
His mother's make up smearing on my arms, 
Crying cause' I'm the only son that she's got now that he's gone
What if the ghetto never heard an instrumental?
And we didn't have this rap shit all we had was metal? 
You telling me if we couldn't shoot a ball
Our lives still got shooting involved?
And what if I never left out of Denver that winter for new beginnings
My father started his business and traded family for riches?
You telling me that my auntie will still have a house to live in
And JoJo wouldn't be writing me from prison?
But fuck it this is life
Deal with it or get dealt with
I'm in my room smoking alone like I'm selfish
Cause' some days the sun's hard to face
Dad turns his son wears his face
But look closer see the heart of a lion
Sticks and stones couldn't damage my bones harder then iron
170 pounds with the walk of a giant
So defiant I pop a Valium, turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume

For all that it's worth

All of my demons come to life
And all that it was

Why should I kill myself for you?
You'd let me die?
(to live in the spotlight)
You'd let me die inside for you...

[Verse 2]
Look
What if money wasn't part of success?
Would the people I used to be friends with never left?
What if making a name didn't come with regrets?
I think that fame's a pre-cursor to death:
Death of a friendship
Death of a family
Death of a man
The misunderstood are always dead before 'they' understand
Staring at ceiling fans, chop up milligrams, draw a pentagram
Lucifer's not a rumor he's in the band, (damn)
Liquor and vomit on my Converse
Bright lights and packed concerts
And right next to the gun that's on my dresser are plastic orange bottles of peer pressure
And I'm ready to cave, I live in a cage
How can I be a hero when I'm the one needing saved
48 hour days of this fast lane living
Me and my entourage no Jeremy Piven, listen
It's better to burn out than fade away is what Kurt said
I felt the same until I saw his daughter and thought as a father
What if tomorrow; the only I could spoil her was dying?
Started crying then popped a valium turned up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume
Turn up the volume

For all that it's worth
To live in the spotlight
All of my demons come to life
And all that it was
And all that it could be

Why should I kill myself for you?
You'd let me die?
(to live in the spotlight)
You'd let me die inside for you...

[Outro]
So what you do when the cop lights
Turn into a stage and a spotlight?
And everyone around you starts to hate cause you got right
And feel entitled like I'm supposed to stop living my life?
Well this ain't 2Pac
This ain't Em's show
This ain't Jigga man

So in love that now all they wanted was pain and so it came
Never had a silver spoon present in the past
Now at last, the spoon is present and so the boy wet it
Told her bring him a slab, a cotton swab, and a match
And told her one day they’ll fly across the world and have a wedding
Like “baby I have a plan, come with me to this place
Baby give me your hand, now flip it give me a vein
Baby take off your belt, we’ll use it as a restraint”
She sees that it starts to melt, he reaches inside a case
Fills the needle with food, flicks the needle with haste
Brings the needle to her, she isn’t right in the face
The boy can tell that she’s scared, he says “I love you, okay?”
Then shoves it into her arm and says “how the fuck does that taste baby?!”

[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round
[Verse 2]
Her dress drops, her head drops
Swiggin’ out of a whiskey bottle, he just watches
But he was not Bobby, see Bobby had joined the army
Been gone for a couple months now she’s messin with everybody
Everyone of the dealers, everyone hears her squealing
Trading pussy for product, she did anything for that feeling
But then she started that feeling, early morning she’s kneelin’
In front of the toilet look at her belly there’s no concealing
That she’s expecting a child
This woman is living foul
She’s only 20 years old
And hardly can even smile
Ultrasound shows a baby that’s barely over a pound
Sold everything in her house just trying to score an ounce
News of her baby’s father was that he died in the war
Now that syringe is all that keeps her alive anymore
No mattress, so her and her child dyin’ on the floor
As a letter’s at the door reading:
“I’ll be home tomorrow. love, Bobby”

[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry, merry, merry go round
[Verse 3]
Knockin’ at the door but doesn’t get an answer
Bobby’s nervous, his heart starts to beat faster
He hasn’t talked to his girl in so long
She sold his phone for a hit, damn how he wish that he could hear her laughter
But his drug hit her like a cancer
And he forgot ‘cause he had left and cleaned his act up
Passenger seat in his Acura got a picture of ‘em kissing
Under the words ""happily ever after”
He walks into the house, it’s a fuckin’ disaster
Every step he takes his shoe crushes a capsule
Holds his breath, he knows what he smells isn’t natural
Looks down, it’s the body of the queen of his castle
“Baby please, baby please!!!""
""Wake up!!!”
He screams on his knees and he sees her hands around her stomach
Inside was a child
And realizes it was his…
*gun shot*
Summer day, 
An entire family died on that summer day
‘cause a facade made a girl give her love away
But those were Bobby’s consequences that he had to pay
Love is pain

[Hook]
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown
Merry go round...
Merry, merry, merry go round
I don’t want to see you down
I don’t want to see you frown

I fell flat on my face but didn’t lose
Was it the blue light
Gone fragile?
Was it above the man?
In wonder, steady going under...

[Machine Gun Kelly]
Tell them drain the pool I’m sinking fast
Come and save my life before it pass
Scratching at the surface but the bottom’s where I’m at
Only place my addiction will tell me that I’m free at last
So why the fuck you playing with my head? I said I’m done
Any and everything I had is gone I said you won
You promised that we’d only be together for a minute then we finish
But my life is passed another year why the fuck is you in it
Bitch I gave up everything for you even my house
Now I’m begging on a nightly basis to sleep on the couch
My counselor said I need to find a way to block the pain
I told him it was already too late she is in my veins and he said

[Yukimi Nagano]
Tell me what led you on, I’d love to know...

[Machine Gun Kelly]
Well, it’s just that, when I felt her the first time I flew
Nobody gives me the high that she do
See, we fight all the time and she leaves bruises on my arms
But the way she makes me feel inside that girl can do no wrong
Now all my family hates me since I started fuckin with her
And all my friends done left me cause they jealous that I’m wit her
I try to break it off but she gets me back with the feel
After everything she did why the fuck do I love that needle?
Please help me...

Twice I turned my back on you
I fell flat on my face but didn’t lose

Look, this love’s killing me, literally
Every time I start to pick you up, you finish me
Used to love waking up in the mornings and feeling you
Now I’m just ashamed wearin long sleeves concealing you
Bitch you wasn't shit, how the fuck could you do this?

Yeah, this one's for the mama that I never knew (Never knew)
I took acid just to burn all of my memories of you
I guess now I really wanna know the truth
How'd you leave your only child at nine for another dude?
Took that pain and punched my father in the stomach 'til he bled
Hit the store and stole a 40 and took that shit to the head
All the years that you ignored me, left me sleepless in the bed
I hope that he got some kids because your only son is dead
My revenge, got it in the end (In the end)
I'm so hard to reach, you won't see me again (Me again)
I spent 20 years waiting on the stairs
Now I'm finished thinking anyone will ever hear these prayers

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
If I die before I wake, smoke me out at Heaven's gate
Bring me back to life on Sunday, pour me up the devil's drink
Wake up, go to work on Monday, grind it out for seven straight
You showed me that just because we're blood don't mean we relate

Play with MGK and I will pull up where you stay (Yeah)

Up all night, mind cloudy, don't be spooked
If I show you love, then will you always tell the truth? (Truth)
Feel like I'm goin' crazy, couldn't trust no one but you (You)

Can we please start over, now that we're both sober?
Even though that won't last long

I pay them to lie to me
One of them girls gave her line to me
I spent my night at the strip club

I pay them to lie to me

Even if the highs feel low
Even if you couldn't sleep because you couldn't feel me underneath the covers when your eyes closed
I'm gettin' faded 'cause our love is fading
If I'm a monster then it's 'cause you made 'im
Beauty and the beast, now that's an ultimatum
Go with what you love, or follow what is gonna save you
Woah, I think we went somewhere we shouldn't go
Maybe it was Vodka, maybe it was blow
Maybe it was nothin', maybe it was both
Maybe it was the secrets I ain't want you to know
Maybe I wasn't leavin', maybe you made me go
Maybe there was a reason for our behavior tho
Maybe it was the pills or the house on the hills
Maybe it was the thrills, baby this love kills

You can't pass if you don't know the code word

[Verse 1: MGK]
Looking down at my phone, see another missed call
I'm pissed off, I never had these problems back when I was piss poor
Scared to see my daughter now because I'm lost in the life
In the bathroom getting high when she called twice
Sorry, but I'm scared to look at something so precious when I'm a mess
And her mother know it, I wonder if she ever regrets
Tryna convince my family that I'm only gone for these checks
When really I'm obsessed with getting my revenge through success
Cause people hated on me, how could I not show 'em?
Fans waited on me, damn, how do I not owe 'em?
Imagine having to make that decision
While baby girl's in the kitchen, tears dripping
Wondering where her pop's going
But I never meant to make you unhappy, can I see that smile?
Phone's ringing... ""Aye, yo, I'm with my child""
Anyways, I wanna write you a symphony
But instead she said all I ever wanted is you to stay a while, damn

Five years to be more specific
I was out here trying to sign to Atlantic
You crossed the Pacific
Now is it a coincidence that my first instrument was a violin
That my father wanted for me, so we ended up buying
And now the instrumental that we're vibing to got one high in it
And while I'm writing my first verse he called me up crying?
That shit is crazy, half a decade with no explanation
Now you're asking if it's too late to save us
Man, I don't know so I hang up without saying nothing, just click end
Wasn't man enough to say it so I wrote with a pen
I just wanted to make you happy, but you never smiled
I just wanted that phone call that said your daddy's proud
Anyways, maybe eventually we'll relive memories
And you'll be next to me and both of us can stay a while, yeah
[Outro]
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
I know you've been gone, gone, gone
But are you missing me?
I know you're missing me

And hey, hey, hey
It's been so long so you've gone away
And hey, hey, hey
It's been so long so you've gone away

[Outro: MGK & (Leroy Sanchez)]
One day I'll be gone
One day, one day, one day, one day I'll be gone

Yeah, it’s a long way home at the end of the road
I’ll be pavin my own way, to the top, I be here to stay
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
All my life, I couldn't fit in, like a bad shoe
I was always too square, too cube, too tall, too weird, too blue
Forget them high-school’s hotties now I'm too cool
I guess I came a long way from that young kid
The school's most popular lame, no friends, no style, no clothes, no ends
Just a bed, fell asleep, never woke up again ('Gain)
Yeah, and my last prayer was don't ever let me end up like the people that's down here
'Cause the one that fear change be the one that don't care
Look at themselves and see somebody else in the mirror
But you can always pick me out of the crowd
Loud mouth with my very own style
And what I know now is don't ever pretend
And live every single day like you won't see it again

[Chorus: blackbear and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s your last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's your dying day
[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
I dedicate this to my teachers that never believed in me
And the mother that conceived, but ended up leaving me
I just wish y'all could see me smile, this big's grin on the TV now, oh
And I took it from the bottom to the top
From the holes in my socks, Ramen noodles in the pot
Used to rob them on the block, now they stop me in the drop
Middle finger up and that ain't gonna stop
I used to take orders, now I make bets
I used to scrub floors, now I sign checks
I used to push carts, now I push songs
I used to be there, now I am so gone
I fired myself, found a job myself
Established my name and then I signed myself
And what I tell myself, is you did this by yourself
And when I'm on so long, I'll be by myself
I'm gone

[Chorus: blackbear and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it’s the last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's your dying day

[Verse 3: Machine Gun Kelly]
I wish I could see their faces when they heard your boy spit
Wish I could know what they're thinking when they heard my first hit
'Cause I remember them wishing that I wouldn't get big
Now I bet they’re wishing they wouldn't of said that shit
I came out of a dying city brought back life
Everything they said I couldn't do I did about twice
Multiplied by the bottles that we popped each night
That equals out to a celebration, bitches more ice
Make it toast to the underdogs, toast to the team
Toast to the fact we this close to the dream
Pour one for my exes, used to talk reckless
But now I push Benzes and rock Rolexes
Came from the city and until they come and get me
Turn around and see the whole east side's still with me
And that's how we live it, you mans don’t change
Look, it's still the kid, still can’t tell me a goddamn thing, Kells
[Chorus: blackbear and Machine Gun Kelly]
So take my name, remember this face, keep the change and have a nice day
And live for the moment, not by the past, homie live each day like it's the last
And if you only have 24 hours, 1400 minutes before your dreams gone
Then you better go live it, cause whatever you love could be taken away
So live like it's a dying day

[Outro: blackbear]

Promethazine at 13 muthafucka,
Everything slow motion, I'm not an earthling muthafucka
And you are not a girl your a goddess
Us  against world, girl I got us
Benihanas for them lame shits
She in the kitchen whippin cheese eggs with the same hand that she rolled the Js with
6 inch heels
5 course meals
4 years she's been my 32, my center like Shaquille
One time for my bad bitches
Whose mouths are sacreligious, cuz magic is a sin, and my dick always vanishes
Pictures on the cam of me shakin her ass
Cuz we drunk and wanna make this moment last
And the way yo back arch, when u lay on that cushion
The way yo toe's curl blowin smoke rings on the pussy
Make that muthafucka cream, from squeezin on her cookie
She want me to make her scream, I ain't a killer but don't push me
Police wanna lock me down, haters wanna shut me up
Bitches fuckin with me now, u was with me coming up
So Ima hold u down cuz u the only one that I can trust
2 fingers represent and throw it up, Lace up bitch

[Hook]
And when it all falls down, and there is nothin left
I'll still be around, Kells tatted on her breast
I look up to the stars, made a wish to have everything in a girl
Look down and there she is the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
You the baddest bitch in the world
Baddest bitch in the world
She crazy but I love my babygirl, baddest bitch in the world
[Verse 2]
Popped her cherry at 14 muthafucka,
Dropped out and now she pop it-pop it-pop it like the twerk team muthafucka
Embarrassed of the fact that she a stripper
But maybe that's the reason that I'm with her
Gave me excuses to fuck with these other hoes, while she dancin on a dick
Knowin that she can't say shit
Fighting every single night, but we fuckin every day,
But She know how to hold her own, and she do everything I say
Bad bitch, 
(what she do?)
 Left class just to pick me up and smash
We ain't even go inside I just fucked her on the dash
Bad boy, so she love it when I smack her on the ass
Friends jealous cuz they wantin what she have
Scars underneath my tatts, she be worried I just laugh
Sit back and roll a zig zag up with some hash and let it ash
Cuz if the world crash then at least we already fell into love
And the J already burnin so wassup, muthafucka 
It is us against the world so wassup, muthafucka 
Back against the wall so wassup

And when it all falls down, and there is nothin left

Yo, what up, man?
Send me that instrumental real quick
Which one?
""What's Poppin'""
Alright, got you right now
Yessir, let's go

[Chorus]
What's poppin'?
Just fucked my ex, I rawed it
Two X of the mushroom chocolate
Two X on neck, I'm frostbit
Stay dressin', no balsamic
Got commas, Comme des Garçons'd it
Cup got ice cubes like Compton
Chef Nobu, cook me raw fish

[Verse]
Long beards but the squad's not Amish
Just bosses, dropouts and convicts
Wallet's bigger than Chris Wallace
Dead presidents inside, it's haunted
Yellow tape where I'm from, stay cautious
Made mixtapes wearin' shirts with the horses
It's been a minute since I gave a fuck about a critic's
Opinion but they keep on forgettin' where the bars went
Old-timers, damn, y'all got Alzheimer's?
Can't say what your subconscious think
Be honest y'all hate that I switch genres
Fuck models, switch condoms
Eat beef like McDonald's
Eat rappers, Jeff Dahmer
Top five of the young rhymers
Been sick, no virus
I'm an OG now, I do not pay homage
Look, I'm a Cleveland Cavalier
Drivin' foreign engineer
At the Fashion Week in Paris
Cinderella on my terrace
Glass slipper on the stairs
Ass fatter than Shakira's
I saw her live at the Super Bowl
I was in town for a movie role
Toosie Slide in the booty hole
Smokin' woods, eatin' tuna roll
Playing cards like it's Yu-Gi-Oh!
And I was only in the studio
I wake up, I'm moody, I roll up some fruity
That have more colors than a Coogi coat
I'm not a rapper that talk 'bout designer
But this is from Virgil and Louis though
Inside my closet's a million options, I put on all black like a funeral
I hop out the plane in pajamas, I do this shit daily, I don't even plan it, woah
[Chorus]
What's poppin'?
Just fucked my ex, I rawed it
Two X of the mushroom chocolate
Two X on neck, I'm frostbit
Two eggs with cheese and sausage
I’m in bed, she fed me topless

[Outro]
Three X's next to the names of the last three hoes on my missed call list
Yeah, yeah, red eyes I can't see clear
Whoa, whoa, my brick so white, it glow
Damn, damn, she made an OnlyFans

Tell me lately, why we barely talk (Why?)
And you know I’m tryna change, but it's very hard

Life's been getting to me, I just started smoking squares (I’m stressed)
But they ain't getting in my circle though, we still prepared (For real)
I'm still dealing with some demons that ain't really there
Grew up a screw-up, pierced my ear and dyed my fucking hair (Like that)
In 7th grade, I didn't have a bed, I had to share (For real)
The fuck you think I go so hard for? I got out of there (I'm gone)
Have you ever had somebody try to take your life? (Huh?)
Sometimes, I ain't safe from myself when I stay up at night

Look, I promised myself I ain't never going home (Not at all)
9 years old, my momma left me in the cold (Goddamn)
Ay, what do you think that type of shit do to your soul?
Find someone that finally love me, still I treat her like a hoe (That shit is fucked up)
Damn, it be the shit that they don't know (That they don’t know)
I only smile in public just for show
I know they tried to warn me 'bout my dose
You know them kids be with the Ye and now them kids be seeing ghosts

There's nothing but blue skies

There's nothing but blue skies
(Throw it up when you see me)

Look, never had a cent now I got a bent
I ain’t talkin Bentley’s, I’m talkin' a bitch
I got her bent over she bustin' them splits
Lookin' up at the star, I’m tellin' her make a wish
Hoes come around me tryna leave rich
But I give ‘em no shit so they leave pissed
Fuck ‘em, here's to the night, like Eve 6
My partner ain’t gotta put the dough in the deep dish
Mic check, can you hear me?
I’m loud as a symphony
Smoke in my lungs, I’m a chimney
Get it in your head like epiphanies
Realize I am Prince Akeem, I roll with the semi
So many repent me, part of ‘em resent me
They think I’m Lucifer, I think God blessed me
I was in hell while you rappers on Jet ski’s
How in the fuck can yo raps represent me?
I was on ten, now I’m on fifty
I just spent a hundred, tell ‘em roll it up quickly
I just got a hundred missed calls from the city
Keep it 100, everybody fuck wit me
Keep it 100, Kells, Keep it 100
Fuck ya’ll, you don’t know nothing
I keep it 3 thou like Andre
I done been an Outkast since I came up out mom's stomach
I been smoking weed since I was a fetus
Lil bad mothafucka, needed Baby Jesus
Tryna be a millionaire, where the fuck Regis?
Leaders of the new school and we all teachers
First lesson: blue skies, blue dream, red eyes and catch red eye
Fuck the real world, Kells
[Chorus]
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, for real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, stay real
Throw it up when you see me, roll one up when you see me, for real

If ya’ll ride wit me, roll one up and get high wit me
Turn it up and then vibe wit me, fuck the real world
If ya’ll ride wit me, roll one up and get high wit me
Turn it up and then vibe wit me
Kells!

[Verse 2]
24/7 I’m putting in work
Came from the gutter, no stain on my shirt
You know the Land is where champions birthed
So I hold the title till I land in the dirt
Motorcycles, auto-rifles, and purp
Overnight they think I tripled my worth
Gotta stay ready, these haters will lurk
But this ain’t what you want, now I’m feelin like Durk
(This ain’t what you want)
Sing that shit to ‘em like Gerald Levert
Couldn’t sleep on me with Ambien first
Let the kid nap like an Amber alert
Wake up and you know I had to get turnt
Bottle of Jameson matching my shirt
Back on the road, gotta pack up the merch
And I smoke so much tree that I damage the earth
Yeah, EST runs shit
Don’t make me get on my young shit
Don’t get me talking that gun shit
Don’t make me turn this whole thing to a function
Don’t make assumptions
I’m from the C, I ain’t talkin bout Compton
I’m from the 6, I ain’t talkin Toronto
Bitch I’m from Cleveland, you know the motto
I’m the city’s Lucky Luciano, the gunner!

I'm humble because I know what it feels like to be at the bottom and have nobody
No fans, no nothing, nobody believing in you
Now look at me...
I was down on the ground with nobody
Some in my town said my sound was a hobby
Now that I'm crowned they're astounded and oddly
They try and come around, now I'm somebody

[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Middle finger in the air with a hope and a prayer, I started this
Never had no money then my daughter hit
That was a get-up-and-hustle-nigga starter kit
Hard to spit, bars to get, at stars when it's, not marketed
You're far from it, dark and your partner quit
Really barking, you wishing for the spark to get a heart in your art a bit
But they doubted me 'cause I'm nothing like them, never knew how to be
Stylistically foul, and he's proud to be wild and he's
Thinking now is time to get the crowd shouting
Now people found him, it's, ""Wow, peep his salary""
Way back when I was feeling defeated (Rrr)
When inspiration, motivation was needed (Rrr)
At the pace to be great, I've exceeded
All of your expectations, you fakers can eat it!
This my world, this my game
All the wicked shit is coming out of my brain
This is my girl, music is my dame
If you can get it I'm a keep it P.I., mane
Why not share the pie? Scared that I
Would get the people liking me and wouldn't dare to buy your shit
Try to told ya before that my flow sick
Milli' sold on the road with my whole clique
Everybody listenin' to Witness, Tech's whirlwind
In the club with MGK, thick sex twirling
Fought to the top, never did stop, now we got it, it's ""Fuck the world"" then
The haters in the past on my ass wanna come around like my ex-girlfriends
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
(Gone) Uhh, for the block I (Go) to that spot I (Go) to the top I (Go)
Screaming ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
And that's real, how I feel 24/7 in a city where the weak men die
Doing whatever we gotta do to survive
Head to the sky, middle finger up high
Scream ""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""
""Fuck the world"" (Fuck the world)
Screaming ""Mothafuck the world""

[Verse 2: Twista]
Twista, I remember thinking I would rather die
Then go through what I was going through when I was struggling to survive
Full of ambition and I'm ready to ride
No tragedy over triumph and I am a Lion I gotta try
Full of drama, I was feeling like a failure
Fiending for the industry again, I was living in disgust
Doing odd jobs, everybody seeing me
Traveling to work, back and forth on the bus
Yeah, I was fucked up
But I got it together for y'all
Spit venomous lyrics cause I was ready to ball
Started Po Pimping on everybody
And certain mothafuckers that want to get in my circle I tell them naw
Cause I got to get money up in my anatomy, naturally
And I gotta be gradually happy to holla
At somebody when they speak and they might be on that bullshit
So sometimes it’s ""Fuck them"", I don’t even bother
And who knows what's next for three angels chasing dreams
Hailing from the Midwest, as we spread our wings
All of us striving to surf over the summit
Creating us a vision that would be stunning
When we come to Earth and your city and do a show
You would get to see everybody from miles come running
Yelling for Machine Gun Kelly
And Tech N9ne and Twista get it in, better bring something smelly
We could take it to another level, wherever you wanna go
Everybody put they hands up, I'm ready
Come on and get wild let loose
Celebrate the fact that you made it and let me see you get buck
You done been through some shit
But you did it cause you had the heart to throw the middle finger up, yeah

Ugh, whoever would've imagined Lace Up could've got me to the finish like track meets?
And when everybody’s hot, I'm past heat
And if I don't need the fuel, don't gas me (Yeah)
It's been a long time coming since 100 Words And Running
Mothafucker come catch me
And while these other rappers pen and pad it
I was 13, with a semi-automatic
Anything we ever wanted then you know we gotta have it
Don’t anybody ever snitch, get pinched, you forget like magic
Kids carry tools like go-go gadget (Blah)
Leaving high school to an open casket
Now another baby in the stomach of his baby's mother
Never gonna know his daddy, tragic
Why's the government gotta lie to get money? (Huh?)
Why's the federal reserve gotta take from me? (Why?)
Why should I be fighting for another country?
Have you seen my city mothafucka? We hungry! (Urghh)
Representing for the middle of the map even though me and mine are coming from the bottom (Waddup)
Why do all greats fall when it isn't autumn?
Where would Pac be at if nobody would've shot him?
You really think that Notorious B.I.G would believe these guys? (Nope)
All these internet thugs that the media finds?
You wanna talk about grind?
Look at me in the encyclopedia, what name is in it?
I bet you see mine, motherfucker that's Kells
Skinny boy, six foot three
Heart bigger than an SUV
Lord knows I been through hell and back
Ducking jail and crack
And still, I came out on T-O-P
So this is for the kid who never had a father figure to depend on
Spending every school day being sent home
Feeling like he doesn't know anybody
Because the only thing he ever had to him was some headphones
So he pick a song, and he turn 'em on
Every morning just to get him through the day
Looking for an escape and the kick in the bass
That's the story of MGK
Lace Up!

See I've been searchin' for somethin' out there
When is it comin'? Tell me
What to tell myself
When I drink so much that it hurts my health
'Cause I stay up way too late
And I owe a million favors
I can't overstress myself
So I wrote it down to express myself
I'm lookin' in the mirror tryna find
Peace of mind in a piece of my
Inspiration back from the beginning
Life's a movie, I can't make revisions
Ate an eighth of shrooms and started trippin'
Had some visions that were nonexistent
I think I just left the solar system
Doesn't matter, I still kept the rhythm
Diamonds still gon' light up like a prism
That's from years of grindin' independent
What was at the bottom now has risen
If this isn't Heaven then what is it?
Always real but never realistic
Want the world but nothin' in specific
Don't need shootin' stars to grant my wishes
I'm a superstar, let's go and get it

Kiss the ski-i-i-i-i-i-ies, the sky

Now can I, lay underneath you?
While they play all the previews
And I'll pretend like I'm restin'
Maybe you'll skip to the end and
Pass all the irrational decisions
Patch up all the passion that was missin'
I think that's enough, I'm feelin' lovesick
Rollin' loud, I'm on some turnin' up shit
Paid a couple hundred for a high that I couldn't get on my own (on my own)
And I've been lookin' for a long time, but I never found home
Everything is alright, I'm around for the long ride
Go get drunk and find some trouble (ayy)
Add some pieces to the puzzle (ayy)
Couple rights, couple wrongs
That's the prequel to the sequel (yeah)
And all the space in between us
Are memories that we conceal
The jagged edges of a pill
Remember what it is to feel
Windows down behind the wheel
Gotta do it for the thrill, watch me

Uh, this ain't no halo over my head, bitch
But dear God, can you forgive the sinning
For everything I done did since my beginning
Because the devil around me so much that you would think I got a death wish?
Yeah, and the voices in my head get louder
Watching my career disappear like powder (Poof)
Wish I could rewind those hours and get my life back (Back)
Strike that, clinging to this weed like a life jacket (Yeah)
Fuck rapping, I was really living everything that I was spitting, bitch
What's happening? (Wassup)
Fights daily, nights crazy, dream chasing till the drugs came in
I was chopping up them bitches like Jason
Had a muthafucker's face laying on the cold pavement (Uh)
Wake up, take 'em, now I feel sane (Whoop)
Spending every penny in the studio slaving (Yeah)
Me and my mob working any odd job
Praying that this little dream was gonna feed our babies
Save me Lord, save me Lord, what the fuck is this curse you gave me Lord?
Everybody think I finally made it Lord, but all I am now is a slave, my God

[Interlude]
And Revelation says
""He will wipe every tear from their eyes and death shall be no more
Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore
For the former things have passed away""
EST for life, muthafucker!
[Verse 2]
Ughk, put that halo around my neck, bitch (Bitch)
And gimmie death
I'm twenty-two and this twenty-two on my left, God bless
Maybe I'll finally sleep
Maybe they'll return what's originally mine, cause finder's keep
Maybe I will be great, and this voice of mine was designed to be the finest key
But, I'm losing faith (Ok)
Everyday they got news to break
Like my single flopped, and now I ain't hot
And they don't know if Imma ever gonna see the light of day
It's ""My labels mad"" or ""My albums bad"" or ""You ain't living up to the hype we thought you had""
Or I lost a fan, or I'm in cuffs again
Yeah, meanwhile I ain't there to be my daughter's dad
Fuck what's meant for me, because I don't ever wanna become a celebrity
I don't ever want someone to feel less than me
So put your camera down and stand next to me (Right here!)
EST, Everyone Stand Together
And if I, ever R-I-P, then I know everything I stand for's forever
Lace Up!

[Outro]
And when you play this song
Hold your head high, muthafucker
Don't ever look down because of who you are
Our flaws are what makes us perfect38Embed"

They told me to write a soundtrack 
For the kids who ain't have shit 
No problem, flashback me 2006 
Broke as piss, scraping bus fare up
Dolla fifty cents, get out of school and go to work
Matter fact fuck all this I quit
I got a dream that we gon change the world soon 
And one day get the fuck outta this bedroom
Maybe write a song for the girl who cries when she thinks of her past
But just press play, I tell her smile and then she laughs, look at that, yeah
Music makes the world go round 
And the ones in search of freedom generates into a crowd 
All it takes is one believer with a voice to introduce us to what’s real
And since my throat is clear I guess that’s why I’m here
Chyeah 
See my teachers told me go away to college
But what they don’t tell you is ain't no guarantees if you’re a scholar 
Even with 18 degrees, you could be jobless with Uncle Sam in your pockets
So I said fuck my doctrines
Rapped and made more money than these doctors
Now one day ill be too fly driving three girls in my four door while these five J's make a fellowship of smoke rings bitch I’m Frodo lost it all this year but bounced back like a pogo, Kells, 

[Hook]
And we just watch the sun turn into the moon 
Sit back and hope that these December nights turn into June
See it started as a dream, that dream came true
Send a message to my city tell them we'll be home soon, home soon
And we just watch the sun turn into the moon 
Sit back and hope that these December nights turn into June
See it started as a dream, that dream came true
Send a message to my city tell them we'll be home soon, home soon
[Verse 2]
And I’m like what we waiting round for
Found something to celebrate now we on round four 
Ground floor was the past now the sky is the limit penthouse edition 
Exhibit a: a bunch of young muhfuckas livin 
I used to hustle to get it
Used up all of my minutes 
In hopes of one of my ex's telling me she owned a business and heard bout my situation here’s a check for a million 
But this is reality and charity don’t go to sinners 
But clarity comes in pinners of marijuana and splinters 
An absentee in attendance at all my high school events 
I just wasn’t fond of attention when all I had was resentment 
I started out as a freshman and graduated a henchman 
I worked my way up to Jimmy 
Worked my way up the totem 
And those who hated on me was just adding weight to my scrotum
See life is a poker game I got the hand now I ain't folding
I’m King Midas touch my future with this hand now that shits golden, whoo
One day ill be too fly whippin three girls in my four door while these five J's make a fellowship of smoke rings bitch I’m Frodo lost it all this year but bounced back like a pogo, man I swear to God

On a east side night
Under that street light
On the corner of don’t think twice
I find my mind where it shouldn’t be

[Verse 1]
Crack Rock in that pad lock
With a stash spot in my ragtop
Street dreams down the block from my dads spot
Bad cops on my payroll
At a buck a pop like Faygo
Add 50 Cent for like 3 keys
Open up the doors for that Yayo
White nights cuz I make snow
Bright lights then I lay low
Fight nights I'm like Mike Tyson
K/o for that peso
That's the life that we chose
Talking bout
Money cars and these clothes
Fuckin with
Twenty broads that's exposed
And we in the
Strip clubs till they close
These are the chronicles of a hood muthafucka doin what he gotta do to get paid
Chronic smoke In every follicle of my shades
Writing  my obituary diggin my grave
Cuz all they say is jail or death,
And I figure there ain't nothin left
That I ain't did and since I’m knee deep in my shit, don’t hold my breath
*Snap* Oh shit
Guess its back to that broke shit
Roach clip in my ashtray
2Pac on my posters
Dreams of living like Sosa,
But I'm wakin up on this sofa,
Said I'm wakin up on this sofa
I ain't waiting round here no longer
Get it how you live it bitch we livin dirty
Most of us that's livin now ain't livin thirty
Get it how you live it bitch we livin dirty
Cock that .38 put on my mask and it gets blurry
I don't think you heard me
[Hook]
What I need a shirt for?
When you beast shit and you go hard till that tours gone and you back onto that street shit
What I need this shirt for?
When these tattoos that I bleed with say everything about my story come read this
What I need a shirt for? Huh? X3
When I go hard
So hard, to get everything that I worked for

[Verse 2]
At the top is no friends dawg
At the bottom ain't shit dawg
Middle man'n ain't it dawg
Plotting drinkin this Hen dog
And I said lord my savior
Have I not protected my neighbor
Have I not neglected these haters
Have I not kept you in my prayers
So when my life keeps going downhill am I wrong for looking upstairs?
Am I wrong for feeling you hate me, am I wrong for thinking you'd care?
Am I wrong for keepin this weed lit and these smoke clouds In this air?
But I can't sleep without my mind gone cuz of shit I witnessed last year
That boy that left out was just family
I ain't see the shit comin
We was supposed to be at these Grammy’s
We was supposed to be stuntin
Shit,  we was supposed to somethin
Fuck that we was supposed to be brothers
Helped you out when you were struggling, I don’t owe you nothing muthafucka

My walk is so cocky the bouncers don't even stop me
Ain't no pat down, no ID
They know me, that shit obvi
Bitch I pack out the lobby just from fans tryna find me
I got daughters and mothers tryna fuck with the gunner
Two tone suit like the Joker
My Harley Quinn wears a choker
Let them suicide doors up
So much smoke, can't photo us
I'm out west like the gold rush, 1942 poured up
I ain't spent one night sober since I turned 20 years old
But I'm on my Jeezy in 2005 ""Trap or Die"" shit
That everything 100, this ain't no facade shit
This that ""Look me in my eyes and don't you fuckin' lie"" shit
Still don't need no opinions
Bitch, most these artists my minions
Whoa
Yeah, turnt
Any weed around me finna get burnt
No lie, I'm on fire
Hogtie anybody need a realization that they fuckin' with the wrong guy
I am the Alpha Omega, came from Sonic on a Sega
Crumblin' chronic on the table
Mumbling lyrics in the basement
Like I'm finna go Super Saiyan
I'm saying, I ain't have a plan coming out the land
Hanging with my man, tryna slang a gram
Just to rent a van, just to try and tour
Turn some common clothing in to couture
Still muddy from the sewer
Look at all that I've endured
All them years I couldn't afford
Friends thats in the morgue
We are not the same, say the fuckin' name

I am the gunner (The gunner, the gunner)
I am the gunner (The gunner, the gunner)

[Verse 2]
Let's do this for real
Super sonic, super sonic
Psychedelics and some chronic
Still remain the trending topic
Five movies, let's be honest, what you call it?
That's a major motion picture wallet
No, I do not want to comment
Don't approach me, I am violent
Snapping pictures 'cause I'm styling
Let me make it very fucking clear who I am
Do not start assuming, let me clear confusion
I am not a human, they call me a giant
I pick up the mic and I start a riot
I spit a verse and I change the climate
Fuck a dealer, man, I need the pilot
Drop the weight off like he on a diet
Hanging off of the balcony of the Hyatt
I started with one, then I multiplied it
Now I got me 3 women like Frankie Lymon
And I got me a double X made in diamonds
Bitch, the dynasty never dying
Someone ring the sirens, I just broke the silence
I just sparked the loud up, who the fuck can stop us?
I resort to violence, no resorts and islands
You know where to find us

Okay, I don't know 'cause you're so high or, like, you get really drunk, so I don't know if you remember it
Of course I do
Okay
I cherish it
I burn other memories just to make room for those ones
That was four months ago that we were right here and I met you
That's not possible
Like, you just got my initials tattooed on you
I got your nickname tattooed on me

It's gettin' hard to fake how I feel when your face still taunts me

I ran away and hit the trap, they couldn't make me budge
Junior year, my homie selling crack right off the bus
Knew that I wasn't turning back when I got cuffed
Fuck a charge, this a territory, y'all don't wanna march
Cemetery full of graves, I can finish what you start
Lost a milli when they sued me for a fight inside a bar
I hope you pussies think of me every time that you see the scar
[Chorus]
This that mothafuckin' rider, music
This that mothafuckin' rider, music (Eastside, ayy)
This that mothafuckin' rider, music
This that mothafuckin' rider, music (Turn up)
All night, when I'm rollin'
Dirty, how many times you gon' play with death before you thirty?
But I'm chosen, so I'm rollin'
With 11 of my closest, on a mission to get rich like Danny Ocean, how we rollin'
All through traffic with this mob apparatus
These people want me in a casket, still I'm rollin'
I heard Heaven got a place for me there, but I don't know if I'm goin', uh

[Verse 3]
Yeah, 24/7, I keep my eyes open, ready
All these signs show me they want me gone like I'm Makaveli
On the cross when they cross me over, over something so petty
Kill 'em all even if I die like Method Man did in Belly
I am... Gun Kelly, ain't shit you can tell me
Get me drunk and mad enough, I go pop the trunk of the Chevy
I'm a dad and a savage, this is not an image like Getty
Rap for currency, like I'm Spitta Andretti and let it fall like confetti
Ball for my dogs that they got locked in the celly
And fuck the one that turned on me, I won't ever forget it
You learn it's your own homies you knew since the beginning
That see you winning and then wanna see you finished

And they say they know me...
Get the fuck outta here
Only God knows what I've been through, man
So if you wanna talk, get your facts straight first
And if you really wanna know, let me ask you something...

[Verse 1]
Have you ever walked in the shoes of a giant?
Or had to fill the position of a boss before you were even a client?
It's no wonder growing up under the roof of a tyrant
That I would be the poster boy for defiance
Now I'm the voice of the silence
Fuck being quiet I've seen twenty years worth of violence
I'm tired, it's a burden for me to open my eyelids
Not an undercover cop but it's safe to say that I'm wired
I can't even get a grip on my life with pliers
I'm fucked up in the head
Close my eyes cause I see demons around my bed
So depressed, open them up hoping I'm dead
Thought the fame would make it better but it only fucked me over
Never used to touch a bottle, now I'm hardly ever sober
People want to be my friend
But where the fuck were y'all when I was ten
Eleven or twelve getting bullied and beat up in the gym?
I couldn't never get a girl, now all the sudden I'm the man
Students try to get back cool with me again, fuck 'em all
Because guess where they're gon' be when my record stops playing?
Gone with the wind, off in the record shop saying that ""Kells fell off""
I knew it would happen, stop hating, cause a month ago you was all over my jock saying
That I'm ""that mu'fucker""
But now I'm whack, mu'fucker?
Opinions change, but you cannot change facts mu'fucker
If you want bullet points then call me a gat mu'fucker
I'll lay my whole life out like a mat mu'fucker
Man, I've experienced some things that would stop you from eating
My schizophrenic cousin tried to end my life while I'm sleepin
My bummy uncle wanna call now that he sees me succeeding
My momma left me for a teacher, lost my dad to the preaching
Half my friends are buried six feet, all the rest in the precinct
Literally watched my Grandmother die from Diabetes
I guess my prayers were answered when my Aunt got Cancer and beat it
Now I want to get her out a job, give her the garden of Eden
I did a lot of bad shit, God got even
But for the price I had to pay, I wish I'd stopped breathing
My girl sat in the bathtub, eight hours bleeding
Hearing the doctor tell us our child's heart stopped beating
Fuck a million, I wouldn't take a dollar for a life
But I will do what's in my heart, and trade this dollar for a mic
I wrote this song in hopes that it could help someone get through the night
With no intentions of getting paid, I'm just doing what is right
I do it for the fans, no, the real fans
Who stuck with me through the storm cause they understand
That there's a genuine pain behind the words I'm saying
And they embrace me, so I thank y'all for staying
Ain't it crazy, that passion is my achilles heel?
Either that or keeping it way too real
But they don't know how it feels, to feed off the energy of a crowd
Step on stage and they get loud
Dad, I'm gonna make you proud
I know we don't speak right now but I think turning new leaves is what we need right now
I love you
And you may not see right now but I'm begging for forgiveness, I'm on my knees right now
You saw your son as a dropout
Stuck around when I ran
Saw your son as a felon
Now see your son as a man
See your son be a father, to a beautiful child
Or just see your son Dad, see me smile
Who would have thought what started at the bottom would someday grow?
From three people in the crowd, unpaid shows
Six people in the room, one meal a day
Another opening act where no one knows my name
Saw the demos that I passed out laying on the ground
Saw the rappers I befriended copying my style
Saw opportunities pass while these fakes got rich
Now I can't stop speeding like my breaks ain't shit
For six months I went through hell and back
Right at the height of my success all of the sudden doctors said I couldn't rap
I had a polyp on my vocal chords
Left with a choice, stop now or possibly lose my voice
But I woke up and recorded every morning till my throat swole shut
Coughed blood after every show because it hurt that much
I went weeks without even saying a word to myself
No health insurance so doctor bills piled on the shelf
But for my daughter and my fam, and every single fan
I pushed through it, now I'm back for y'all again
As for my competition, this is the beginning of the end
But right now this is my return, amen
Kells

Ay yo
This that shit you bob your head to
This that brand new instrumental
I heard he puts his city on
That boy Kells so influential
Success got everybody hating
Success to me is inspiration
Cause how we supposed to know that what we dream is possible
If don't nobody that looks like us makes it?
You only got one life, don't waste it
I mean we only got one night, get wasted
I mean I know you're trying to think it out
But go with what you feel cause real problems can't be calculated
It's hard to find the answer when they have no explanation
It's hard to find where you're headed when there's no destination
It's hard to know when we're going when there's no expiration
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

[Hook]
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long
Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

[Verse 2]
Drinking whiskey like a desperado
My bitches drinking Reposado
Ashing in an empty bottle
Listening to the songs that put our asses in this empty condo
Remember ridin' 'round in Ashleigh's car though?
When the radio first played our song though?
Or at her house when MTV first showed my face
That clip was crazy, I swear it felt like we won the lotto
But a million bucks can't buy priceless moments
An a million people may not know us
But every one of us wants this gift we own
And that is: how is how to keep it real
How to never judge somebody by their steering wheel
Cause you know that mother fucker in that Ford Taurus
Could be the next mother fucker in that new Porsche
But like I said it's hard to know where you're headed
When there's no destination
So until that day, just keep that Kells inside your playlist and

Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

Bring those speakers up on blast, play it all night long

[Outro]
This shit right here, man, this shit feels right! Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it’s all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucka, drunker than a motherfucka, with my boys, and I’m thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn’t go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I’m driving us there, but my license’s suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like “Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over"" cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I’m opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body’s laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting’s with the record label started at 2 and we didn’t have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name’s James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don’t know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could’ve died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I’m not feeling this shit man I’m not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she’s like “Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now."" I’m like, ""who?” She’s like “He’s gonna call you in 30 seconds."" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called “Chip off the Block” over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: “Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you."" I said, god damn, life’s about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes thats all it takes, it’s just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I’m here

Feel that, uh
Lace up, Kells

Who the fuck want it with him?
We ball like the Indians at the World Series 8th inning
I'm gone, rolling with Nicole Kidman
I hit the pussy like a bong, fuck show business
We in the jungle with the guerrillas
We in the streets with the 4 wheelers
Don't speak I am no witness
You got beef?
Put an end to you talking like long sentence, period
Motherfucker I'm serious
Who ya favorite rapper, I'm curious?
He ain't living out them words
He ain't used Machine Gun's verse on the track cause his ass got murdered
I'm talking in the 3rd
I'm talking to a stealer and he ain't from the Burgh
You talking to a Cleveland motherfucker in the first
So you better not get on my nerves, biatch
I need herb tho, keep me moving like turtle
Keep me seeing this purple
Keep it banging like Kirko
Work something, twerk something
Bitch fuck me now she worth something
Gas tank on E, it  ain't worth fronting
Try to stunt on me the worst coming
Motherfuckers gonna need some plumbing I am the shit
And I feel like eating something
Feeding my stomach
Give me a rapper, make it a hundred
Fuck it, give em the hubble telescope
They couldn't see the youngin'
No, fuck it let 'em get a lil something
Bring em to the block do a lil stuntin', that ain't nothing
Everywhere where I go I'm putting on
I ain't bluffing
Everywhere where I go I'm putting on

Picture me rich
Picture everybody with a picture of me hangin' on the wall like Prince
Picture your favorite R&B singer
Lookin at a picture on her phone of my big ol' dick
Picture me living like Biggie
The real Frank White, I'm the king of my city
Picture all this shit starting as a dream
Staring at a picture of  Martin Luther King
Bitch that's my reaction
Trying to make it happen from rapping
Trying to avoid me a casket
Half of my kin-folk caught up in traffic from trapping
My whole squaddone turned to a fraction
Cause Tony Montana right up the block from us, dawg
It's hard not to get caught up in it at all
Hard not to ball
Sales for yayo, then jail, then someone goes talk to the law
Please God tell me it ain't true
Tell me name on that paper work ain't you
If you ain't snitching then why is you home
Stupid decision bitch better get gone
3 in the morn, I can't get rest so I turn over pick up that .38 special
You bust in my door, then I bust at your neck hoe
25 stranded on death row

You could go hard or you could go home
You could live life or you could just fold
Let it go (Oooh)
'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Look, I started with a dollar and a dream, right
So I can show these people how to dream, right
I could show 'em how to aim for the stars
And take it to the arenas from the street lights
Damn, oh this is what the top feels like? (Whoa)
I still remember Ramen noodle meal nights
I still remember checkin' my account
And having 26 dollars when I signed my record deal nights
And I remember being cold
In my apartment, used the heater from the kitchen stove
Highs and Lows, that's how it goes
So I gotta roll somethin' up
Just to cope with the pressures of growin' up, man

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
What a week
We made it to the bar 'cause we need to heal up
You gotta play for keeps
'Cause Aces tend to stay with dealers
You got to believe it
But I'm a sinner too so I ain't preachin'
Just keep on dreamin'
'Cause all the bad days come for good reasons

You could get high or you could get low
You could stay young or you could grow old

'Cause I'ma I'ma go for broke

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
Yeah, and if I had a dollar
For everytime they told me what I wouldn't be
I would be a rich man with a crib on a big hill (for real)
But I gotta work to get paid
Earn my own way
Work the third shift, burn the whole spliff
Since birth I've been... (Hold up, let me get it)
Look, failure was not an option, I gotta be at the top
Like I'm sorry, but I don't really feel sorry for y'all
I'm sorry I got a new number that you can't call
I'm sorry to everyone who still wants me to fall
Hold up, you know what, I ain't sorry at all

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly]
So I, hope that it was worth it when you searching
And you find what glitters ain't gold
And I, knew I wasn't perfect but I know that I made it all on my own

So I let it go, I just hit the road, I just let it go

I wake up screaming in my sleep every fuckin' night
Open up my eyes to cold sweat, bloody clothes from my nose
Erhk - Nothing nice
Father, I've killed a man, but I had to do it

My skin is blue-ish, voices in my head saying

Ain't like I'm talking for the wealth, 'cause there ain't no money in the truth (Ah ha)
Shit, I'll live this shit for real, y'all make it up in the booth (Oh)
Till a nigga lose his tooth over some shit he didn't plan on
Wasn't prepare for, really couldn't stand on
[Verse 4: Machine Gun Kelly with DMX]
Fuck it, turn the cam on, tie his feet and his hands up and watch him
I'll be back up with that heat to get his tan on
Now that's for fucking with me (gunshot)
And that's for my dog
This because where you going you not gonna need that arm
The street's is talking, ""Uh oh, there they come""
Thirsty for that blood (Redrum, redrum)
Do you know how it feels to be so mad you would kill?
Or to be so trapped when you scream your throat cuts like jagged pills?
And whenever you close your eyes everything inside you dies
And all the high's, crimes, and lies come alive, muthafucka

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & DMX]
I swear that I can feel 'em fucking with me (Why?)
Every night I feel 'em fucking with me (Why?)
Please God tell these demons stop fucking with me (Why?)
Every God damn night I feel 'em fucking with me (Why?)
Please God

Tommy had everything you could want as an adolescent except for having fun
Tommy was young
Susceptible to all the repercussions of being a drunk fathers only son
Tommy was dumb
Get your ass in that room till I come back you piece of shit
But dad would never come..
Tommy was dumb
Students would laugh at him and attack him after their classes until Tommy would run
Tommy was numb
Too many years of feeling degraded now hatred is the only feeling that comes
Tommy was numb
Fuck this
Ran into his high school

But Hailey's in 7th grade entertaining and dating a 21 year old scrub
Hailey's in love
Bailing on class to give him some action in the back of his daddy’s old truck
Now Hailey threw up
A couple weeks after their interaction, guess her man didn’t use no glove
Hailey knew but
Couldn’t bear it to watch the parents she loved and cherished see their little girl knocked up

Got the word about what happened now even the faculty is whispering that she’s a slut

Wake up, still drunk from last night
The first dates are always uncomfortable
Stayed up, I couldn't sleep last night
I'll admit, I'm a little dysfunctional
Are you okay with the fact I'm a little off track?
To be honest, I've been through relationships
I've never been in love, but I want this

Ever since you walked away, I can't wait to taste your breath
Sunset on my black parade, and I can't wait to see what's next
When the clothes are off, and the phones are off
And the lights are on, 'cause you turn me on

[Verse 2]
Pick up, pick up your phone
I know you just gave me your number but I wanna know
What's up with us because I got a feeling
Tell me if it's mutual
Are you with anybody right now?
Or could you step out and talk to me?
I'd text you, but it's better to call
'Cause tomorrow there'll be less that I have to delete

Cleveland on my back L's up when you see me
Came from the underground now they on tv swear to god haaan
Ain't shit changed 
Fool
You can miss me with that rap shit
You can miss me with that stereotypical ""he isn’t lyrical"" barbershop chat shit
Miss me with that frat shit
Only university I graduated was Hard Knocks
I’m from Cleveland where they trap shit
Five bucks for the catfish, five bucks for the bad bitch
Five bucks in a drought in this city could get you a piece of that cactus
With saran wrap for the wrapping
Whatchu mean?
Meaning we bundling all of this loud into Garcia Vegas 
I swear its contagious the way that we passed it
Patches on my denim vest about as old as my dad is
Blood stains on my chucks cus well we know what that is
Jet lag from these long flights still sitting coach like its practice
Feeling like students when the schools back I’m trying to see what first class is 
Cash is the root of all evil
But maybe that’s why I do bad shit
Fact is, I do what I need
Cuz the country we live in is fascist
And no Catholic or Baptist, warlord or pacifist, could’ve seen what I seen without IMAX's and 3D glasses 
Yall in family houses like Bob Saget 
Both parents 
I was on family couches like ""you don’t want it?"" ill wear it
Inheriting hand me downs as a grown man, embarrassed
And these dreams seem far-fetched 
When reality is you’re sharing a shirt, shower, and shitter while your newborns in the carriage
Packaging groceries in bags for an hourly seven dollar average
This ain't living this is strife, mixed with Hennessey and some sprite
But maybe one day they’ll remember me like they remember Mike 
When I’m gone 
Uh, Kells 
Maybe they’ll remember me when I’m gone
[Hook 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
When my times up on this earth
And they bury me in the dirt
Don’t say that I ain't milk this life for everything that its worth ( everything that its worth) 
And when I die remember me like Kurt, BANG!

[Verse 2: Dub-O]
And they say Dub quit with that humble shit
You can only be cool for so long 
 Don’t misjudge  I’m not the one you wanna rumble with
Write it down, take a pic
Do whatever you gotta do to remember me
I’m in your memory for infinity 
And the same goes for your bitch 
Remember me from Kennedy 
Or East High on the east side where niggas die over anything
Yeah, Dub-O, 
Oh, you ain't know?
I got go, I rock shows, I be calling plays like Flaco, 
But I’m so Cleveland its a damn shame 
And EST is my damn gang been reppin that since way back and that double X is my campaign 
Pop bottles that champagne its Cliquot for the champions now where the hell is my damn ring?
Biatch, celebration for nothing let you believe what you see 
I’m in the back but no frontin
7 days out the week I be working I’m full of hunger 
That jealousy is the smell of defeat 
Remember who told you
I’m gone 
Remember me when I’m gone 
[Hook 2: Dub-O]
When the time is up on my watch 
And they bury me in that box
Don’t say I ain't give this game everything that I got (everything that I got)
And when I die remember me like Pac, BANG! 13Embed"

Bumping a dollar and a dream, real shit
Every day I wake up, higher than the night before
Blacking out every night on tour
5 AM, we jumping in the pool in our drawers 'till the cops come
Run run, fuck the law
And I was born to be wild
Sex, rock and roll and weed piles
Running from the old and senile
Follow in my steps, then you walking a green mile
'Cause trees in my pockets like my denims a greenhouse
Leave my team? How?
Tell me what's my age again?
How many hours 'till I rage again?
This is the story of a young boy in the page we in
Say that he off chasing fame again
And there he goes; Almost famous, bitch

Hundred dollars worth of munchies, truckloads
Eighty-nine cent slushy in the cuphold
Don't know where I'm going but we gone - what's home?
Maybe I'll just Mapquest my dream, and it'll say the address was me
So what I really wanted all along's been camouflaged fatigued
I've been a pro, I just dodged the league
California dreams
Where we sitting up under the Cleveland weather, man
Wishing for heat, I guess I need to see the leather man
Uh, I just wanna be young forever man
Roll the Peter Pan, light it up and let's Neverland

I'm so tired of running, that I've worn my soles out
To the point that my toes is out
To the point that I can't look back
And even if I did I still couldn't see where I started out
Can't see home for miles
Lost like another orphan child
I’m only grinning cause I'm supposed to smile
So I do it for the ones that are down and out
Proud one of those is gonna be a spokesman now
But I'm still running, running, and I don't know where
All I got to my name is one pair
Of laced up chucks, five bucks, and a chip on my shoulder that's so big, that I cannot bare
I done lost my friends, family, and home for this
And for that I have lost my mind
Kept my faith, lost my direction
I'm just praying that I haven't lost my time
Go! (Go, go, go)

From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm goin'

Moving in the same direction wherever the wind is blowin'

And I'm so tired of strugglin'
I'm so tired of hustlin'
I can feel my heart fill with hate
I'm so tired of lovin'
I was supposed to be great
I'm so tired of duckin'
Tired to coming home from a job being fired from nothin'
And shit I'm tired
From the nights a muthafucker took that ride
To make that dream, come alive
To wake up in the morning to a nine to five
But I gotta do it if I wanna survive
Because in the city where I'm from it's either do or die
So choose it wise
Because you could lose it in the blink of an eye
But even in the darkest times
It's proven I- (I, I, I, I...)

From the bottom so up is the only place that I'm goin'

Voices in the wind telling me to come home

Scared that all this time I've been gone
I'll open up the door and my little daughter will be grown
And I'm cold, tell me why I'm so cold?
Probably cause a shoulder turns every night that I'm on the road
Probably why I can't smile every time that I'm on the phone
And why I'm acting so wild every time that I'm alone
Save me!
I suffocate myself beside the bed
Tryna cut the circulation of these thoughts inside my head, like
""Do I hate me? Or do I hate them?""
Either way I've held grudges since I was holding a pen
My father had me think that my cousin was dead
Just to hide me from the truth, how can I look at him again?
But this is life, and in life we learning to live
And when the past dies, this where it begins 'cause

Question, what if tomorrow never comes?
And everything you said today couldn't be undone?
Cause all it takes is a bullet from one gun

Just frowns cause I never seen a smile growing up
But you? You were a friend, always down growing up
Give the word, knew you would've blown trial growing up
Fuck! How could we let all this petty shit blind us?
How the fuck did we let the devil find us?
See, we were supposed to be best friends 'til the end, you promised
How'd it take that fucking night to remind us?
I only said I hated you cause you're the only one that's ever honest
Man I said I was wrong, let's get beyond this
But it's crazy, 'cause I never thought my text apologising
Would be the reason that you died driving

Ay, red light's on in the Boulevard
That means business
Throw up in this bitch, I might
Corny bitches make me sick
I might throw up in this bitch, throw up in this bitch
Gunna

[Verse 1]
Made man like Joe Pesci
I need Deniro or I'll Rob her
I had to skate Wayne Gretzky
Called an Uber helicopter
Bought a pound for the roster
Bought the yayo from Miguel, though
Award shelves need an Oscar
They need my merchandise on Melrose
David Bowie of my generation
Kill the Moët bottle with no hesitation
Came from public education
Ramen noodles with the bacon
I was working at Chipotle, I was finna have a baby
Went from stealing out of Walmart to president of operations
Dub was working at the steel shop
Slim was working off of 1st block
We still roll together every day
Except we might be on a private plane
Why would you ever come from nothing
And not do whatever the fuck you wanted?
They be asking why I'm such a legend
I took so much acid, I be forgetting
[Hook]
I'm a golden god, I'm a golden god
I'm on the roof of the party
Still almost famous, still all the way dangerous

[Verse 2]
Still dirty Chuck Taylors, still hanging with gangstas
The type to put the red beam on you, I ain't talkin' 'bout a laser
We the golden squad, we the golden squad
Double X, we the hardest
Me, Dub-O, Mercy Marty
Should've never got us started
Motherfucker, I'm retarded
Do you know how I'm regarded?
King of underground, King of Cleveland town
King of marijuana gardens
I can't stop myself from coughing
Four thousand dollar bong rip
Custom made for the new house
Can't believe I never had shit
2012 was a good year, 2017 too lit
20/20 vision, see the future
Looks like the crown do fit
I am king of this new shit, 7 rings and a pool stick
8 ball, and a suede robe – rockstars don't say no!
This beat so flame, though; I forgot to say my name, though
Bitch, I'm G-U-double N-A, Gunna!
Never like my mother, fighter, not a lover
Man, I'm wildin' every summer
I ain't like my daddy, he religious
I'm with bitches burning rubber
I'm a desperado, whiskey bottles, .38 bang, bang, bang
Models be on the same thang, thang

Alright

[Verse 1]
Why the fuck do I gotta remind everybody
When the time is finally mine
I've been killing rhymes for last ten years
Anybody interfere be clear, I'm here like-
I don't wanna have to be the one up in the office
That's slapping the bloggers like Straight Outta Compton
Baseball bats like a LA Dodger
I ain't finna play this year
Gotta upgrade this year
Get a payday and a AK for the nay says
In the race, like I feel a Tay-K this year
Got a big day this year
I ain't even the type to do it but Imma get a big chain this year
Just so everybody all the way in the back can see me whenever I get on the big stage this year
Go look at the speed on the dash and put it on the track
If you think I'm speaking too fast
I'm about to turn everything up until the speakers collapse
And make her ass ji-ji-jiggle like it's Khloé Kardash
I brought a beaker of hash
For everybody here that need to relax
And if it's beef I'm repeatin the past
Loose lips, get blood, like a bitch on a rag
I got drip like a leak in a bath, aye
[Bridge]
Forgot about you when you wasn't speakin' the facts on the podcast you got me
And you and me in the past
So, when I pass cards, then, I got to see ya the last
I'm kicking on your teeth to the come out of your ass
Not to mention that you girl is tryna to smash
So, I sent up dinner at seven told her meet me at [?]
Incredible that she blow me under the table
A lot of drink [?]


[Verse 2]
I ain't finna play this year
Gotta upgrade this year
Get a payday and a AK for the nay says

Got a big day this year
I ain't even the type to do it but Imma get a big chain this year
Just so everybody all the way in the back can see me whenever I get on the big stage this year
I've been on ten since ten
Solo like Kylo Ren (Kylo Ren)
Tokyo drift up that van
Pablo turned killa like Cam
Eating penne, pink sauce like Gotti
Young king on the throne like Joffrey
If I ain't top ten, no convo
Ay, bitch, it's Hotel Diablo

Tryna figure out my dreams
Cuz I don't really feel like dreaming anymore
Tryna figure out my dreams
Cuz I don't really feel like dreaming anymore
I can't even lie I want the diamonds and gold
Diamonds and gold, x16

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Uh, stories of a Prima donna
But when your broke that dream is common
Where I’m from we don’t see designer,
Where I’m from we just see dishonor
Where I’m from I don’t see my momma
That bitch left me like Halley's Comet
Can't look in my daddy's face
The street's came in and took his place
Sometimes I don't wanna wake up
Can't see past my bitches make-up
I heard that boy done sold his soul
For the price of them diamonds and gold

[Hook 2: Sean McGee]

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
It’s hard to dream when you ain't sleepin right
My fuckin nostrils look like poltergeists
 I miss going to rock at open mic's hoping that I got noticed by labels and blow up over night
Never happened but passion led me like Holy Christ
Good intentions just Breaking Bad like I’m Walter White,
I owe my life to my own advice
""follow your muthafuckin dreams until those visions come to life""
Till those diamonds glisten in the light, 
Remember they wouldn't listen to us right?
But I never had to sell my soul
To earn my right to these diamonds and gold

Everybody stay losin', that makes us champions

I came straight from sellin' nickel bags
Out my baby mama pad just to get a meal
Straight from puttin' Similac in a Walmart bag tryin' make a steal
Straight from burnin' 1 thousand CDs with my name on it
Opposite of what the game wanted, muhfucka we just tryin' get a mill
Now the Shaker grad boy signed to the Bad Boy
But I ain't gettin cheesecake, no this ain't Making of the Band homeboy
What is that my bitch? God damn she Colombian homeboy?
Ever since I got some bands homeboy, haters tryin' be my friends homeboy
Pull up in that tour bus everybody know what's going on in there
Backroom lotta panties droppin', lotta pretty bitches, pretty long hair
I'ma talk my shit, bitch I came into the game as rookie of the year
Blake Griffin, Kyrie, (who you talkin' 'bout?) Amar'e Stoudemire
Yeah and still couple people gotta problem with me at hater magazine
I mean Fader magazine, tell the journalist to suck what's in my saggin' jeans
Choke muhfucka, choke, none of my fans opened up your fuckin' magazine
Lucky I don't have Jermaine come up in your office and load up a fuckin'' magazine
Charlemagne don't like me, what's his name won't fight me
I'm a hype individual, God damn it, hypebeats hype me
Maybe cause I wasn't a good kid in a mad city like Kendrick
I was just a little bad motherfucker beggin landlords to be tenant
Beggin everyone to give my song a listen, tryin' get up out a shitty job position
Tryin' get a 24 karat gold toilet, 'cause I never had a pot to piss in
But it's ok I'm still maintaining
No, no, no
No fuck that, fuck maintaining
I'm tired of being humble
It time to let these industry muhfuckas know, man
I wake up and I see four MTV awards on my dresser that I got this year
I'm rollin' up Js as long as my fucking shoe on a gold plaque
Lace the fuck up!

And that was a dark depressing time for him, you know
He did had one visit with his mother I think
During the time that he lived with me and she brought
Him a huge box fill with gifts you know clothes and all
Kinds of little goodies and stuff and it sat in the corner
Untouched, literally for months he'd never opened anything just
Left the box there
[Verse]
What's going on in your mind when someone you haven't seen since you were nine is out at your door step right now?
Rewind, remember that one time when Marco showed up at the front door
And we found out he escaped from a psych ward and stole grandma's car?
Ah, rest her soul
I know that's off topic, but I miss her soul
So ironic that she was blind but told me I'm handsome I was
Every time that I walked in the door
Can't lie and say it was easy being 14 on February 14th
Watching a body die in my arms
Then have to go to a school that I hated
When my grade indicate that I don't give a fuck what's going on
A couple hours later on
And not to mention that one bitch that I loved
By the way, I call her ""bitch"" because she was
Wanted me to catch another man fucking her
Invited me over, told me to come into the front
Come upstairs and say what's up
And there she was, little slut
I was broken hearted, should've broke that bitch's jaw
Just for playin' me like a chump
But instead went to the garage, grabbed one
Of her brother's rifles, went outside
And shot that other mothafucka's truck up
I guess that's what lead me to cuffs
Becomin' common in my life like funerals was
Daddy's less common now, he gave up
After he heard the judge pin a fucking felony on his son
Funny enough, me and Aunt Barbara even closer
Start to feel some weight lift off her shoulder
Till it piled back on when a radiologist told her
That she had breast cancer and might not live much longer
Fast forward, the woman that I call my ""mother"" isn't my mother
Or even blood but that's how much I love her
And I'm feeling awkward cause the doorbell's from the person that I call HER
Maybe I ain't ready for it...
Shit, what should I wear?
Fuck that, I ain't going down there
I waited over a decade for closure
Why should I receive it if it might not be something I want to hear
In the mirror is a empty reflection
And in my head are questions I want to ask like, ""Where the fuck did you go?""
Why did you turn my birthdays to the worst days every year that you didn't show?
And if you must know, I didn't turn out to be much else
Than a drunk who fell face first to a pile of hell
Took four snuffs of the devil's dust
Ended up with my manager helping me 'cause I couldn't take a piss by myself
But I did get a record deal
And all my records got that making of a legend feel
And I did have a daughter who I promised that the way that way you made me felt
Is a way she will never feel
Slip a Benadryl in my cup
Ech, fuck it, I'm sickening up
Pit of my stomach clenching, all my muscles stiffening up
I ain't been this nervous since I got jumped
Flick the tip of my J over a surface covered with ashes and junk
Took a pull and sat it down, put on both of my Chucks
Reach for the door but my hand's sweaty, I'm anxious as fuck
Couldn't even hit the stairs without remembering how many years I was there waiting to see your car pull up
Now you saying she's right there?
Man you saying she's right there?
You telling me, if I open up this door right here
That she'll been standing right there?
And after all these years, am I wrong for having this fear
Of meeting the reflection that was missing in the mirror?
Open up the door and then I see her
*Opens door*8Embed"

Uh, from the bottom of the ash I rose
Yeah, to the top I go
Where I'm from its cold
But I don't need this coat (nah)
Keep my sleeves rolled
Got my city's area code on my shoulder (whattup)
216 forever in my soul
Swear to God every single night its gets colder
No heat so we all around that stove
Like ""fuck this broke shit"", petty ass hustlin
Couldn't even sell one zone
Slim still workin' at the store and the only time we ever get to eat is when he brings something home
Everydays dark here
Prayin for a rainbow to lead us to that pot of gold
And exchange those nights on a concrete floor
For a bottle of Rose to pop that bitch off like we suppose to
Never gave a fuck if we went gold
I just wanna be able to say that ""I made it""
'Cause real EST mufuckas don't fold
Real EST mufuckas don't break up, real family grows old
Real EST mufuckers representin' for the city where they came even when they gone
And fuck this throne, ain't no kings
No pretty princess, ain't no queen
No fairy tale endings on the eastside
Just these broken homes and those screams
Broken bones underneath these jeans
Broken bricks cover up my streets
Fiends outside trying to get they fix
While my first born in here trying to get sleep
Muthafuck this rap shit
Try buryin' your boy six feet, let me show you 'bout real
Try telling me that you can't make it up out the city 26 dollars to multi-mills
Face inside of the XXL
Then try coming back to the eastside still
Well bitch I did, and it's still the kid
Labeled a Bad Boy before this deal
What up Slim, Dub, Xplo, Dre, Swirv, Ash, my boy BK
And everybody from the beginning that bled with me knowing I would be here one day
So as I roll through all the hoods that raised me
Lookin' at the house of pain
I'ma runaway from the ones that pay me
Hopin I'll stay the same

I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there’s no one else to blame

Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small, and needy
Warm me up and breathe me

[Verse 1]
Uh, it's just me against the world
Lost my mistress and my girl
All they wanted was what's in my safe
And all I wanted was  just to be great
Contemplate, real or fake, all these people in my face
Wasn't ready for the fame, I flipped my shit and caught a case, Looking at my fans like I can't ball without a base
They understand, ride till the end
Now bow our heads and let us pray, Amen

[Interlude]
And after all these years of crime and malice
I look down and see I'm cold and calloused
And while our sins are to fifthly to bear
We have to wash them down, now grab your chalice
[Refrain]
And toast to those who always raised their glasses
When most never chose to go against the masses
So if you ride or die let me see them Ls
And I'll take you to a place where we can be ourselves

[Verse 2]
Look, Hollywood is not my type of party
Nah, look what happened to Chris Farley
Rest in peace him and Christopher Wallace, mo' money, mo' problems
And less people then when you started, shit
And you wonder why I don't drink coffee
I don't wanna wake up to these problems of a boss like John Gotti
I'd rather be Che Guevara mixed with a little bit of Marcus Garvey In hopes of a revolution as results of my anarchy
But I’m hardly ever home so I guess I'll be quick
Everybody wanna have their two cents: take it, here, I don't owe y'all shit
Smoke a zip, change my clothes and give my five-year-old a kiss
Family mad at my success, don't they say hate is where home is?
Damn
So it's just me against the world
Lost my mistress and my girl
All they wanted was what's in my safe
When all I wanted was  just to be great, Kells

[Interlude 2]
But greatness is in the eye of the beholder, so it starts with you. Believe in your own abilities the way you have believed in mine
It's time, put 'em up
[Refrain]
Let's toast to those who always raised their glasses
When most never chose to go against the masses
Now I know you ride or die, so let me see them Ls
And be proud you are not afraid to be yourself

[Verse 3]
If they want me come and get me, unload this clip till it's empty
And I ain't startled motherfucker
Do what ever I must to protect my brother
Respect no other, put no man above each other
This is what you live out when you trying to make it out the gutter
This is how you show that precious little baby girl you love her
This is how you step up as a man and get that bread and butter
But get by, all we do is get by
Ironic how we're lower class but always seem to get high
And the chronic seller is the man 'cause he got the supply
Get it? Demand and supply, make that spinach, get that Popeye
Sleep with one eye open, door closed
Bitch next to me, no clothes
Make songs feel like photos, I am hip-hop’s Andy Warhol
Yeah, so if they want me come and get me, and I'll unload this clip till it's empty32Embed"

I will not minimize the fact that you counted me out
Told all the bad news, and left all the good shit out

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
I don't gang bang, ho (Ho) I just gang bang these hoes
And I keep like eight J's rolled (Rolled) then I face 'em after my shows
And I got your main thing bro on my dang-a-lang where she swang and hang like an orangutan
But you don't really wanna follow me 'cuz every one of my boys bang-a-rang
Cocaine (Yeah), cocaine (Yeah), my skin white like cocaine (Yeah)
Marked up like them old trains but I keep it hood with this lo mein (Wassup?)
Propane, propane, spark that shit like propane
On the Eastside is my domain and I kick more shit than Liu Kang
Hold on, shut up, who remembers my come up?
Who remembers my broke ass when I had no food for my stomach?
Who remembers my haters when I was keeping it G? (I do)
'Cuz I don't remember them bitches but them hoes remember me
Hold about two phones, I don't call shit (Shit), Wild boy 'cuz I start shit (Shit)
Rager 'cuz I mosh pit and this ""a"" stands for ""anarchist"" (Yeah)
My heart is Antarctic, burn one and get car sick
Floating like a carpet bitch I'm higher than the starship (Let's go)
Tatted up so I can't work, you would think I got paid first
Beat that pussy out the frame, you would think that bitch gave birth (Yeah)
All these sins, you would think that I hate church
Said ""Thou shalt not steal"", but fuck that, I'll take her

Chea, it's the world, look

Fuck niggas, bitches too, all I see is these figures
I got Versace on, that Versace lights
I ain't seeing these niggas
Chances is, chances are, I raised three outta three of these niggas
Look, all bark, no bite
All rap, no white
But she wants her friends, to get with my friends, so we can be friends, well alright
Machine gun, we got one, machine gun I got one
See me, I'm a real nigga, probably mad at me cause he not one
Straight choppin' music, no bite
Eighteen dwarf niggas, Snow White
You can bet a nigga, if I said it nigga, ten out of ten, it's no white
Tell me what's not to love, why hate?
Want a real answer nigga, and I'll wait
Treat my 'rari like I'm in a roller derby
Put the shoes on and I skate
Say you don't like me, nigga, you know me, nigga?
See a sound of me, that’s hate
Say you wanna rap about it, wanna talk about it, and ain't live the shit, that's fake
Say it's coming back and this locking up sound like to me, that's flake
Say you don't rock with me, you don't fuck with me
Stay the fuck around me, that's great

Early morning cutting corners
Rolling up this marijuana
Stole it straight from California homie what do you got on it?
My cup holder filled with Tropicana
Couple grams of Aunt Jemima
In my hand like candid camera
Vibing to that Country Grammar
Pulling up to Grandma's 
I smell bacon, eggs thats scrambled
Hoppin out then ol' boy ran up
My dog grabbed the mc hammer
*blammer* *blammer*
Make him dance
And watch him run up out their sandals, 
But fuck all that, where's my sandwich
Let's blaze up and change the channels
Look on TV and I see me
With that Chief Wahoo on my beanie
""Wild Boy"" video on repeat
Only white boy on BET
EZ Widers + hydroponics
Roll one tall as Spike Lee
You ain't never seen a muthafucka do it like me
Kells
[Hook]
Oz. in my pocket, ducking the cops
Came from the bottom now I get high at the top
Oz. in my pocket, ducking the cops
Came from the bottom now I get high at the top

[Verse 2]
Rolling out, smoking up
Cleveland boys don’t give a fuck
1800 fill my cup
Being sober sucks
I'ma spend a hundred bucks on a Oz
Gotta call Big Chuck he the OG
And get a zone for the low cause I’m lil bro
Everybody on the Eastside know me
Westside get it cracking and the fact of the matter is 
Whether I’m standing on Denison Ave or I'm in the Valley
I’m bringing a Grammy back to the city this is the anthem
Have P. Diddy on St. Clair dancing
Kells
Used to ride the RTA
$1.50 every meter
Food wasn’t guaranteed I stole my meals out of Arabica
Speakers blasting my own shit
Bow tie on the jet on my grown shit
Court side at the game with the owner
And sell the same arena out when I’m homesick
God damn I'm a fool
Couple hundred diamonds in the tooth
Couple hundred bitches in the pool
And out of a couple hundred rappers I am the truth
That's why I get a couple hundred when I’m in the booth
Still I keep that
[Hook]
Oz. in my pocket, ducking the cops
Came from the bottom now I get high at the top
Oz. in my pocket, ducking the cops
Came from the bottom now I get high at the top

[Verse 3]
I come straight from the bottom
No hot water for showers
Stole a jacket from Target
Gotta go to court in two hours
I’m at Dub's house on Way St.,
Swooped up Slim off of Harvard
Drove down Dove to see Casie
Let's take it back where we started
When I had that
