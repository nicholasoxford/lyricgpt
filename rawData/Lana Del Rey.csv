I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child

[Chorus]
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?

[Verse 2]
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds

Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?

Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (""Louder!"")

Don't make me sad, don't make me cry

Keep making me laugh—let's go get high

Try to have fun in the meantime

Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain

Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not

Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known

Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off

You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been

[Pre-Chorus]
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man

[Verse 2]
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am
[Pre-Chorus]
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man (Yeah)

[Chorus]
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am

But I can't deny the way he holds my hand

But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul

Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town

And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?

I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on?"" He said, ""Yes"" (Yes, yes)

Tell me I'm your national anthem
(Booyah, baby, bow down, making me say wow now)
Tell me I'm your national anthem

Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes

Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss

[Verse 2]
I sing the national anthem while I'm standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
[Verse 3]
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon

But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind

I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times
I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me
[Song]

[Post-Song]
Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
""I believe in the kindness of strangers""
And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free80Embed"

Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer

With drippin' peaches, I'm camera-ready

Do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line

It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'

And that I've been dyin' for somethin' real

But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind

Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?

My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me

Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather

And falling for forever

Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you

For when you are crazy

Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight

Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive

There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""

We all look for heaven and we put love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it

Don't cry about him, don't cry about him

Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job

Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night

Yeah, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screamin', ""Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot""

Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why

Lay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Verse 2: Sean Lennon]
Hey, what you thinkin'? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinkin' on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine

Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
""Isn't life crazy?"", I said now that I'm singin' with Sean
Whoa
[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I could keep waitin' for you
In the spot we'd always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pourin' rain

Said, ""How the hell did you get there?""

Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from

She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, ""Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's of age""

You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy""

'Cause I met a man who

Said he'd come back every May
Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue

Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue

All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real

Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause

Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green

And now my blue banisters are green and grey, ah-ah

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck

[Pre-Chorus]
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had ’til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good

Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight‚ I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted

My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit‚ '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time

It's you‚ all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar

Run your hands over me like a Land Rover

All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me

Findin' my way to you, Arcadia

And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here

If you think that you know yourself, you can come over

So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town

Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute

Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night

And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time

I was at Coachella leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds

What about all these children and all their children's children?
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way

Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it sweet how we know that already?
Winter to spring
Spring back to fall
Isn't it cool how nothing here changes at all?

[Pre-Chorus]
You make me feel I'm invincible
Just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Not like before when I was burning at both ends

[Chorus]
We did it for fun, we did it for free
I did it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

[Verse 2]
Seasons may change
But we won't change
Isn't it strange how different we are from all of our friends?
Seasons will turn
The world, it will turn
The only thing we'll turn is the pages of all of the poems we burned
[Pre-Chorus]
Honey, you made me feel I'm invincible
It's just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Like I was before, no more burning at both ends

[Chorus]
Now I do it for fun, I do it for free
I do it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for the right reasons

[Bridge]
I remember watching How Green Was My Valley
Then I was thinking
""How deep was the canyon that you came from?""
Television static was quite overwhelming
Was it because of the cabin and the candles in the wind?

[Chorus]
We've done it for fun, we've done it for free
I showed up for you, you showed up for me
We did it for the right reasons
We did it for fun, we did it for free
[Outro]
When I was young 'til eternity
I'll do it for the right reasons
Withstanding all the time, changes, and seasons
