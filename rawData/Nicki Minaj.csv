Yo
I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked Drake
On my life, man, fuck's sake
If I did, I'd ménage with 'em
And let 'em eat my ass like a cupcake
My man full, he just ate
I don't duck nobody but tape
Yeah, that was a setup
For a punchline on duct tape
Wo-wo-wo-worried 'bout if my butt fake
Worry 'bout y'all niggas, us straight
Th-these girls are my sons
Jo-Jon & Kate Plus Eight
When I walk in, sit up straight
I don't give a fuck if I was late
Dinner with my man on a G5
Is my idea of a update
Hut-hut one, hut-hut two
Big titties, big butt too
Fu-fuck with them real niggas
Who don't tell niggas what they up to
Had to show bitches where the top is
Ri-ring finger where the rock is
The-these hoes couldn't test me
Even if their name was Pop Quiz
Bad bitches who I fuck with
Ma-ma-mad bitches we don't fuck with
I don't fuck with them chickens
Unless they last name is Cutlet
Let it soak in
Like seasoning
And tell them bitches blow me
Lance Stephenson
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, I never fucked Nicki 'cause she got a man
But when that's over, then I'm first in line
And the other day in her Maybach
I thought, ""Goddamn, this is the perfect time""
We had just come from that video
You know, L.A. traffic, how the city slow
She was sitting down on that big butt, but I was still staring at the titties though
Yeah, low-key or maybe high-key
I been peeped that you like me, you know?
Who the fuck you really wanna be with besides me?
I mean, it doesn't take much for us to do this shit quietly
I mean, she say I'm obsessed with thick women and I agree
Yeah, that's right, I like my girls BBW
Yeah, type that wanna suck you dry and then eat some lunch with you
Yeah, so thick that everybody else in the room is so uncomfortable
Ass on Houston Texas, but the face look just like Clair Huxtable
Oh! Yeah, you the man in the city when the mayor fuck with you
The NBA players fuck with you
The bad-ass bitches doing makeup and hair fuck with you, oh
That's 'cause I believe in something, I stand for it
And Nicki if you ever tryna fuck
Just give me the heads-up, so I can plan for it
Pinkprint
[Chorus: Chris Brown & Drake]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky (Ayy)
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only
I got my real niggas here by my side, only

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I never fucked Nick' and that's fucked up
If I did fuck, she'd be fucked up
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right
'Cause she act like she need dick in her life
That's another story, I'm no story-teller
I piss greatness, like goldish yellow
All my goons so overzealous
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca
Calendar say I got money for days
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she waved
They bet' not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade
Don't have my money? Take mothers instead
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin
I'm talkin' 'bout runnin' in houses with army guns
So think about your son and daughter rooms
Got two hoes with me, masked up, they got smaller guns
Ain't thinkin' 'bout your son and daughter rooms
This shit is crazy, my nigga
I mean brazy, my nigga
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga
Blood gang, take the ""b"" off behavior, my nigga
For reals, if you mouth off, I blow your face off
I mean ""pop-pop-pop,"" then I take off
Nigga, now you see me, nigga, now you don't
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles
Sixteen in a clip, one in the chamber
17 Ward bully with seventeen bullets
My story is how I went from ""poor me""
To ""please pour me a drink and celebrate with me""
[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil Wayne]
Raise every bottle and cup in the sky
Sparks in the air like the Fourth of July
Nothing but bad bitches in here tonight
Oh, if you lame and you know it, be quiet
Young Mula, baby!
Nothing but real niggas only, bad bitches only
Rich niggas only, independent bitches only
Boss niggas only, thick bitches only

R.I.P. to B.I.G. 
Classic shit

[Verse 1]
I'm lookin' for a nigga to give some babies
A handful of Weezy, sprinkle of Dave East
Man, I ain't got no type like Jxmmi and Swae Lees
But if he can't fuck three times a night, peace!
I tried to fuck 50 for a powerful hour
But all that nigga wanna do is talk Power for hours
B-beat the pussy up, make sure it's a K-O
Step your banks up like you're movin' that yayo
Somebody go and make sure Karrueche okay, though
I heard she think I'm tryna give the coochie to Quavo
They always wanna beat it up, goon up the pussy
Man, maybe I should let him autotune up the pussy
All these Bow Wow Challenge niggas lyin' and shit
Man, these Fetty Wap niggas stay eyein' my shit
Drake worth a hundred mill, he always buyin' me shit
But I don't know if the pussy wet or if he cryin' and shit
Meek still be in my DMs, I be havin' to duck him
""I used to pray for times like this"" face-ass when I fuck him
Man, Uzi is my baby, he ain't takin' a L
But he took it literally when I said ""Go to hell""
Used to fuck with Young Thug, I ain't addressin' this shit
C-caught him in my dressing room, stealin' dresses and shit
I used to give this nigga with a lisp tests and shit
How you want the pu-thy? Can't say your S's and shit, uh

[Verse 2]
I remember when I used to have a crush on Special Ed
Shoutout Desiigner 'cause he made it out of special ed
You wanna fuck me, you gotta give some special head
'Cause this pussy have these niggas on some special meds
Like Mike Tyson, he was bitin' my shit
Talkin' 'bout, ""Yo, why you got these niggas fightin' and shit?""
On the, on the real, I should make these niggas scrap for the pussy
Young M.A and Lady Luck, get the strap for this pussy, uh
And I woulda had Odell Beckham bangin' the cake
'Til I saw him hoppin' out of cars dancin' to Drake
I been a five-star bitch, man, word to Gotti
I'ma do that nigga Future dirty, word to Scottie
Had to cancel DJ Khaled, boy, we ain't speakin'
Ain't no fat nigga tellin' me what he ain't eatin'
YG and The Game with the hammer yellin', ""Gang! Gang!""
This ain’t what I meant when I said a gang bang
Tekashi want a ménage, I said ""tre-way""
Curved him and went the Kim and Kanye way
Em, cop the Barbie Dreamhouse, then you can play the part
I-I ain't tryna bust it open in a trailer park

And if he act like he know, I let him fuck it again
I got them bars, I'm indicted

We should all disappear right now
Look, you're gettin' all your friends and you're gettin' in the car
And you're comin' to the house, are we clear right now, huh?
You see the fleet of all the new things
Cop cars with the loose change
All white like I move things
Niggas see me rollin' and they mood change
Like a muhfucka
New flow, I got a dozen of 'em
I don't trust you, you a undercover
I could probably make some step-sisters fuck each other (Woo)

I ain't gotta compete with a single soul
I'm good with the ballpoint game, finger roll
Ask me how to do it, I don't tell a single soul
Pretty women, wassup? Is you here right now?
You a stand-up or is you in your chair right now?
Uhh, do you hear me? I can't let a wack nigga get near me
I might kiss the baddest bitch if you dare me
I ain't never need a man to take care of me

Cuddle buddies on the low, you ain't gotta tell your friend
That I eat it in the morning, cause she gon' say ""I know""
Can I hit it in the bathroom? Put your hands on the toilet
I'll put one leg on the tub, girl, this my new dance move
I just don't know what to call it
But, bitch, you dancing with the stars
I ain't nothin' like your last dude
What's his name? — Not important
I brought some cocaine if you snortin'
She became a vacuum, put it on my dick like carpet
Suck the white off, white chocolate

My anaconda don't, my anaconda don't
My anaconda don't want none unless you got buns, hun

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Was in shootouts with the law, but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me Alexander McQueen, he was keeping me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who wanna go first? I had them pushing daffodils
I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals
Come through and fuck him in my automobile
Let him eat it with his grills and he tellin' me to chill
And he telling me it's real, that he love my sex appeal
Say he don't like 'em boney, he want something he can grab
So I pulled up in the Jag, and I hit him with the jab like
Dun-d-d-dun-dun-d-d-dun-dun

Thi-this dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles
Di-dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's
Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle
Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil
Now that bang, bang, bang
I let him hit it 'cause he slang cocaine
He toss my salad like his name Romaine
And when we done, I make him buy me Balmain
I'm on some dumb shit

By the way, what he say?
He can tell I ain't missing no meals

He said he came from Jamaica, he owned a couple acres
A couple fake visas 'cause he never got his papers
Gave up on love, fucking with them heart breakers
But he was gettin' money with the movers and the shakers
He was mixed with a couple things, ball like a couple rings
Bricks in the condo and grams to Sing Sing
Left arm, baby mother tatted
Five year bid up north when they ratted
Anyway, I felt him, helped him, put him on lock, seat belt him
Took him out to Belgium, welcome
Bitches this pretty, that's seldom
This box better than the box he was held in
I'm Momma Dee in that order, I call him Daddy like daughters
He like it when I get drunk, but I like it when he be sober
That's top of the toppa, I never fuck with beginners
I let him play with my pussy then lick it off of his fingers
I'm in the zone

I got somethin' for you lookin'-ass niggas
Week and a half, I'ma be in that ass... pause
It's like I'm working on an album and a mixtape at the same motherfucking time!

[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her
I'ma save her, yes, like Danny Glover
I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother
I pass them a molly, now they kiss each other

[Hook: Young Thug]
Every time I fuck I gotta hit me least like two bitches
For that dope he whipped, you need a new wrists
Foreign car outside, that bitch got two digits
Money stand like eight feet just like two midgets

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Who the fuck told you
That Young Thugger Thugger don't fuck up the beat?
I got six cars and I also got rentals and all of 'em tinted
No, I'm not Nipsey, not from L.A., but I got keys to the city
I fuck it, I suck it, I beat it down, then she beat me to the ceilin'
Stoner my lifestyle, I'm livin' too wild
I came to make you proud, that money keep her around
In love with her head, I can't turn it down
Can't wait for my time to come back around
She see that you don't got Lil Haiti's style
Plus I just seen Snoop on Girls Gone Wild
I just bought a Bentley and a bitch came with it
Young rich nigga hittin' million dollar licks
Balling in New York like a motherfucking Knick
You better have them racks, you ever want to hear me spit
And everywhere I go I got a pass like the staff
I'm goin' off top like a motherfuckin' layup
357, six shots like Al
I left ten bands in a motherfuckin' cab
[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, cool, okay, bool, I love her

I'ma call my partner 'fore I fuck her mother

Every time I come out, I ain’t ever with no new bitches
These bitches is stealing, I'ma sue bitches
Dripping down his dick, this pussy too vicious (vicious)
Every time I fuck him, I say ""Whose is it?""
Yo! Who the fuck told 'em that, ""They was like Nicki? Oh no, bitches didn't!""
I'ma give bitches a minute of shine, then I'll tell 'em good riddance (good riddance)
To raise a child, it might take a village
But I wouldn't know, cause these bitches my sons
Yes, they was, and they still is
Gave him the kitten, now that nigga smitten
Told him to hop in my foreign, and then I said, ""No, I'm just kiddin'!""
Hell of a livin', you bitches on chitlins
When I come out of my mansion, I sprinkle some bread to the pigeons
B-b-b-b-but, bitches is lyin', they lyin', they lyin', they lie in they bio
So I ain't fuckin' with chickens unless I got pico de gallo
Girls is plottin', what more could they steal?
Tell Justin Timberlake, that I am comin' for Jessica Biel
Bitch, I'm a star-rah, you niggas, I holla tomorrow
Doors go up, 'cause I am too rich to cop a Gallardo
No regular doors, on Aventadors
Painted it pink, just so I could take pictures, while you rented yours
H-H-H-Hell of a ticket, h-h-h-h-hell of a price
I want it, I get it, I wire the money, I never think twice

Bitches wanna see a nigga thumb through it fast
I'ma name myself Young Thugga tenant

I don't like using profanity but the Young Thugger will cut you
All of my cups are muddy, I fuck my bitches' buddies
I just want nut like Buddy, all of my bitches buddies
Panamera with the tinted roof, all the niggas' dogs goin', ""Roof""
Top notch shawty, nigga ring came with karats
Young nigga rich, jewelry colder than the attic
If she ain't a virgin then that bitch is only average
I can't even hear ya, baby, get rid of the static
I can't learn a bitch, but I learned mathematics
I just ball her down whenever she call my pattern

You need a job, this ain't cuttin' it

I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fuckin' pencil for a frame
You don't like it, then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off
And I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering, ""Why, God?""
He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
The world ain't finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fuckin' face and called me a fuckin' tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
So I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod
The moral to the story is life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch, ask why not?
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, rah, rah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, they must've bumped your wagon
You must've went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Is this the thanks that I get for puttin' you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Should've sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'ma wrap your coffin with a bow
""Nicki, she's just mad 'cause you took the spot""
Word, that bitch mad 'cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shittin', then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear the mumblin', I hear the cacklin'
I got 'em scared, shook, panickin'
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfuckin' boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas gettin' buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levis
Raggedy Anns, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches callin' me Manning, Eli
Manning, Eli, these bitches callin' me Manning, Eli

[Verse 4: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it
No homo, but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You have the same passion I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids, but eyelash
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin' balcony
'Fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash
It's high class meets white trash

Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I been competin' since
I look beyond what people sayin' and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that, as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now, I'm takin' my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was '06
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, ""Yes, I suppose""

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go

[Chorus]
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it, then it's gone
While we keep waitin' for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
'Cause I'ma ride out wit' you, still, the night is young
And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you
[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask? Or am I just buggin'?
'Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties broken before me
Niggas tryna kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me
Yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I'll pop a pill and remember
The look in his eyes the last day he saw me

[Pre-Chorus]
All things go, all things go

And we keep goin', we go (We go, we go)
We wake back up and do it all again (And we know, we know)
Said, ""Fuck the world, we ridin' 'til the end""
When all is said and done, look what we've become (Oh, we go)
I just want you to know that I did it for you
[Verse 3]
Lemme make this clear: I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college just to say, ""We did it""
My child with Aaron woulda been sixteen any minute
So in some ways, I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel lookin' over him
And I know Jelani will always love me and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writin', this is The Pinkprint

What I tell them hoes? Bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to your knees
Young Money the mafia, that's word to Lil' Cease
I'm in the Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doing target practice, all these bitches just aiming to please
Shout out to the CEO, 500 Degreez
Shout out to the OVO, red wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year? We ain't get the memo
A young king, pay me in gold
40 got a bunch of weed he ain't even roll
These niggas be droppin' songs, they ain't even cold
Weezy on top, and that nigga ain't even home yet
Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki Nick gettin' married today
And all you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh
Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, party of five
Are we drinking a lil' more? I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear
Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryna make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies, but not everybody lives, ah
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive
I wish that I could have this moment for life, for life, for life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive, alive, alive

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
This is my moment
I waited all my
Life, I can tell it's time
Drifting away, I'm
One with the sunsets
I have become alive

All my powers back, now I'm scary to zombies
Bring the heat to her, sizzle, I ain't talking Kalonji

Abstaining from sex, had to zen my body

But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist and the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say ""love""
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, I don't ever say uh
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up

You said you was in love, and I still didn't budge
Cause I already seen how you be going in when you be in them clubs
(I'm not even sure if this is right but, it feels good)
I could tell you was analyzing me, I could tell you was criticizing me
I could tell you was fantasizing that you would come slide in me and confide in me
He could tell that I was wifey material
He was liking my style in my videos
I wasn't looking for love I was looking for a buzz
So at times I would lie and say I'm busy, yo
Cause it's too much, and it's too clutch
Who wants rumors of the two of us
But when you're away, I can't get you out of my mind
But what if I'm not the one and you're wasting your time?
But you waited

And we lookin' for some ballers, alopecia
I hate wack niggas, I should really slap niggas
These niggas trippin' when I put 'em on the map niggas

Ain't at no wedding but all my girls cake pop
Sleeping on me, no mattress though
I'm a burn the beat down, no matches though
No, they can’t keep up? They molasses slow

I feel like I'm King Kong, name still going ding-dong
It's two girls gettin' more money, and they don't rap, they sing songs
I stay with that pink on, pink furs and them pink thongs
Goons out if they blink wrong, think hard, but don't think long
Pink Friday had Eminem, spit hard but I'm feminine
Iconic trio on Monster, Goblins and Gremlins
What's left that I didn't do? You bit the forbidden fruit
You thought you'd get my spot? Who the fuck was kiddin' you?
Took a lil' break, but I'm back to me
Tryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?
They'll never toe to toe on a track with me
There'll never be another one after me
'Cause the skill level still just a half of me
Blasphemy, my niggas will blast for me
All these low IQ hoes baffle me
Tell 'em that I wash bitches take a bath for me
Bunch of trophies in my crib like a athlete
I see them giving fake love but that trash is weak
Man, you know that I ripped, every rapper beat
You know Nicki gon' eat, Bon Appétit

Hit you with the Ace of Spade in your face and shrugged
Blood drippin' out your arm on my Asian rugs
We was just plannin' a wedding, Caucasian doves
You was just tellin' your mans that you hate the clubs
Now we in the crying game, heart laced with slugs

Is it too late to talk? Did I wait too long?

Sayin' we don't miss each other, but it's all fictitious
Sayin' that we had enough, but enough of what?
Another slap to the face, another uppercut
I'm just abusive by nature, not 'cause I hate ya
Not 'cause I wanna get someone to imitate ya
I know it's hard, I know I intimidate ya
But is you stayin' or goin'?

How come you never show it? All this love you speak of

But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song
[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved

Tried to let you go, you come back 'round

Quack, quack to a duck and a chicken too
Put the hyena in a freakin' zoo
[Chorus]
Take your medication, Roman
Take a short vacation, Roman, you'll be okay
You need to know your station, Roman
Some alterations on your clothes and your brain
Take a little break, little break from your silencing
There's so much you can take, you can take
I know how bad you need a Roman holiday
Roman holiday, a Roman holiday

[Verse 2]
Bitch, twitch!
Bitch, motherfucking right, this is World War Six
This right here might make a bitch die
And this right here is gonna make a bitch cry
And if we being honest, I am such a great guy
And this what I do when a bitch breaks flock
[stuttering]
I'mma put her in a dungeon under, under
No them bitches ain't eating, they dying of hunger
Motherfucker, I me, who the fuck is this hoe?
And yes, maybe just a touch of Tourette's
Get my wigs, Terrence, go and get my beret

They want the outline, I give them a goatee
Goddamn, motherfucker, you talking about me?

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
It all comes down to this
I miss your morning kiss
I won't lie, I'm feeling it
You're gone now, and I'm missing it
I'm so dumb, I must admit
It's too much to hold it in
I can't say no more than this
I just hope your heart hear me now

[Pre-Chorus 1: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta let you know how I'm feeling
You own my heart, he just renting
Don't turn away, pay attention
I'm pouring out my heart, oh, boy

Let's meet at our favorite spot
You know the one
Right around the block from the nice place that you love to shop
Can you get away?
Girl, just sit down, let's talk it out
One-on-one, without a crowd
I wanna hold your hand, make you laugh again
I need to be near you

Other than that, I'm gettin' my Marc Jacobs on
Man, my pussy game so cold, that he always seem to come back
'Cause he know that it be a rap, when I'm ridin' it from the back
Wait, oh, let me see your phone 'cause all them bitches is ratchet
And don't let me get in my truck; 'cause all them bitches will catch it
Wait-we-we-we-we-we-wait, damn, there I go again
I be trippin', I be flippin', I be so belligerent
Man, the shit that we be fightin' over so irrelevant

And I'ma still ball, call me T.D. Jakes
Bars for years, niggas thought I did a bid
I'm draggin' these hoes like Harambe did the kid
Shut the club down, it was poppin' then we slid
I call my pussy liquor, I ain't talkin' 'bout a swig
But if you thirsty, I own a sangria

Ayo, I'm the one who run the city where they armed and vicious
Accusations on them blogs and they all fictitious
I done bent the realest blocks, pushed the hardest sixes
Keep a couple killers that don't care how far them licks is, look
Bitches act like they want action
Heard they want action
Bitch, we ain't duckin' no action
I'm 'bout to give them that traction, send a distraction
Then I'ma line 'еm like fractions
Took a break, I let 'еm live, look at all 'em eatin'
But these bitches gon' be mad once I call this meetin'
'Cause they gotta move around once the queen is queenin'
'Bout to put out all this crack 'cause my fiends is feenin', uh
I put these bitches on game, they should be kissin' my feet
I tried to give 'em some press, they tried to say it was beef
It's Nicki M, such a little gem
Bitches wanna be around me, but I do not fuck with them
All these diamonds on me flooded, I hope nobody gets stuck
If I pull out the Ferrari, then my shooters in the truck
I could still go to my hood, they know my body is good
Two million dollars to party in Saudi Arabian clubs
Poppin' them things to go up and smokin' Los Angeles bud
These bitches bitin' like Joe; shout out to Kamala, though (What up?)
It's them weak bars thinkin' that she dissin' for me
I graded your homework, bitch, it's incomplete
If you was tryna be my son, then mission complete
I'm the final level bitch they on a mission to beat
It's like COVID when the goat is on the track, the whole game stop
But I ain't playin' with these bitches, this ain't GameStop
If Barbie in the buildin', then she with a gangsta
He ain't gon' hesitate if I tell him to shank sumn
Just put a beauty parlor in my guest house
You mean the pink Lamborghini? That's at the next house
Fuck him so good, I got him walkin' with his chest out
I wish these bitches wanted more talent and less clout
I-I fall back, and just give them some space
'Cause when you already won, what the fuck is a race?
Look at them fuckin' for raps, oh, what a disgrace
I put that on A-rod, none of you bitches is safe (Uh)
Make his dick get hard soon as I brush up, but we tryna be subtle
Whole city go up when a bitch touch down like them niggas in a huddle
Sex game still cold, it's on igloo

They know that Nicki a poet, pop me a bottle of Moët
They said I couldn't, but I did it though
Tell 'em I still got that hourglass figure though
Can't stop me, don't watch me
You better just watch your nigga, ho, I'm in that big boy
I am in beast mode, respect the G-code
Bitches ain't got drive, these bitches will get repo'd
I am a monster, this is ambition
This the type of car, that you keep a bad bitch in
Not that I don't got good vision, but I don't see competition
They want me to come and help them, but I am not a magician
I'm on them fo-fours, I'm tippin', you better move out my way
I am not here to play, Pinkprint can't be delayed

You settle for less, yo, you disrespectful
You was special, the new you just dull
So cut all that bull, the nerve of me to come off my pedestal
Come off my pedestal, money off that edible
Which means them bags stacked high
You ain't got the drive, my nigga ya pedal stalled
You said you wept, aww, every day, a queen you slept on
And I ain't talkin' 'bout your mattresses
But um, you the type of player I press eject on
I can't believe you played for that long
I never re-respected nobody
I never needed you, you must've thought I did
I should have copped the stick, but I'm teflon
Pressed on, headstrong, sex the bomb
Dreams of a bad bitch tryna F a don
If his word bond and he wanna sex icons
If he bust down and don't wanna waste my time
Who the fuck you thought you was, tryna stunt on Nick?
Shoulda put you on blast like a gun on hip

This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now
This took dedication
This is medication, higher education
This the official, competitor elimination
I was taking trips, with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens, to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half like they flunked at math
Bitches ain't have cut up, crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This that: run and get a dollar for the ice-cream cone
'Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memory's only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers, niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Viola, Sharica
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha

Yeah, okay, we made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erykah
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga, either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, ""Money ain't a thang!""
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
'Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game
They know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rack
Wish you niggas good luck, tryna get where I'm at
Straight like that

Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah, I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah, she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?

My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermedy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac, little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan just one year to finish
My list look like this, first thing you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness

When I retire, tell 'em, ""Think pink""
Pink Friday is the imprint
And these bitches basic, instinct
Oh, shit, my commercial's on
Did I really body bitches with commercial songs?
Did I really prophesy everything I'd do?
But, before I continue, lemme thank my crew
So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
Tezz and E.I. told me it wouldn't be in vain
'Cause prior to me signing, I coulda went insane
And even now I think, ""Do I really want this fame?""

Everybody get quiet when I'm startin' the show
Man, I'm birthin' these artists and I'm startin' to show

And I just got the Ghost and I'm callin' it ""Casper""
But that shit is so cold, it belong in Alaska
Why the fuck am I stylin'? I competes with myself
When you went against Nicki, you depleted your wealth
And I'm not masturbatin', but I'm feelin' myself
Paparazzis is waitin', 'cause them pictures'll sell
Now don't you feel real stupid? Yeah, that's egg on yo' face
If you wasn't so ugly, I'd put my dick in yo' face

[Interlude]
Dick in your face
Put my dick in your face, yeah

Shake my head, yo, I'm mad, ain't a bitch in my zone
In the middle o' nowhere, I just feel so alone

Yo
Ayo, tonight is the night that I'ma get twisted
Myx Moscato and vodka, I'ma mix it
Roll that spaceship, we 'bout to get lifted
Live in the present, that gift is for the gifted
This what you came, this what you came for
You get what you buy, this what you paid for
So make sure the stars is what you aim for
Make mistakes though

So where them big boys with all of that? (Ayy)
Tell the bartender, say my order back (Ayy)
It's bottle service, he ordered that (Ayy)
Might let him take it home and slaughter that
He got friends for all of my friends
They ain't leavin' 'til we say when
And we gon' hangover the next day
But we will remember this day
So drop the pop and get low
And we could drop the top and just cruise
We fresh to death, down to the shoes
My only motto in life is ""Don't lose"" (Kyuh)

No ball, but peep game

Though he packin' that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chillin', make a hell of a killin'
Don't I stunt on these bitches?
Man, I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun, I'ma hunt 'em

Pull off in that thang, and it's blush red

Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then, after that, you know we gotta switch

We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money, go Oprah for me
All you girls don't like me, 'cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday

You spent your money but I ain't say I was your boo yet
You got your feelings hurt, I ain't really mean to do that
I'm just a bad bitch, I'm sorry I put you through that
I'm from New York where we’ll never say, ""Good morning""
Rippin' the block and he ain't come home 'til the morning
I always prayed to have a building with a doorman
Now I'm so busy I gotta turn down these endorsements
Now I'm flauntin' everything that I wanted
Remember a time when I couldn't even afford it
Now I'm in stores, I get everything that fits me
Chanel mink slides and shades so they don't know it's me

He gon' fuck around and drown off this wave
Pretty little toes, stunting on these hoes

Do it all the time, still I'm in my prime
Couple new blessings every time we pray

Uh, I'm still the same bitch from the city of the potholes
She say, ""Oh, I got those,"" I said, ""No, it's not those""
I don't fuck with birds, but you bitches on my cock though

Cooler than the winter but I heat up like the summer

I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
First you get her name, then you get her number

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Uhnn you want a freaky girl? Welcome to Nicki World
N-N-N-Nicki's world, N-N-N-Nicki's world
Um, let me think, what could I do to kick it off?
How bout I cum all on your dick and then I lick it off?
I mean it's something so funny when it get soft
I like to play with it, squeeze it like a stress ball
He say he like to hear the sound of me slurpin' it
Turn off his phone cause them hoes keep churpin' it
Tell me that I get the fattest pussy in the whole world
And if I let him eat it, I can be his ol' girl
Fuck I look like turning down some head?
I mean that's sorta like a bird turning down some bread?
You can eat it like a treat, you can squirt it, you can skeet, I'm a freak, I love to beat, just don't get none in my sheets
Every time I pop the coochie, Gucci start chokin' me
Now I'm kinda scared I got a feelin' Gucci stalkin' me
Sex game kinky, niggas call me Pinky
Fuck with presidents, I am Nicki Lewinsky

You ain't gon' wanna leave, it's like a kid at Disney World
My deep throat have you squirtin' like a water gun
Coochie overflowin' like somebody let the faucet run
Bust one nut, I ain't done, I got more to come
Friends tell 'em more to come, we gon have some orgy fun, Yeaaaah
Chew on me like some bubble gum
Might lick you like a lollipop once you taste my honey bun
It's our lil' secret, just like my underwear
You know pain is pleasure, can you make me shed a tear? Smack my ass, grab my neck, got em cummin' everywhere
I'm a freak so I don't care, just don't get none in my hair
Now he callin' me wifey and he wanna introduce me
Takin' me on shopping sprees he wanna buy me Gucci (Gucci)
Zoom like Boosie on the back of his Suzuki and I ain't even sex em'
All I did was let him eat my... coochie!

Go to the table and ask 'em do they want the flat or the seltzer?
I go where I want I'm good, my niggas'll get them goods
So come off the chain and come off the watch, you gotta respect the jux
Queen sleazy era and they never see me ever
'Cause I send my shooters and they introduce us as soon as I pull the lever (Brr)
I say ""Choke me,"" he do it every time that we do it

To show you our pockets are different (Ha)

She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' (Uh)
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children (Ahh, ahh)

Until I pop out with a million (I pop)

And make one of your partners come kill you (Yeah)

Did a couple DVDs, made a couple mistakes
Didn't know what I was doing, but I put on a cape
Now it's, ""Which world tour should I go on today?""
See, you told me I would lose, but I won
I might cop a million Jimmy Choos just for fun
'Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me, Australia, Sydney
Might run up in Disney, out in LA with Lindsay
Got the eye of the tiger, the Lion of Judah
Now it's me and my time, it's just me in my prime
Everything I tried to teach 'em, they gon' see it in time
Tell 'em bitches get a stick, I'm done leadin' the blind
Got two shows tonight, that's Brooklyn and Dallas
Then a private party at the Buckingham Palace
Which means I gotta fly like a movie, no commercial
That's Young Money, Cash Money, yeah, I'm Universal

Now I'm sitting at the closing, bought my mother a house

Micaiah and Jelani why I grind like I do
'Cause even when my daddy was on crack, I was crack
Now the whole album crack, you ain't gotta skip a track
I ain't gotta get a plaque, I ain't gotta get awards
I just walk up out the door, all the girls will applaud
All the girls will commend as long as they understand
That I'm fighting for the girls that never thought they could win
'Cause before they could begin, you told 'em it was the end
But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
Got two bones to pick, I'ma only choose one
You might get addressed on the second album
Which means you can breathe 'til I motherfucking say so
To all my bad bitches, I could see your halo

(Hard) I am (Hard), I'm still (Hard) the one to beat (Go hard)
Ain't in a rush for mainstream, I am the streets (Go hard)
I am getting it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Gotta go, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquee, everything sparkly (Man down)
Hit him on the walkie-talkie
Hit 'em, hit em, knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells, bitch, buzz me in (Bzzz)
And I only stop for pedestrians (Oh)
Or a real, real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the MAC, hit 'em with the TEC-nine
Hit 'em with the Ruger, by the intersect sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy, so my niggas call me Pammy
And I always keep the jammy
In the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borough on my back and I'm good
I don't wanna hear what you woulda, what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up (Uh)
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar (Oh)
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups (One, two)
Doing the scissor-leg, on the mat, with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin' LA Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin' President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a dilemma (Uh)
These birds all fly south in the winter (Uh)
Fuck I look like? Chomping on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle? (C'yeah)
I'ma be the queen, no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle (Yeah), Louis on the duffle (Yeah)
I'm a bad bitch, no muzzle
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Hahahahahaha, no muzzle)
What you wanna do, do, do? (C'yeah)
Bitches is softer than Al Dente
Cut from a different kente
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas wheelie-in' them Kawasakis
Shout out to the Vackee's, saltfish ackees
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin', kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed
Write my own raps, I gotta go, I gotta get me (Gotta get me)
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Yeah), ohh
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you could, you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', ""Nicki, leave me alone!""
(Hard) I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)
I am gettin' it in until the end
I gotta go (Go), go (Go), go (Oh)
Go hard

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
From slap-and-cry you start to die
So I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me
Just like Bobby know water
Better yet, like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit, put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown, don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm still nasty as a son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If you ain't got money, don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin' with me if you fuckin' with Nic'
They ain't fuckin' with me, they ain't fuckin' with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
'Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic
They wonder if he be fuckin' Nic, as long as she be fuckin' rich
That's why I keep my luggage 'cause I swear y'all a fuckin' trip
Young Money dungeon, bitch, my swagger just punchin' bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas, so call my gun ""Gunović""
Weezy F Baby and the 'F' is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust, yes, I love my country, bitch
Hahaha, yeah, guitar
[Guitar Solo: Lil Wayne]

[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Wish you could get rid of Young Money
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (To me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the chokehold on
Now they screamin', ""Nicki leave me alone""
(Hard) I am (Hard), I will (Hard), I gots to win (Go hard)
I'm still lookin' around for my competition (Go hard)

This is the autobiography of Nicki Maraj

[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)
(Can you hear me? Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Daddy was a crack fiend, two in the morning
Had us running down the block like a track team
When you burnt the house down and my mother was in it
How could I forget it? The pain is infinite
She's my Queen and I ain't even British, she's the only reason
That I went to school and I finished (yeah)
She told me that I had talent, got on her knees
And prayed for me when I started being violent (okay)
She saw something in me that 'til this day
I don't know if I could be that (yeah)
But I'ma die tryin' and when I'm done cryin' grab the iron
And black out like I'm retiring (kyuh)
Nightmares of you killing my mother
The reason that I sleep with my head under the covers
And they should've thrown a book at you
'Cause I hate you so much that it burn when I look at you
[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 2]
Damn, I wanna run to you, hold you and kiss you
And tell you how I miss you (I miss you baby)
Thought I would have a son for you but now it's official
It's over and I can't let you go (oh)
But I gotta let you know, all the shit I did made me feel like
I'm dying real slow
'Cause no one understands me
They don't know what to do when I'm hurt
And when I'm angry (kyuh)
You was my friend and my man and my daddy
You was there when that bitch tried to stab me
Anything I ever needed, knew you had me
'Cause of you, all them chicks couldn't stand me
So why I hurt you? That's the question
It took this long, for me to learn my lesson
'Cause now all I want is peace and get drama
Finally understand the true meaning of karma
[Hook: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic (I'll keep trying)
My voice projected, my life reflected (keep, keeping on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try)

[Verse 3]
Please baby, forgive me, mommy was young
Mommy was too busy tryna have fun
Now, I don't pat myself on the back for sending you back
'Cause God knows I was better than that (kyuh)
To conceive you, then leave you, the concept alone seems evil
I'm trapped in my conscience
I adhered to the nonsense, listened to people who told me
I wasn't ready for you
But how the – would they know what I was ready to do?
And of course, it wasn't your fault (no)
It's like I feel you the air, I hear you saying
""Mommy don't cry, can't you see I'm right here?"" (yes)
I gotta let you know what you mean to me
When I'm sleeping, I see you in my dreams with me
Wish I could touch your little face, or just hold your little hand
If it's part of God's plan maybe we can meet again

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj (Shawn Wright)]
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
My voice projected, my life reflected
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
(More, more, more, more, more, gotta keep – mo-o-o-o)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)
(The more I cry, the more I try, gotta keep on)

May the lord protect me, as the world gets hectic

I'm all about my wamables
Nigga ain't bangable
I'm all about my wamables
These bitches is flammable
Bad bitches in the colleges
Bust it open for me, gynecologist
But watch all your mileages
Pussy miles go up if you’re talented
I'm all about pool life
Thong in my ass, make that nigga drool like
I'm all about good sex
Fake niggas gotta pay, gotta book sex
Real niggas get the pussy off GP
Real niggas get a feature on my EP
What the fuck you smiling for?
And what they put you on the panel for?
Where you gettin' money from?
Ayo Twist, where you get that Bentley from?
Clap, clap, clap, make it go around like a lap
Now put it in my lap
Let me see your crack, like the trap

I like percocets, I like to keep 'em hidden in my Birkin bag
Ass so fat, damn I'mma hurt 'em bad
It's showtime bitch, tell me break a leg
Couple Bushwick niggas, that'll break your leg
Push you off the balcony, and don't break a ledge
Put your hand up, now it's time to make a pledge
You'll never catch me, in a lightskin nigga bed
I'ma always keep the hammer, nigga fuck a sledge
Fuck what they be talkin' bout, fuck what they allege
I know them bitches gon' hate on my Giuseppe wedge (check)
Box spring cost 25k bitch
I'm out in Cali, fuckin' wit' the black K-fed
And nah man, I ain't fuckin' with that Jean Vest
Playtime been over fuck a recess
Playtime been over fuck a seesaw
Bitches wanna play a game? Go and see Saw
That's one, that's two, and that's three four
I'm hungry, who else could I feast off?
You know my pockets fatter, than that little Vine kid
They couldn't stop me, even if the red sign did
Bitch don't get gassed, like a hybrid
These bitches thinkin' they can do what I did
These bitches thinkin' they can live where I live
But bi-bitches couldn't see me with an eyelid
I mean look, your bitch came off an island
I came in the game '09 wilin'
I'm out in Hollywood, left off Highland
These bitches loud, but when the Queen come? (silent...)

Mmm, oh
Mmm
Yo

[Verse 1]
Maybe you died 'cause everybody ask me where you at
I tried to channel you in hopes that I could steer you back
But it's like every intersection we just missed each other
You got your fans waitin', tell me you ain't six feet under
And tell me that you comin' back and you just took a break
Maybe I blamed you for everything, that was my mistake
In hindsight, I loved your rawness and I loved your edge
'Cause it was you who talked me down from jumpin' off the ledge
Your earings bamboo, your long nails too
Your BMW every time you came through
You was the brave heart, you stole Wayne heart
You never switched it up, you played the same part
But I needed to grow, and I needed to know
Were there some things inside of me that I needed to show?
So I just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

[Chorus]
You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you
But I am holdin' you, holdin' you, holdin' you
To that
[Verse 2]
Yo, did I chase the glitz and glamour, money, fame, and power?
'Cause if so, that will forever go down my lamest hour
I shoulda kept you with me, gettin' at them nameless cowards
They was no match for you, couldn't defeat your prowess
I had to make them changes, I hope you understood
You see, for every bad, I did a ton of good
But you was underground and I was mainstream
I live the life now that we would daydream
My only wish is you come enjoy it with me
Get on them conference calls, go meet the lawyers with me
The money came, yeah, I tripled and quadrupled it
But I still miss us when we was just on some stupid shit
And it's still fuck the media
They ridiculed you, never believed in ya
They just deaded you, left you in all black
But dear old Nicki, please call back

You told me you'd come when I needed you
And you said it so sweetly, I believed you
But I'm standing here calling, I can't see you

Meetings with the president of every network
That is what the fuck I call how to network
My net worth, that net works
Keep my shooters out in Brooklyn where the Nets work
Chillin' with executives
Check the charts, all my winnings are consecutive
Trillion dollar deficit
But y'all don't hear me though, all you bitches deaf as shit
Bitches ain't got punchlines or flow
I have both and an empire also
Sell out shows out in Norway, Oslo
This is The Re-Up, better cop it while the cost low
Flow's sick, I'll slap a patient
I'm checking these bitches like an application
'Cause these bitches trippin', no navigation
So it's off with your head, decapitation
S-s-send 'em up in flames like a fireman
I do the hiring and I do the firing
That boss shit that you talk, I live it
And I'm calling a travel if you don't stay on your pivot

Who the hell is this?
Calling me at 12:47 in the night
While I'm watching the fight
Looking at the phone, it's no name in sight
Blocked ID, knew something just wasn't right
It's my girl Kandi from out in Miami
Telling me that my man with some bitch in a Camry
Car seat in the back like he started a family
Yo Kan, stop playing, what the fuck is you saying?

[Kandi]
Remember them chicks from the Bricks 'round nine six
That we seen when we hit a lick by the project?

[Nicki Minaj]
Oh, you mean Leah, little sister Maria
I used to go see her in front of the pizzeria

[Kandi]
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some bitch that you knew from back when
Some bitch named Kim
Light skinned, slim, used to rock a low brim
Followed them to the crib, but the lights real dim
They hit me on the chirp, warning me, now I'm warning you
What's it gonna be Nicki, tell me what you wanna do
[Nicki Minaj]
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
Damn, I'mma have to send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker
I'mma send her to her maker

[Kandi]
They heard about his good sexing, long erections
Nice complexion, Magnums for protection
They even heard about his tongue game
How the nigga give brain, ain't stop 'til the cum came
But that's words of Hip Hop
I popped the bitch top, like a Corona

[Nicki Minaj]
Call a coroner, it's gonna be a lot of black dresses and chest vest-es
If I find out he got a next Mrs
What you think all the goons is for
Two by the door, a few more out in New York
And I feed 'em curry chicken, I'm all about my green nahmean?
Got some fat bitches in the kitchen
I got a spot like ox and we cook oxtail
Got a scale for what's in the mail
I got whatever on my nigga bail, But if the nigga bail
I'll have him sleeping with some killer whales
Damn bitches wanna fuck with my man
On the other hand, things ain't always what you plan
It's the ones up in your prom picture, salon wit'cha
Now they wanna creep in your man's jeep
I bet you Nicki won't sleep
Cause I'mma put the heat to your beak, You'll bird like tweet tweet
And watch you smoke like a cigarette
Should've left the bitch a pack of Nicorette
Leave all them foul bitches wet
I give a fuck about you and your bum crew

Holiday season

[Verse 1]
She said, ""Fuck Fendi"", but I think she was playin'
I heard she move them thangs, I think she fuckin' Wayne
She call herself Lewinsky, that means she give him brain
She tryna be like Lil' Kim; her picture looks the same
Why she ain't signed with G-Unit, she from Queens, right?
And what's her nationality? She Chinese, right?
I mean she okay, but she ain't all that
She ain't the next bitch, tell that bitch, fall back
See I'm a hater, I go hard, listen, let's begin
You know her last name Minaj? She a lesbian
And she ain't never comin' out, look at Currensy
But every time she do an interview, you know I run and see
She get me so sick, it make me vomit
That's why I spend my time online, leaving comments
And you know that I got some more haters with me
Might hit up ThisIs50
MTV, hit up BET, tell 'em pretty, pretty please don't play Nicki
[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi
One day you'll remember this, one day when we reminisce
Nothing I do ever is good enough for the music biz
Nothing I do is good enough for you

[Verse 2]
Bitches is like crabs in a bucket
You see a bad bitch gettin' shine, you should love it
'Cause every time a door opens, for me that means you
Just got a better opportunity, to do you
They don't understand, these labels look at numbers, it's statistics
I lose, you lose, ma, it's just logistics
Anyway, real bitches listen when I'm speakin'
'Cause if Nicki win, then all of y'all gettin' meetings
Ask L.A. Reid, ask Jay
Then hit up Universal, see what Sylvia Rhone say
Ask Craig Kallman, you can ask Chris
– Lighty, when you're done, just salute a bad bitch
Only underground bitch around that's ducking the paparazzi
In and outta town, be swervin' the Maserati
Stay around the white like a Nazi
Pussy p-p-popping on my poppers so the cops see, bitches
[Chorus]
Still I rise, still I fight, still I might crack a smile
Keep my eyes on the prize, see my haters, tell 'em hi (I'ma keep my eyes on the price, oh, oh)

Got my Mac Notebook with the Pro Tools

Keep a couple pink toes in my sandals
Got some bangles all over my ankles
Such a star, they singing the “Star Spangled
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-banner,” and I, I am the rap Hannah
Mo-Mon-Montana, so fix your antenna

If we in the Oval Office, then the lights out

And I keep a bad bitch on my GSX-R
But I leave her in a second for a thicker

Hook it up, I cook it up
And get some head while rolling blunts
Water paint, water stain
I'm lookin' down, she lookin' up
Beamer truck, I rim it up
Spent 80 thou', 400 stones
She suck a dick while rollin' blunt
She keep the boss man bustin' nuts
I get it off, she get it up
Me and her both can't get enough
We in the goat, I'm in the ghost
I'm tryna beat that pussy up
[Hook: Gucci Mane]

'Cause we pack shows, Celtics like Boston
You see me in the lobby, takin' pics and flossin'
After every pic gotta fix my corset
I am running this shit, I am so exhausted
Batter up bitches, but approach with caution
You be talkin' slick, and honestly I could see why
You don't know me and I ain't talkin' bout T.I
Just when they thought I was done for the winter, I
Came out stuntin', I'm such a big spender, I
Two of everything but nope I'm not a gemini
My life's a movie, take me to the cinema
Take me out to the ball game
Cause you know I only fuck with ballers
Yup them is my type of niggas, shotcallers
I been around the world, I'm such a bad, bad girl
I got the Austin Power flow, I'm groovy bitches
And no, you're no match for my Uzi bitches
I dumb my raps down so I don't lose these bitches
Say some sex shit like, ""wetter than jacuzzi bitches""

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, the mistress, I'm the baddest bitch
I'm the baddest bitch, trick, t-trick please I'm the baddest bitch
[Verse 2]
Half a bar,  just to laugh at 'em
High school, if he ball, throw my math at him
And if he wants some pussy, that's a no no
I only fuck with bad bitches, no homo
Flow sicker than LL
Chinese and them things go pow-pow
Word to me, all them girls better bow down
Nicki Minaj, I'm the talk of the town now

[Hook]
Been around the world, I still can't find
Another girl that could steal my shine
I've had my highs, I've had my lows
But you can't tell me that I am not the baddest bitch

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Tom-Toms like in Lebanon, hotter than in Pakistan
Click click click, Young Nick', the atomic bomb
Yeah, see it then you lick your tongue (haha!)
Bet that it tastes good, get you some
Wicked, got ten bad bitches
We sh-sh-shut it (down!) like the club got glitches, dig it?
And while you do that, GT's pullin up
Yeah, spaceship, E.T.'s in the cut, yeah
P-pop a bottle, just to get my head right
Tell the doctor, go and get my meds right
Monster, you know it wouldn't be proper
If we didn't return with a big rocket launcher

[Hook: Sean Garrett]
Massive attack, massive attack

Bet the DJ gon' bring this one back, ayy
Like the swagger bomb bring on this track, ayy

Never find me in the club laid back
I wanna jump to this jam all night 'til we see the sun
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
So, so hot in here, feels like a jungle (Yeah!)
Me don't like boys that ain't jumbo (Yeah!)
One time, bust a shot for my champion girls
Tell them guys super-size me a combo
Kn-kn-know I got the ammo, that's why I bulletproofed the Lambo
In the Middle East on a camel
Runnin' through the jungle, (Rambo!), Liberace (tango!)
Swingin on the vine, mango (Mango?)
So call me Simba, little mama, cause Mufasa couldn't stop a bitch
I fly in on that chopper, just to buy Balenciaga
It's just me, Mr. Miyagi, and the Phantom of the Opera
Goin' blaka motherfucker
Got that big, rocket launcher!

Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?
I swear, sometimes, it feel like it nurtures me
But to keep it all real, it's kinda hurtin' me
I could say I'm done with it, but it lurks in me
So I'ma just tell myself that it works for me
Take a real long drive in the Mercedes
And I might pop a couple of them Percoce's
Yeah, that'll make me transform to Hercules

[Pre-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah

[Chorus]
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am
Here I am, here I am
So take me as I am

[Post-Chorus]
I am who I am
Ah
[Verse 2]
I swear to God, man, everything in life is old
And the only thing that changed is the price of gold
Even in the afterlife, I'ma fight your soul
'Cause the second time around, I'll be twice as bold
So do you take me to be who I am?
To have and to hold 'til death do us part?
'Cause if not, it's just best we both part
'Cause how am I supposed to finish what you start?
You got me thinkin' twice to just breathe (I am)
Then you say I won't survive if I leave (Who I am)
But I got a couple of tricks up my sleeve (Ah)
I no longer need your attention, at ease

[Bridge]
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
Now it's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar
It's a joke, it's a game
Why am I still keeping score?
I'm in pain, I'm ashamed
I'm a woman, hear me roar (Here I am)
