[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
[Bridge]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Chorus]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you

Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

Can't take back the love that I gave you

I admit it, another ho got me finished
Broke my heart, oh, no, you didn't
Fuck sippin', I'ma down a whole bottle
Hard liquor, hard truth, can't swallow
Need a bartender, put me out my sorrow
Wake up the next day in the Monte Carlo
With a new woman, tell me she from Colorado
And she love women, she'll be gone by tomorrow
Who am I kiddin'?
All this jealousy and agony that I sit in
I'm a jealous boy, really feel like John Lennon
I just want real love, guess it's been a minute
Pissed off from the way that I don't fit in (I don't fit in)
Tell me, what's the secret to love? I don't get it
Feel like I be runnin' a race I'm not winnin'
Ran into the devil today and she grinnin'

Ten minutes, she told me it would take ten minutes
To break my heart, oh, no, she didn't
Fuck livin', I'ma drown in my sorrow
Fuck givin', I'ma take, not borrow
And I'm still sinnin', I'm still losin' my mind
I know I been trippin', I'm still wastin' my time
All the time given, am I dyin'? Am I livin'?
It's fuck feelings, my sorrow go up to the ceilin'

You used my past and my memories as a weapon

I cry out for help, do they listen?
I'ma be alone until it's finished

Now I'm running from her love, I'm not fast (Fast)
So I'm making it worse (Making it worse)

I'm a whole different person (I'm a whole different person)
It's a gift and a curse (It's a gift and a curse)
But I cannot reverse it

[Verse 1]
I can't reverse it
It was a gift and a curse
And now I'm drinkin' too much, so I'ma talk with a slur
Last time I saw you, it ended in a blur
I woke up in a hearse
You said, ""You loved me first"" (First)
One thing my dad told me was, ""Never let your woman know when you're insecure""
So I put Gucci on the fur
And I put my wrist on iceberg
One thing my heart tells me is
""Flex on a ho every time they're insecure""
I guess you came through, I'm running from you
Is your love for real? (For real? For real?)
Is your love really true?

She told me put my heart in the bag (In the bag)
And nobody gets hurt (Hurt)

I really hate the runaround
You really got me paranoid
I always keep a gun around
You always give me butterflies
When you come around
When you come around
When you come around

[Verse 2]
You let me know love is not the answer
Not the answer, not the answer
I love to do drugs, so mind my manners
I get high when you don't decide to answer
Phone home, I need to phone home
I'm throwing rocks at your window, I need to go home
I don't wanna leave
I just wanna be with you

Numb the pain with Oxy and Dior, yeah, pricey

They tell me the death of me gon' be the Perkys
I know they laced pills, I bought them on purpose
Life's unreal when death's uncertain
It's funny how the blessed ones had the most curses
Heart falling to the floor if we lose another person
Take three more, I swear it's worth it
But it ain't no world tour if I'm laying in a hearse
I remember losing lil' bro, he laying in the dirt
Now I'm bound to drop a tear or two on every single verse
Good terms, bad terms, when they die, it's the worst
Sometimes when I'm high, I feel high in reverse
I ain't going out like that, you fuck with me, you get the work
You ain't gon' see me in no wooden box, I'm gonna shoot 'em first
I promise y'all I'm finna touch the world, yeah, I'ma touch the Earth
But hold on, your girl on my line, I think I may just fuck her first

Turned around and faced my fears
I haven't felt this low in years
We die in three like musketeers
Ain't too many real niggas left in here

Smoking loud pack, what you say? I can't hear

Why, why do we live to die, die?

Father forgive me, for you know that I'm always sinning

Excuse my language that's a hang up on how shitty I been feeling

I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
I'm not sure
(Yeah, I like that)
Uh

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 1]
I've been through the wringer
Tryna put a diamond ring on her finger
She love drama, she be watching Jerry Springer
Next thing you know, we all on Jerry Springer
I play love games, but no, I'm not a cheater
She hate it when I sip codeine, I'm a leaner
The devil on my shoulder keep on telling me to keep her
Should I take her out or should I take her to the cleaner?
Love don't end good for me, no good for me
She's good for me, too good
These hoes love playing me, heartbreaking me
Don't pray for me, just give me drugs (Bring me drugs)
[Bridge]
Just give me drugs
Just bring me drugs
Just give me drugs

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure

My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur
Baby, you jump first
It's a long way to hell, I ain't really tryna leave this Earth
Baby, do your worst
I've come to the conclusion you can't kill me if I kill you first

[Verse 2]
I told her, ""Run around and get away""
I think I need a getaway
I need to call a timeout, I need to set another play
I need a umbrella 'cause every day feel like a rainy day
I need something other than Xannies to take the pain away
I ran away to California, I'm tryna cut corners
Satan bossin' me around, but you know I don't take orders
Yeah, I had to move around, I was startin' to feel cornered
Startin' to feel cornered, I can't see the front door
Startin' to feel cornered, startin' to feel slaughtered
Started to not give a fuck, screamin' out, ""Why bother?""
My ex-bitch too bad, my next bitch way hotter
We met in a car crash, she ride it like full throttle
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm not sure
I don't know if it's because my heart hurts or if I'm insecure
Baby, you're not her
My last girl had me so fucked up, it was a blacked out blur

Uh, uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, uh (Daytrip took it to ten, hey)

[Verse 1]
Swallow all these pills with my pride (Uh)
Married to my highs, you may kiss the bride
Trouble in my brain, see it in my eyes
I got voices in my head, they keep me up at night
Said I was okay, but I'm lying, feel like that I'm dying
Soul screaming and crying, feel my brain frying
Try to numb the pain, all the drugs I've been buying
This oxy gettin' pricey, pour the codeine in the Hi-C
Blood red blend in the Hi-C
I've been doing so much wrong, even though ma told me to do the right thing
Poppin' pills all night long, in the studio pourin' out my feelings
Can't explain this feeling
Kinda feels like I'm losing even though I'm winning

Drain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories)
Drain out bad energy (Drain out bad energy)
Forget the bad memories (Forget the bad memories, ayy, ayy)

Multi-million dollars
All mine from the start
Codeine kills the drama
And the trauma in my heart
Just got a call from the dark side
Stab wounds in my chest, but I'm alright
I miss my friends, I hate this spotlight
I love my girl, I hate the thot life
Yellow diamonds, shiny pearls
I'm tryna give her the world
I'm tryna show her the world
She ain't no ordinary girl
I know she know, I know she know I'm down and out
Life is a ocean, demons I've been drownin' out
I watch the crowd and crack a smile
I have a job to lead them out

Got my name in they mouth like they swallowin' my children
I never got why niggas hate
It's probably 'cause I'm doin' better than them, anyway
It's probably 'cause I get they bitches wetter, anyway
It's probably 'cause I'm livin' and they're in a lower place
They're walkin' in their sorrows, while I'm vibin' out in space
Crash land just to take they girl on a dinner date
When haters see me winnin' they just hyperventilate
They always try to stop me, but I never hesitate
Just follow all your dreams and when you reach them, celebrate
That's the only way to truly make a hater suffocate

Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days

[Verse 1]
Chip, chip, cheerio, everything's all good, right?
I got rich, I got rich, I'm livin' that fast life
Couple M's in my bank account, I got cash, right?
And that's supposed to make me happy
I got a couple questions
How come that shit don't ever make me happy?
Money give me an erection
But that don't mean it's gon' be everlasting
Yeah, I know it's a blessing
But how come it always feel like the devil plottin'
And the devil watchin'?
He see me buyin' all these watches
Benjamin Franklin in my pockets
Ooh, been a year of the glitz and the glam
And the TV channels, brain's going scramble
Scrambling sometimes 'cause this shit is hard to handle
Demons in my heart (Yeah), they destroy me like a vandal (Ah)

Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up

[Chorus]
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days

[Verse 2]
Karma ain't what you think it is
Super stressed, still handle all of my business
Do the best I can, yes, I can
Yes, I am, misfortune
I know in the dark, they be lurking (Why?)
Same way they lurk in your head when they get in your mind
You don't wanna know what they're tryin' to find
I'll protect your soul (Ah)
[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand
Don't give up
Take my hand
Don't give up

[Chorus]
Yeah, I run away
In fear of me dying today, ah
And I'm not the same
Who said I was subject to change?
My demons are breakin' out of their cage
I'm praying that I see another day (Chill, chill)
I said my demons are breakin' out of their cage
On my knees, I pray for better days47Embed"

Huh, uh

Percs give me a feeling, I feel it (Man, goddamn)
Like the Black Eyed Peas

[Chorus]
I got a feeling
Percs help me feel it, I feel it, uh
Problems, I numb and conceal them
Kinda like my feelings, but I still feel them
I just walked in the building
Look like a million, but I'm worth more than a million
I don't need no Ritalin, I'm focused on the millions
Disregard civilians
Until I get a house with a moat and a pavilion

[Verse 1]
I reek of good vibes
Smokin' on reefer, I'm high
Percocet fever
The type of pill to make you scratch until your nails gone (Yeah, yeah)
Drugs in my head, you heard what I said
No five, no ten, no fifteen, twenty, just Perc-30's in my meds
I told my mama I'm here to stay, no, she won't catch me dead
I'm too much of an idol, nigga, no Ryan Seacrest
Do it by my V-lone, 'lone

Alone, alone, alone (Slatt)

Just got a new house, gotta hide the skeletons in the closet
And keep 'em there, really tryna forget about 'em
They tell me God watchin' over me, I don't doubt it
But I can see Him gettin' tired of me sinnin' and wildin'
Don't know what to do with myself these days

But all this money don't rid me of my pain
But everywhere I go, I could make it precipitate, rain

Off the top, kickin' it, no karate class
Janitor, I'll mop his ass up, chop his ass up
I'm the best at what I do, can't nobody do it better
Your girl a sprinkler system from the way I get her wetter
Uh, I'm out the jam like jelly
I'ma go hard, catch a shot like Belly
I'm the best to ever do it, have 'em leakin' body fluids
Feel like Waka Flocka, ""O Let's Do It"" when I'm on this music
Off the dome when I'm kickin' it
Kinda like I got a impediment when I'm spittin' it
I been rippin' writtens without writin' a damn thing
I'm doin' my damn thing, I rap and I sing
I ring like bells, king
That's me, you better king me
I'm married to the money, fuck it, need to buy a ring, b
I pull up on the scene, choppa get to fuckin' ringing
Like a joke or something, choppa get to zinging, aha
Man this shit look easy, on my grind like Trukfit, no Lil Weezy
Your bitch too sleazy, .40 bless you, sneezin', uh
I'm the best to ever do it, take yo' breath away, you not breathin', uh
Breaking Bad method how I sell this meth
Retrospect, put that shit back in retrospect
Take your specs, take your bitch, grab her breast, tat her chest
I'm the best to ever do it, I'ma say that again
Lord forgive me on this mic, 'cause I know I'm finna sin
Killin' him, him, and him, referencin' Eminem
All these other rappers ain't shit but feminine, and
I don't really got time for it
They can have a penny 'cause I don't really got a dime for it
Catch me rockin' Tom Ford and some Air Forces
With a passport and a black torch
Comin' up the full court, pressed like Kobe or somethin'
Super clutch in the fourth like Ginobili or somethin'
You say you ballin' like you Jordan, nigga, nah, you frontin'
Run up on me, that's okay, that choppa on me get to jumpin' like Jumpman
.23 in that glizzy, come and get it
I been defyin' niggas like science and physics
You run up on me, I hit 'em
That choppa on me like a tongue, I pull it out and it lick 'em
I'ma shoot him 'til he done, uh
I got all the girls sprung, pull up on the scene like a ""he hung""
I'm of the best to ever do it, say that again

I don't got to write shit, I see it like a psychic
Your girl like a Huffy commercial, she ride like bikes, kid
I'm the best to ever do it, yeah, I said it, huh, and I meant it
Listen to my lyrics, man, I vibe on this bitch
Roll a blunt up, a OG, and get high on this bitch
Mix it with the pills and liquor, I may die on this bitch
Did I do that shit on purpose? Suicide in that bitch, huh
Suicide doors with a suicide whore
Drivin' off a bridge, I call that a suicide Porsche, haha
Ooh, we kickin' it, man, look
I pull up in a four-door flippin' like parkour
Fuck your bitch on camera and call that shit a hardcore
Hard porn, sharper than harpoons
I come through with three bullets in my face, that's a war room
Animated like cartoons when I'm off the shrooms
Niggas dirty so that choppa actin' like brooms, uh
Niggas salty like Spongebob and spittoon, uh
Pull up on the scene, huh, that's just me, uh
Hey, switch that shit up real quick, uh-huh
I may come back to that, I don't know

Uh-huh, I was just talkin' about how I like Tyler and that nigga Cole
Uh, I'ma, uh

Run up on me, you get popped
Catch the shot out the Glock, I'm the Juice, word to Pac
Run up on me, pop your top, matter of fact, better back up
'Cause I'm in the back of the truck, with the MAC tucked
Tell that nigga condiment or somethin', he need to catch up
He can't catch us, them niggas can't back us, huh
Man, them niggas need some backup
I'm on the scene, boolin' with my bros
Like I'm Drake with the 6, runnin' through it with my woes
Run up on me like Shaquille, in the paint I'm throwin' bows
You a ballerina 'cause I keep you on your toes
Shout out to them Florida niggas, I know some zoes
Run up, that's okay, I'm finna let the choppa blow
I'm on Westwood, ridin' through your hood
Like Red Ridin', strikin' like bright lightnin', my flow is too excitin'
I'll end your world like Mayans, off the dome, kickin' it
Try me if you think I'm lyin', man, listen how I do it
I get brain from a smart bitch but she stupid
Put an arrow through your heart, but no, I'm not Cupid
Make you shuffle when I shoot, but no, it's not Cupid
The wordplay is so cold, my heart is so gone
Yo bitch is so sprung, yeah, I put the team on
She gon' give the whole team head, call that a crew neck
But I'm wearin' a sweater, I'ma get her wetter, uh
I'm the best to ever do it, I'll say that shit forever
No matter the weather, knock 'em out like Floyd Mayweather
I'm off the dome kickin' it, that's just how it is
I'm Khalifa with the reefer but I never been a wiz
Tricks are for grownups, they said they were for kids
Hell nah, 'cause you will get popped off like a zit
If you fuckin' with my money cuz, I'm all about a grip
Tell your bitch to swallow kids and I'll tell you to swallow clips
Rest in piss, rest in this, matter of fact, I'ma go hard
Spit crack like Bobby Brown and grill 'em like Bogarts
Stomp the yard like Chris Brown like he got shot in the movie
I'm hotter than white bitches chillin' in a jacuzzi
My money got longer, shout out to Uzi
I'm in the scene with a nina, you run up, I'm shootin'
I swear that you don't want no problems with me, it's over with
Call me everything but sober, I am not with that sober shit
It's a union with my gang, come around like a Soviet
Matter of fact, I'm finna gamble for this shit, where your poker chips?
If you run up, you'll, you'll get cranked like Soulja did
I'ma drop bars same way I drop bombs
You ain't on shit, ww-dot-com
I forgot a W, I took that out, 'cause that W stand for ""Win""
I never took the losin' route, I always took the losers out
Eeny meeny miney moe, I always pick the choosers out
She got titties, when she come around I pick the hooters out
Run up on me, that's okay, they beefin' on computers now?
I'm not worried about these niggas, keep a .30 on my hip
I Steph Curry about these niggas
These niggas hella soft, man I worry about these niggas
I never run away, I don't flurry away from niggas
That nigga lil' pussy, he furry, ain't he, lil' nigga?
Pull up on the scene, you know I'm with it
My windows tinted, pulled up clean with a ""Stop, you're finished""
You know we dig it
I'm ballin' like Dennis Rodman, I'm fuckin' awesome
I'm bombin' like atomic, my eyes are redder than demonic
I'm faster than Sonic, I'm faster, withdrawals got me fastin'
My stomach movin' slow like molasses
I got it, run up on me, I'm poppin'
Feel like Drake when I'm rappin' 'cause I start from the bottom
All this shit that I'm talkin', I could probably back it up
I slide into your bitch DM like a sled and toboggan
For your brains I may bargain, I caught you lackin' at Target
I'll turn your ass to a target then threw your ass in the garbage
Run up on me, it's nothing, I swear to God that I'm bussin'
Like a Proactiv commercial or somethin', haha
These niggas makin' assumptions, me, I'm just makin' this money, huh
I wear Givenchy, you still in Abercrombie, you see the difference?
Broke niggas and rich niggas, showin' the distance
This is a business relationship, fuck a friendship
All these other niggas fake like, ""What you got over there?
Let me get something off your plate,"" nah
I did this by myself so I don't need nobody help
Shit, I'm a giant, you an elf, I put your brains up on a shelf after I collect it
Matter of fact, my mind is my weapon
Slide through your block again and catch some sloppy seconds
That's a preference, I heard you like talkin' about Heaven
Well I send your ass to hell, right next to Jezebel, uh, huh
You can catch twenty shells, you a fat pussy, you get shot, Garfield
I got bars like jail barbells, these niggas not funny, huh, Seinfeld, aha
But my flow is so unpredictable
Fuckin' with me is like steppin' in a minefield
Man, I could never mess up, I gotta 'fess up, this is a confession
I pull up on the scene with my .40, it came from my plaster
That shit's a blessin', huh, I leave you in the past tense
I wrap the rap in plastics, that's just some plaster rap
But I'm still the realest rapper after the fact, huh, can you imagine that?
Man, these niggas sick to hell, Johnson couldn't magic that
Man, this rappin' shit is such a passion
Not a father when I did it so I'm callin' me a bastard
And these niggas talkin' dumb to me
But that shit doesn't matter, 'cause my pockets gettin' fatter
And I'm climbin' like a ladder, outer space, I'm up on Saturn
With some niggas that came from my hometown
They really rowdy, you run up, that's okay
I swear to God we get to growlin' and bouncin' and pouncin'
You gon' need a bouncer, we robbin' your accountant for everything
So much money that I ain't even count yet
Life's a bitch, why is mine keep playin' farfetched?
These niggas ain't locked up, haven't seen bars yet
My gun singin' like Barbra, guess, Streisand
I got a knife in my right hand, your bitch in my left hand
Her meth in my back pocket, I'll give it to her in a second
If she keep jockin', I'll rip your eyes out of your head
If you keep watchin', I am the best rapper in here
The best rapper over there, the best rapper everywhere
I can say what I want and it come out how I want it
Run up if you want, that's okay 'cause it's over
I really do not condone it, I don't fuck with opponents
It's commas, no exponents, but these bullets come in three
And they be singin' like Jonas, I don't really got no smoke
But if you want it I got it, I pull it out and I pop it
I send some shots at your noggin, I remember rockin' Robins
Back at the bottom, now it's Givenchy and Gucci
All over my pair of pockets, man, maybe I should stop it
Let's keep goin' man, I'm just feelin' nauseous
Off the Henny, that's the remedy
A hundred in these clips, so if I shoot it that's a centipede
I stick it on the Lamborghini, drivin' like a century
It's twenty-one inside this clip, huh, like the century, I'm schoolin' niggas
Ruler in the Glock, elementary, I'm in her mouth like a dentist
She made me replenish, I'm ballin' like I'm Dennis
Rodman, rotten, plottin', freestyle, no jottin', I got it
Man, I could rap forever
If I go broke, Westwood, I'ma prolly trap forever
So cold I could go to Siberia and trap the weather
I could trap in Siberia, I could trap wherever
Man, rainy weather, sunny weather, either way, it goes
My gun with me 'cause let's go, ooh
Next beat, next beat, I may come back, ahahaha

[Verse 3]
Next part, Earl Sweatshirt Kill?
Cool, uh, uh-huh, yeah, uh
Catch me spittin' on this Kill beat
Hopin' that these niggas would just feel me, the real me
My weapon is concealed and
You know I'm a suspect when I walk into the building
I came to London just to make some noise
The shit I say is for grown men, these bars are not for lil' boys
I'm Andy with these toys
You run up on me, you get flexed on like Terry Crews and steroids
Listen, I been ballin' like a Piston
I been marchin' on niggas like I am army enlisted
You run up on me, you get it
My choppa retarded and spittin' on these goofy ass niggas
Pop a roofie, I'm gone, in a whole 'nother zone
Put my dick in yo mom, that's the shit that I'm on
Yeah, that's the shit that I'm on, you ain't on shit 'cause you dumb
You run up on me, you gone, that choppa on me, it's rung
You get hung like a noose
I'm about the war, give a fuck about the truce
All about myself, I give a fuck about you
Matter of fact, I may just shoot the fuck up out you
Put an X next to your name like Malcolm
I guess you didn't weigh your options out, your outcomes
You did the wrong shit on the right day
We turn a white day into a red day
Fuck what yo mom say, fuck what yo dad say
I keep it 3K like my first name Andre
If I go broke, I'm probably servin' like an entree
In Bombay with yo girl suckin' all on me
Off the Xannies, I'm a zombie
Don't believe me, try me, fuck around, stomp you
I'm kinda hungry off the weed, I may chomp you
And that shorty, she a eater, she a muncher
Man I'm feeling like a monster
Straight Jeffrey Dahmer when I'm grippin' the Llama
You don't want problems, no smoke at all
I take your whole pound and smoke it all
I take yo bitches then fuck 'em all
They on my D, I'm hatin', I duck 'em all
And she look at my whole team then suck 'em all
Macaroni on me, it'll buck-buck 'em all
Man somebody tell me to stop, nah, I'ma keep goin', just watch
I take yo Rollie, yo watch, yo bitches all on my cock
You run up on me, get popped, they judge a nigga like Cochran
They forgot to stop it, run up on me here
I got a rocket on me, no launcher
I feel like I am the best-est, I'm deadlier than asbestos
My word is really my weapon, I'm coming back for some seconds
Freestylin's a preference, send you to stairway to heaven
Man, these niggas writin' the shit that I say
The beats beat when I'm beatin' like Doctor the Dre
I pull up on them with the choppa, and screamin' out, ""Hey!
Fuck you, pow pow, have a nice day""
And my wrist is like an ice tray, and yo bitch she do what I say
Yeah, she put her hands in the air when my song come on
Like single ladies and Beyoncé, yeah
And the way that I spit shit
I burn niggas like Jamaicans with the incense
Been the realest with the shit ever since I was an infant
I'm a misfit, Tony Hawk on my grind like a trip tip, you could get hit
Choppa leave you cryin' like a chick flick, I'm a sick kid
Bitch, I been lit, man these niggas ain't shit but some pussies
And pork ass niggas, fuck is a piglet
Fuck is these niggas, I don't fuck with these niggas
A four-leaf clover on a bullet, good luck with these niggas
Man it must suck for these niggas, ol' sufferin' niggas
YouTube ol' video bufferin' niggas
Ol' big bad wolf huff-puffin' ass niggas
'Til I pull up on the scene like, ""You think you hard?""
I put a bullet hole through your muffin ass, nigga
Man, all the songs that I'm bumpin', I got the partiers jumpin'
You run up on me, it's over, that chopper's on me, it's dumpin'
I'll dump you like a bad relationship, hold on, wait, wait, wait
Let me take this shit, it may take a bit
I spit the shit I say, go back, re-say it
Then say somethin' different, replacin' it, man they hatin' us
It's presidential brain from yo bitch Sarah Palin kid
Still sellin' John McCain, like you got yo shit snatched
My flow is off the chain, pull up in the rover, yeah, I got the range
I feel like Drake, nothing was the same
Niggas love to hate, get up out my face before you catch a AK
Shoot him in his face, tell that nigga bye-bye, man down, mayday
Pull up to his mom house and turn it to my safe place
I need a safe haven, I'm too busy slayin'
Dyin' my hair like Super Saiyans, leave his face on the pavement
Jackie Chan when I'm smokin', I really feel like an Asian
Fuck yo bitch when I'm high, call that shit Asian persuasion
I rush out with yo girl, she fuck for hours up in the shower
I feel like I got superpowers, I'm so superb
I'm 'bout the action, you niggas 'bout action verbs
I don't gotta say a word, I shoot for the green, feelin' like Larry Bird
On the competition, I drop and take a turd
Shove it in they ears, they hearin' every word
Really though, I get it poppin' like a nigga hittin' wheelies, ho
Or an ollie, ho, or a molly, ho
Run a train on yo bitch, that's a trolley, ho
Don't try me how I do you like Dej Loaf
You want to go to heaven so bad, here's a halo
My gun sing like J Lo, you better get low like limbo
Before you catch a couple shots for yo kinfolk
I'm Rambo with the ammo, I don't never let go
Money kinda stick to me, call me Juice Velcro
Say you gettin' money now, fuck nigga hell no
You don't like Adidas but this choppa give you shell toes
This choppa give you shell toes
And leave yo ass dancin' on the floor like a red nose
Beam on my gun, that's a red nose
Pull up on the scene, let the shit blow
Yonkers, Yonkers, in this bitch with Westwood, man
[Verse 4]
Yeah, let's do it, oof, got a lil' more bounce to it, don't it?
Uh, uh, I've been going through a lot as of lately
You can call me crazy
Bitches wanna play me
Really I got blueprints
Feelin' like I'm JAY-Z
My flow in the morning, Westwood no Sway B
That's just how it is, boy
My flow so brazy, my flow so cool
My flow so outdated, so old school
But then nigga switch it up to something so new
These niggas walking around like they bulletproof
'Til the bullets shoot, leave the bullets through his sunroof
Kill his son too
Give a fuck, oh, give a fuck
Nah, not what I do
I'm the type to pull up on your youth group

[Verse 13]
Oh

We should take another nigga loss as a lesson, uh
Hopefully, I'm finna meet these niggas up in heaven, uh
I feel like I'm lost in my mind sometimes, uh
I feel like I'm dropped like a dime sometimes, uh
I'm just trying to find out what's mine sometimes, uh
I'm just trying to find out what's mine sometimes, uh, ayy

Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide, go on and hold my gun
Specify, all the lies you've told
Look at me, what am I on?
Percy, Molly, Xanny, all that shit, in one mix
I'm so high that I cannot remember to forget
Matter of fact, let's just take a sec
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
Rest in peace to the niggas that left
And praise all the niggas that's left
I feel like I'm up in my prime
But who am I gon' share my prime with?
Who am I gon' share my time with?
Sometimes it's just perfect timing
Singing like I'm CeCe Winans
Damn, this shit's unwinding
Yuh, yeah, yeah, ayy
Suicide if you try to take my drugs
Homicide if you try to rob my plug, ayy
Homicide if you try to take my gun

Uh, it's been a long time comin'
But I'm still here
Everybody talking 'bout they numb or something, wait
Can you feel here
All this fake shit around me is this some real here
All this sober shit around me is there some pills here
For real, I need to know
I need to know
My mama tell me that I need to let 'em go
She say the syrup in these pills finna kill me
But sometimes I think it brings out the real me
Sometimes I think it brings out the concealed me
Sometimes I think it exposes and reveals me
So what happens when the real meets the real
What happens when Juice meets the pills
Uh-uh-uh, yeah
Westwood shit

Tourin' the world, shittin' on everybody, the world is my potty

Run up on me, choppa make you sing like that
Make you march like Martin Luther King, in fact

I'm shittin' on these niggas, this is a excrement
I rapped on another beat that's some extra shit
You niggas gon' have to deal with the mess of it
I thought I told yo ass not to mess wit' it
I see this shit before I say it, telepathy
It's like I talk to my conscious, I say what it's tellin' me
Anything besides money, eh, it's kinda irrelevant
I can't focus without codeine, my medicine
I sip it until I'm slurrin' and spittin' impediments
I'm ballin' to the point where I think I need a Letterman
Westwood at the gates of London, he just had to let 'em in
I'm here, spazzin' on every single track he pass
You run up, I leave you leakin' on a maxi pad
I'm ballin', hard, these other niggas on the bench
I swear, they need to stay where they at
Nigga, I'm takin' over the world, a map for a map
I'm off of a ecstasy pill, that's a flat for a flat
I'm up to bat, throw a fastball, it's a hit
I hit a lick, then I hit a hit on yo' bitch, I don't miss
Listen, I heard yo' bitch on my hit list, I hit that bitch, then I'm dippin'
You run up on me, I'm shootin', that choppa on me is spittin'
My wordplay is amazing, my flow is so brazy, huh
I'm shakin' shit up like I said, no Haiti
This is freestyle shit, it's authentic
My flow, it burns niggas careers is arsenic, uh
My flow badder than bad women
I rock shows like Kravitz and John Lennon
Yo sins ain't forgivin'
I'm the rap God, call me Juice Allah
Did I take it too far?
Did I take two bars, to get on Mars?
To more like Dubai, hold on
I got a little tongue twisted, but I'm still gifted
Still spittin', still rippin' writtens
This premonition is really killin' it
And these niggas ain't shit
But Civics, me I'm Bentley
Get it, bitch
Don't you forget it
The shit that you talking, I really lived it, uh
I sold my soul then bought it back, I finessed 'em, uh
You run up on me, choppa holy it'll bless 'em, uh
He talking stupid 'til they shoot him, that's my weapon, uh
I got a couple of bars I could spit
Maybe I'll just use 'em in this shit
Or maybe I'll just use 'em in a skit
My first guess, they wanted shit
My next project, it's gon' be harder
My arm in the rim, really, I feel like Vince Carter
I'm at yo head nigga, I feel like a barber
You on the bench nigga, and I am a starter
I die for my shit nigga, feel like I'm a martyr
My shit's off the charts
You run up, that's okay, you catch a hole to your heart

She hangin' out, fuck her curfew, uh
You my son, lil' nigga, I birthed you
But I shine, like the pair of them church shoes
I ain't been to church in a long time, 'cause they all lies
All the legends, where they at? They all die
Well, I don't wanna be a legend up in my prime
But, I know it's still prime time
Stars, how I shine
When they align with the planet, you know some shit is goin' on
I transform like Omegatron when my favorite song is on
Fuckin' that bitch like the Ramadan
Man, I spit shit
So cool
I breakdance shit like the old school
I'm never runnin' out of energy, I'm a suspect grippin' this firearm in your vicinity
Try me if you want, 'cause I swear it's not gon' end cool
I'ma prolly pull up to your cruel like, ""Where the fuck is you?""
Cock it back and then I shoot

Ayy, I flew from London to Chicago
Money in my pockets, I may get a Murciélago

Shout out to my kinfolk, they know I'm totin' ammo
In the streets they call me Rambo, ain't no peace where I'm from
But these pieces, we tote 'em, you run up on me it's over
Like a cig, we gon' smoke 'em
I put yo ass in a coma
Smokin' kush, this aroma, leave yo ass in a coma
Ballin' out like I'm Odom before the crack, don't you get it?
Spittin' crack on these niggas, define niggas like physics

Nigga this shit's enlisted just like a army, lil' nigga
I swear to god I'm invincible you can't harm me lil' nigga, yeah
I'm talkin' to you

No offense, no offense
Please don't proceed to hop up on my dick
Haha, man

Outer space I'm ballin' like I'm shootin' up on Pluto
Talkin' stupid to me 'til I pull up let the tool blow
Emperor new school, call me Juice Kuzco
Known to flip this shit and kick it like I'm knowing Judo
That's just how it goes though
If I touch the world I told you that shit is a snow globe
That's just how my flow is
Living in the moment
Your bitch swallow my kids
I can say that in a million different ways
I can break it down, a million different phrases
Look at all my songs on the playlist
It's evident that I'm your bitches favorite
I ain't even have to say it

They just left my blood on the pavement
Now I gotta come back gotta slay 'em
Nigga what the fuck you thought you was saying?
Run up on me, that's okay, I AK 'em

Your bitch super wet, fresh out the shower

Freestyling on Westwood, you know that we get it in
I ain't come here with no shit written, nah

So I'm off the dome, jet lag kicking
Doin' the best that I can for my niggas, yeah
Ayy, Westwood, we should go shoppin'
I got about twenty thousand dollars in my pocket
I'm tryna buy Balenciagas, no posits
Buy it all, no deposits
If I need more cash, let's hit Chase then make a withdrawal
You know I got it
Interscope got me livin' a lil' proper
I'm hoping that I prosper
My gun is finna sing, that's an Opera
These niggas acting, I think they need a Oscar
Therapy or something, what's they problem?
I'm sick of being modest
I'm like Future at the end of the day, I'm just being honest
Man, I rapped on like seventy beats
Niggas gon' go back and listen to me
Bitches prolly gon' get wet, damn near pissin' to me
On twitter, mentioning me wishing they were with me
Some niggas against me, some niggas don't get me
Some niggas won't hit me
But that's cool, 'cause I'm cool

Especially with all these waves

I'm walkin' in Prada, tryna solve my problems
Through the night, finding vibes, Moonlight Sonata
I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised

I try to deny, but you see the pills in my eyes
I tell her that I'm high, but she don't seem surprised (Uh)

Maybe I realize that my life is a ride
Buckle up, hold tight, take a left, turn right
GPS don't work, can't see at night
So it's getting hard to drive, anxiety at a stoplight
Hard to think, easy to cry, that's how I know something's not right
Numb the pain with fun times, supermotos, Perc lines
Remember that one time everything was alright
Alright (Oh-oh-oh)

Ride a dirt bike down the ditch, see if I live
I knock my subconscious unconscious
They tell me that they can help me, I got this
Watch this, I took my demons into the bank of life and I made the biggest deposit
Without drugs, I'm losing my logic

When I freestyle off the top I'm the best fucking rapper
He sayin' shit he don't do, that nigga is an actor
And if it's up to me, he's not really a benefactor

She on her laptop, gettin' it bustin' on Skype, givin' her backshots
Wait 'til the beat drop, I'm such a bad kid

I just shot his face off, it was a face-off
Nigga, what you wanna? You'll just get smoked like a blunt of marijuana
Every day I'm rollin' up strong, smoking Ganja, pressure

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me
I still see your shadows in my room
Can't take back the love that I gave you
It's to the point where I love and I hate you
And I cannot change you, so I must replace you, oh
Easier said than done, I thought you were the one
Listenin' to my heart instead of my head
You found another one, but I am the better one
I won't let you forget me

[Verse 1: Juice WRLD]
You left me falling and landing inside my grave
I know that you want me dead
I take prescriptions to make me feel a-okay
I know it's all in my head
I have these lucid dreams where I can't move a thing
Thinking of you in my bed
You were my everything
Thoughts of a wedding ring
Now I'm just better off dead (Uh, uh, uh)
I'll do it over again
I didn't want it to end
I watch it blow in the wind
I should've listened to my friends
Leave this shit in the past, but I want it to last
You were made outta plastic, fake
I was tangled up in your drastic ways
Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?
You gave me a heart that was full of mistakes
I gave you my heart and you made heartbreak
[Bridge: Juice WRLD]
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break
You made my heart ache (Can't take back the love that I gave you)
You made my heart break (Were made outta plastic, fake)
You made my heart ache (I still see your shadows in my room)
You made my heart break again (I was tangled up in your drastic ways)
(Who knew evil girls had the prettiest face?)

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Crying, I'm nauseous
I hear that so often
I sometimes get lost in my head
I'm so in love with that girl (Yeah)
I got the juice in this world (Woah)
She don't believe in loyalty, but want diamonds and pearls
Fuck that, I had to man up
Tried to boost my confidence and froze my hand up
I'm still hot, turn that fan on
This shit had me depressed, I almost died off Xan' punch (Yeah)
She said that she love me, but she sucked that boy up (Oh)
You got somethin' to say, go 'head now, boy just speak up (Woah)
Tryna break me down because they can't defeat us (No)
I'm a baker now, like that girl Anita
Should've listened to my boy, he said, ""Don't keep her""
Nowadays, I love you so much, I can't leave ya

Heart saying, ""If she leave, we're going with her, let's go""
I don't wanna let go, girl from seven-three-four

[Verse 1]
Time, time heals all wounds
But time can leave the nastiest scars
This happened too soon
I'm starting to think I don't know who you are
Pills get popped as your love gets stopped
You just sit and watch as I wheeze and cough
I can't breathе at all, I can't breathe it off
I can't breathе with all the pain involved

My other ex could race her to hell and
I'll go through hell just to get a Benz
Free all my niggas locked up in jail and
I will never love a ho again

My ex told me we should try again
I said, “I'll break your heart like you did me“
I hope your boyfriend fucks and you miss me
I hope you say my name when he's hitting
I hope you think of me when you're kissing
I hope you call, I'll decline, I'm busy
I keep on balling, Kobe, I'm swishing

Matter of fact, I don't wanna go there
I told my girl I'll give her the world
Let's go to London, I got a show there
Forget the past, I left all my hoes there
We're moving fast, there's no moving slow here
Girl if we crash, at least it was worth it
I'll make it last, you make me feel perfect

And she gon' ride like a roller coaster
And I'm gon' hide when the love is over
But it's far from over, losing composure
In a coffin, laying stiff like a boulder

Lost in a dark place

Lost in a dark place, trapped in the crawlspace
In my mind, I get lost, then I wake up in a coffin
They tell me they care, they're just in love with the music
So they'll never know about the pain I go through
It's like a chain of reactions, all these demon attacks
From all the drugs that I'm taking to the women distracting me
From being myself, it's like I'm losing my traction
Kiss death on the lips, I have a fatal attraction
This is my heart, watch as my problems inspire me
Tear me apart, won't let the demons take over me
They took it too far, now I need some surgery
I'm falling apart
It's like I'm lost in the motions, use this song as a rope
To wrap around the commotion, tie the knot at my throat
I look at death as a notion, I don't want it no more
But it's too late to reverse it, as I fall on the floor

My heart stops, every time you call my name

You fell from the stars, girl, am I lost?
When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober

Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over

No, I can't fix your broken past
Count my blessings, close my eyes
I'm right back in your room tonight (Oh)
I can't escape your shadow (Oh)
I can't forget what we don't know (Oh)
Your love is a sentence to death row
And you've got a seat in the front row (Oh)
Hold me close but you're cold as ice (Oh)

My heart stops, every time you call my name

When you're down, when you're sad, is it my fault?
I apologize for all of the lies, oh
I won't treat you like the rest of them guys, oh

You say it makes me act atrocious
But I can't stand life when I'm sober
Take my heart, I'll hand it over
Six months in, it gets colder
I don't want us to be over
Let's make love 'til we die
And let's fuck until we slump over

Be my first aid, I know that you hate to see me bleed

Got the drugs on the table, I'm ready
I put Rick on your slippers, no Cinderella
Remember when you went to the fortune teller
She told you, we ""need each other""
Ha, what if she trippin? I'm just kiddin'
Back to the main focus, I think that you're gorgeous
You love the way that I stroke it, signin' my name on your neck
You used to make potions, playin' round with witchcraft
I wonder if you'll put that in my lean and I'll drink that

Fuck, I owe fines, the devil say I owe him for life
But I could feel it, I got God on my side
Remember when He sent you to me that night
Had to cuff you up, like a cop on a heist
Cupid is the judge, so I must testify
I won't move or budge, I'll stand by you for life
All my life, when you die is when I die
I sometimes wonder why
We argue and fight
And quickly make things right
It's probably 'cause we gotta grow more over time
Wouldn't be real love without rough nights
Can't feel these drugs, but I feel your eyes
When you look at mine, things feel alright

Been through it, I don't really wanna get into it
Throwin' out your heart to break mine, so I won't do it
Also, baby, you're my lifeline, you're an influence
All the times you was mad, I was over under the influence
I feel sorry for the people that don't get it
It's really rare that you feel the real love feelin'
Some people get hurt and never love again
Some people get hurt and give the drugs a binge
Some people get dressed and go and hit the club to mend
There's no love in one-night stands, but you can play pretend
And me, I'ma admit it
All of these hoes one thing, that's pretentious
And if I know one thing, then I know this
It's us forever, worse or better, no discussion, that's how I'm comin'

Mayhem will break them
Words from the evil faces

[Pre-Chorus]
Drugs will fade them (Away)
Pop three, I lace them (Away, away, away)
Welcome to my abyss (Welcome, welcome, welcome)
Pain and suffering (Welcome, welcome, oh, welcome)
[Chorus]
Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space-traveling
Tryna find some inner peace, inner peace

[Verse 2]
It's pain in those words, you can hear it when I talk
But what's a life to live if you ain't got no risk involved?
And what's a slit to make if you ain't got no wrist involved?
Mixin' pills with the liquor, fuck, I'm finna risk it all
Still a cool dude, too smooth, just like olive oil
Known to pop pills, pop niggas, and pop ollies, boy
And pop wheelies, ghost ride it, my mind is enlightened
I'm high as the highest, don't need no ghostwriter
Bitch I speak for myself, but my health ain't my wealth
'Cause I'm rich in my bank, but I'm bad with myself
Bombin' like a kamikaze, I'm the shit to these hoes
I set the play, these niggas flock, they settin' picks for me, ho
I came in killin', I'm really fuckin' the industry up
These niggas shady, they really leavin' me mentally fucked
Trapped inside the abyss with a bad bitch in the front
With a blunt in my mouth and some purple codeine in the cup (What?)

[Bridge]
Spazzin' on they asses in all type of ways
Pop a couple Percs to take my life away
Nah, just a lighter day, just a brighter day
She doin' all the lines, she had a whiter day, uh
Freestylin', no writers, ayy
That mean when the songs come out I get paid
No cuts, give no fucks
I show out before I even go and show up
[Verse 3]
So what? I drink Henny till I throw up
So what? It's red lean in that white cup
Pull up on 'em like, beep, that's a tow truck
Choppa on me like, damn, nigga, don't duck
Duck, goose when I catch 'em
Niggas askin' questions, stop throwin' hatchets
Never had a father, always been a bastard
Fuck with me, I'll beat your ass, your head is in a plaster
They don't make sense like spelling ""rich"" backwards, I'm madder
Run up, that's okay, your head is on a platter
Outta space off the codeine, I'm on Saturn
Niggas got it backwards, dyslexic patterns, pff
I don't believe in you niggas, a nigga atheist
Say this, I spray it, say it, don't spray it, I'll spray it, don't say it
Presidential brain from your main, S. Palin
Pull up on the scene, judge a nigga, no bailiff
Flow go cold, shine like VVS, nigga, fuck rose gold
It's like $50k inside my wardrobe
I get new bitches, these niggas fuck worn hoes
You a whore, ho, you know it, I don't gotta say it
Pull up on the scene, my choppa just like Alizée
Poppin' like a bottle, I fuck on a model
I don't wanna fuck if that bitch don't plan to swallow
I told her boyfriend he could swallow all the hollows
Don't believe me, send your location, I'll be there tomorrow (I'll be there tomorrow)
[Chorus]
Lost my mind, trapped in me
I don't know what's happening
I've been space traveling

Ex-bitch tryna finesse me, she won't get a damn thing
Listen to my story, it's depressing
Heartbreak mixed with the drugs, not the best thing
The devil tryna test me I'm failing, inhaling
You took it all back
All that heartbreak that was a year ago
Wanted you back so bad, but that's

You really had me feeling helpless, that's so selfish

Haven't been in love in a long while
Wait until my next girl finds out
Then I'm scared we gon' break up and fall out
Drownin' in my thoughts, baby, looking for a lighthouse
Ain't no sleep, I've been feeling like a night owl
Music turnt up, neighbors telling me to pipe down
On the other hand, I think I found my future wife
But she not here with me, so it get lonely at night, ayy

I hope her love doesn't go away
I hope this ain't a phase
One more heartbreak and I'll be

[Verse 1]
I cross my T's and dilate my eyes
I live with her in mind
They say, ""Livin’ life is free,"" I'll have to deny
'Cause everyday I pay the price
I wake up feelin’ like last night was a wild car ride
Welcome to the fast life
I pop these, watch how the time flies
Outer-space, black skies lookin' like sci-fi
But that's only half of me
That's only half of me, that's one side
But don't be sad with me
And don't feel bad for me, it's alright

[Chorus]
Addictions remind me of the summer
’Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger, yeah
Addictions remind me of the summer
’Mind you, I was younger
Trying to kill my hunger

[Verse 2]
Percocets, nicotine, red promethazine
Good sex, fast cars, I'd crash anything
That is a smoke screen, none of those things make me happy
Sold my soul, now I can buy anything
Sad but I’m not a bitch, don't try anything
'Cause I'll kill gladly, that’s the only thing that make me happy
Turn the frown off when the racks in
Ain't no fentanyl up in my xans
If I could end all of the withdrawals
I would, but sadly, I can't
Thinkin' back, it probably started with the Vyvanse
Now I'm starin' at Oxycontin in my hand
Rehab'll only ruin my plans
On the bright side, I'm makin' progression
I was takin' four, now I'm takin' one less
'Til I drop the codeine in the Sunkist
Said, ""Fuck it,"" grabbed the pint and poured the whole shit

Woke up on the hospital gurney

Codeine in my IV, mix it with the Hi-C
Higher than a high-five, everyone below me
I was ""Mr. Nice Guy"" I guess that's the old me
Made me bawl my eyes out, I deserve a trophy
Why you blocking my love? What are you, a goalie?
Startin' to feel the fame, don't know how to maintain it

Hold my hand I'ma walk with danger

Or maybe it was real I'm super high and super angry

And I got my mind on you, no thinkin'

I got your name, tatted on my brain, tatted on my mind
Teen Titan, got the Starfire by my side
Clark Kent if she kiss me, it make me fly
Sad boy, if she leaves me it makes me cry
Flash boy, if she needs me, be there in no time
She's all right, so I gave it a go, I gave it a turn
I gave her my heart, I'm willin' to learn
And it changed my life, I'm tryna get close with the stars tonight
[Chorus]
Even when I'm sleep, I feel awake when you're away
Everything with you is such a chase, cut to the chase
Almost left my side the other day, it makes me shake
Knowin' you were gon' walk away, you can't be replaced
Can't tell you how I feel, I can't explain
For you I'ma try to get these lyrics out my brain
And for you I will fly, through the hell, through the flames
Always, always, love you always

They tell me that I won't live to see tomorrow, but I don't give a fuck
I'm running out of patience, out of pleasure, and runnin' out of luck
I'm really scared that we won't stay together
What if you run out of your love? You run out of your love

I hope you know, if I said it, baby, I meant it
Straight lovers, we ain't goin' to a friendship
Fell for you, I don't know how it happened (Uh)
When we kissin', I taste all the passion
Time worth more than money, but I'll spend
All of it on you, me and you, until the end
No talking, baby, I'm about that action
All these othеr hoes are so irrelеvant, honest
You taught me what real love is

My bad for all of the stressful times that we had
I know you scared that I'm gon' relapse, I love that
Where the drugs at? You know that I love that
Let's go out tonight, where the clubs at?
Endless drugs, I remember dub sacks in my blunts
Now we sippin' Wock' out a double cup, yeah

Wasn't real love in high school

Her voice sounds like a stereo, and it's up in my head
When she is not around, it feels like I'ma turn up dead
I'm calling on her phone, telling her I'm full of dread
I wish that she was here, playing in my dreads
She told me she really likes me, I hope it's not a fib
I told myself I wouldn't go through the same shit again
She runnin', runnin' through my head like a race, she tryna win
But she don't know that she don't got no competition
I'm in Paris by myself, it feel like something's missin'

Leave me alone, I done moved on to somethin' different
I'm finally gettin' the feeling I was missin'

Having chest pains, feelin' like I'm endin'
This is real life, I am not pretendin'

Uh, get my tongue involved, she got me in awe, baby
Give me it all, uh, feel it through my draws, baby

(My shit make all them sounds, fuck you talkin' 'bout)

[Chorus]
I grip the K like a Russian (Okay, yeah)
Quarterback sack, bitch I'm rushing (Okay, yeah)
Count up the cash in American, English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian (Oh yeah)
I'm at yo' head like concussion
She give me head like concussion
Love when she suck with her tongue and she put it in her throat like a mo'fuckin' cushion
Why police look at me crooked? (Why?)
I'm a young nigga gettin' that money, that's why
Look at they eyes just be crooked (Why?)
All these bitches be ugly, them beady-ass eyes
You gettin' jewelry taken
You claim that you totin', how come you ain't let that bitch fly?
I never get jewelry taken
My bitch'll shoot you in the face if you think about tryin'
[Verse 1]
My money make me a giant, oh
I hit 'em like Fee-Fi-Fo, yeah
If I go broke, I'ma take his dough, rob him for his dough, yeah
These niggas asking me where I come from
I come from the city where it's colder (Let's go)
Always gotta look over your shoulder (Uh)
Never know when someone wanna smoke ya (Grrah)
Man down, look, who is the man now?
Can't wait till the drugs touch down
Me and Lotti, Max finna have a Perc-go-round
Chris lyin' saying he puttin' them down
Know he pop Percs every time they around (Lyin' ass nigga)
And when that lean around, Lotti say it make her frown (I ain't tryna make you frown)
I'm a different person when I'm off of the pour up
Catch a body and I won't even know it
I make a song off the purple, I'm focused
Make an album, shit it out, hocus pocus
Catch him lackin', I'ma shoot in the open
Like a cigarillo, bitch I'ma smoke him
L-O-L, all of these niggas be jokin'
They may just make me kill them, they keep provokin'

My bitch'll shoot you in the face if you think about tryin'
[Verse 2]
March on the beat like a mo'fuckin' sergeant
That .40 on me, shoot like I'm from the squadron
Moncler on the moon boots, I'm not from this planet
I promise to God, I'm a mo'fuckin' martian
Call me Juice WRLD the martian, I'm Marvin the Martian
I'm super like Marvel, my drip is so marvelous
Dropped the Death Race For Love, it sold so much the first week
That shit goin' harder than granite and marbles
It may just go platinum on niggas that haven't gone gold in a minute, these niggas been slippin'
Pussy remind me of pussy niggas, I kill pussy with dick, pussy niggas with Smith &
I don't got time for these rookie niggas, yeah, I know I'm a rookie, far from a beginner
I used to smoke purple but that shit got old, now I smoke Gelato, Biscotti, I'm pimpin', oh yeah
That nigga trippin', gon' and get rid of him
These niggas really ain't rappers, they don't got no rhythm, they hide behind 808s and all the synths
I'm yo' father, Darth Vader, red beam, I'm the Sith
Heard yo' lil' bitch got herpes, don't think that I'm kiddin'
Why you think she ain't fuck you or suck you in a minute?
Tried to give it to me, bitch, I'm taken, you trippin'

[Chorus]
I grip the K like a Russian (Okay, yeah)
Quarterback sack, bitch I'm rushing (Okay, yeah)
Count up the cash in American, English, Spanish, Chinese and Russian (Oh yeah)
I'm at yo' head like concussion

My bitch'll shoot you in the face if you think about tryin'
[Outro]
I don't even gotta shoot
My bitch'll shoot you in the face (Got it on Smash)
Then she shoot your bitch in the face
Then we shoot your bitch in the face
Then we may go out for a date
After shootin' you in the face19Embed"

Still gotta put a fuck nigga up in his place
He ain't know I kept it on my waist
Fuck it, had to up it anyway
They don't know I keep one on my waist
Fuckin' had to up it anyway
They ain't know I keep it on my waist
Fuck it, had to up it anyway
He be talkin' crazy, fuck it, I would bust it any day
On my mama, on my granny, on my gang
I already know it's, ""Fuck that shit you claim""
Fuck that clique you claim
I don't tolerate no disrespect
Got his bitch, she givin' neck
We be at these niggas neck
And she do that for a Percocet
She be poppin' Percocets for real
Everywhere I go, I'm down to drill
And everywhere I go, I'm down to kill (Yeah)
I told that nigga this is not a drill
That .40 on me too, I keep a drill
You don' want no problems over here
I told you I've been ballin' since a kid
Yeah, feel like Jason Kidd
[Chorus]
I miss ridin' round town with my friends
.40 in the stash box, we ain't come to start nun'
Cooler than the boys in the band

Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay
Good days, good days, reminisce the good days
Close my eyes, I tell myself it's okay

[Verse 2]
Now we're all grown up, we all came a long way from the start
We all went the wrong way once or twice
But we can't help that shit, it's life
I miss my old friends, 'member we was doin' Xans
Up in school, the teachers said we would be in jail or dead
Now I make way more money than them
Hit up the plug, spend they rent, I bought a pint, red Hi-Tech
I miss my mom, I miss my friends, I miss my house, I miss my pet
""Laila, fetch""
Mom, come to L.A., I'll get you a jet
Got off my ass and I got to a check
Feelin' sorry for the niggas who slept
Yeah, on me and my gang, 'cause we runnin' shit this year
Fuck a phone, I'm gon' hold them hundreds to my ears, ayy

Trapped in my head, she has the key
She walks me to her bed, I can't wait to see the freaky things
She does to me
All her old niggas, they are under me
But back to you, baby, you're a Picasso piece
Yes, indeed, you're lovely and I can't help it
Follow me through the hell and the storm
Honestly, feel like I've been here before
Probably visited here in my dreams
I came here looking for you

But she a bigger rockstar than I am

Coke in her nose ring
Molly in her nails
I'm racing her to hell

Would I know her well enough to know?

Coke in her nose ring

She gon' die a rockstar
Racing her to hell

But I know her well enough to know

Posin' in them ripped jeans
Louis V her heels (Louis V her heels)
Hand full of xans
She a rockstar for real (Rockstar for real)
I don't really know her
I just know her well enough to know (Well enough to know)

I don't really know her well but I know her
All she wanna do is live in the moment
Pick up the pills and mix up the potions
Get high for real, she not with the posin'
All she ever wanna do is molly in the ocean
I met her in Hollywood and I knew she was poison
She told me take two of these and call her in the mornin'
I ain't been the same since
I know when you take that road you can't go back, oh
My heart cold and she know that too
Play your role and I'll play my games
We could roll that dice but know I won't lose
No I won't lose, you can pick and choose
It don't matter what I do, I just wanna be a rockstar like you

Max c'mon we gotta do one take and shit
I don’t wanna even need no lean so pump it up

[Verse 1]
New nigga on the block, yeah I got my Glocky
Look like I've been locked up, arms kinda stocky
Wrist on rocky, wish a nigga tried to stop me
Usain Bolt with the glizzy it's a track meet
Make him take off like Migos
In the kitchen whippin’ up the bricks, servin' kilos
If I gotta get in your door I pick the key-hole
Full of shit, bitches, boy these hoes like A-holes
Every day I wake up, thinkin' 'bout the Pesos
Gettin' bankrolls, sayin' RIP to Bankroll, keep the dank rolled
Codeine in the double cup I'm sippin', ayy
Stevie Wonder, it’s gonna take away my vision, ayy
007, with that Glock, I got precision, ayy
You be talkin’ 'bout the shit, when I been did it, ayy
Free my niggas in that jam (Yeah)
I don’t give a shit, and I don't give a Hoover damn
Last bitch said I wasn't shit, she wanna let me cram (Bitch)
Hit it from the back, oh yes I am
Chopper make your brains turn to eggs, Sam-I-Am
I had a feelin' they was gon’ switch up, ​will.i.am
Two pints of Wockhardt, sealed up, in my hand
Clean nigga, but I'm sippin' 'til I do the muddy dance
Broke nigga, I got rich and now I do the money dance
Feel like Hugh Hefner, these bitches finna do the bunny dance
On the dick, for a trick, then after that she fucked her friend
I ain't gonna trick off no bitch, I don't pay, I just get in
[Bridge]
I ain't really usually the one to be talking my shit, but
I think I'm finna talk my shit one time for the one time
Two times, maybe a few times
Ruinin' careers, man this shit easy
What my nigga Davis say, this shit beyond me, yo, ayy

[Verse 2]
Okay I'm back in, gettin' it crackin', with ya broad
After she helped me get my rocks off, she fucked the squad
They think I'm a bitch because they heard the sad songs, that's a façade
I'm one of them niggas that'll have an atheist screamin' out to God
I don't want no problems, really, I'm just tryna get my sack up
But if it's a problem, bruh gon' come and shoot you from the neck up

Got killers, Texas silver black berettas if they disrespect us
