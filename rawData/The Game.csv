Real nigga shit
Other night at your crib, it was like me, Black, 40, OB
We just sittin' there talkin' 'bout life
Played some beats, but I forgot to tell you one thing
[Verse 1: The Game]
Niggas called me to set you up
Want me to come and wet you up
'Cause you a out of town nigga like Biggie
Heard about the shit with Diddy
So I came through to vest you up
And I got a vest for 40, a vest for Hush
A vest for every nigga with an owl on his chest and what
I got L.A. unified
You better off committin' suicide, teachers ain't testin' us
See, I know how it feel to be platinum-plus
Niggas is jealous of you, so they try to wrap you up
Tax you up, but it's OVO/Blood Money
Nigga catch these bullets like he catch the bus
Dawg, fame is a motherfucker
Do a nigga four favors, when you can't do the fifth
How soon they forget?
Run up on you at your granny house, give you nine like Fif'
How are niggas s'posed to love you niggas?
Heart beatin' fast when I dap and when I hug you niggas
Drake told me not to trust you niggas
Your energy off, you're finicky, I rush you niggas
Just walkin' 'round the crib like, ""Why a nigga can't live?
Get this money, fuck these bitches though?""
Thinkin' 'bout the beef like:
""We can pass these mothafuckin' straps like a physical""
This my city, nigga, everybody know it
Ridin' 'round town, just me and my four-pound
Tucked in my Tom Fords, hopin' I ain't gotta show it
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit, 40, I'm fucked up
[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one
[Verse 2: Drake]
Thank me later, thanks for nothin', thanks for bluffin'
Thank you so, so much for wearin' your true colors
To every single fuckin' function
Had niggas tell me to my face how we were family
And how they love me while they were skimmin' off the budget
Now, when I see 'em, they're the ones that's actin' funny
People been reachin' out to me
And I'm on some straight unresponsive shit
I would have so many friends
If I didn't have money, respect and accomplishments
I would have so many friends
If I held back the truth and I just gave out compliments
I would have all of your fans
If I didn't go pop and I stayed on some conscious shit
I would have so many more friends
If I lost my success and my confidence
I'm in the club every time that they play the competition
If they even play the competition and I seen the response they get
Yeah, nobody's even hearin' it, on top of the pyramid
Might go to Jamaica, disappear again
My circle got so small that it's a period, sayin' to myself
[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid
L.A. niggas be the craziest, yeah, one hunnid
L.A., all I ever asked is one hunnid
L.A., L.A. niggas be the craziest, one hunnid
All I ever asked is one

[Verse 3: The Game]
Miss 4 Cent, that was my real nigga
Held a nigga down since he was a lil' nigga
If he was still alive, he would kill niggas
He was Lil' Snupe, I was Meek Mill
Niggas know how it feel when you missin' your nigga though
Can't think, so you roll up that indigo
Stressin' while drivin' down Figuero'
Blowin' kush clouds until his ghost is in my Ghost, damn
Make a real nigga wanna give his life to God like, ""Here it go""
Screamin' Frog name at the clouds, they don't hear me though
Guess they too busy with 2Pac and Biggie though
You niggas don't feel me though
That was on Suge's watch, I'll take Suge's watch
You dissin' Drizzy, that's cool, but don't come to my city though
Not even to H-Town
So underground that I gotta be a trill nigga
Strapped up from the waist down
That's word to Pimp C, J Prince is my real nigga
Shit was so simple when Henchman was out
He had a young nigga right there with Meech
So happy when Bleu Davinci got out
We came up on these California streets
L.A. niggas be the craziest, these niggas do some shady shit
Niggas'll run up on your car, catch you off guard
Like the Lil Wayne and Baby shit
Got a nigga confused, but why a nigga gotta choose?
Don't even matter, dawg, cause I'ma always be a real nigga
Always be a real nigga
I never learned how to be nothin' but a real nigga
[Chorus: Drake & The Game]
Y'all better not come to my studio with that fake shit
Y'all better not come to my funeral with that fake shit
Y'all better off realizin' there's nothin' that y'all could do wit' me
All I ever asked is keep it eight more than 92 with me, one hunnid

Get my people out them chains, nigga
I mean handcuffs, time to man up
Put my hands up? Fuck you sayin', bruh?
'Cause I'm a black man in a Phantom
Or is it 'cause my windows tinted?
Car cost 300 thou' and I blow Indo in it (2 Chainz!)
You mad 'cause your daughter fuck with me on spring break
Well, I'ma fuck her till the springs break
[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, roll another one 'cause I'm winnin'
In my four-door, lookin' real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won't expire
I'm in a class of my own, my teacher got fired
Money gettin' long, pussy rate keep risin'
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses, did it from the wee hours
Sellin' that chicken; no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power, then you get respect
I'm gettin' so much money I can buy your bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women workin' naked
Fell in love with a waitress—what the fuck I'm thinkin'?
Bought that ho a ring, it was for her pinky
Uhn, that's pimpin', that's slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent
[Verse 2: The Game]
Fuck y'all mad at me for? Got a black card and a black Phantom
With a white bitch in Idaho, I do the same thing in (Montana)
Got a thick bitch in Atlanta, got a redbone in the Chi
Got two chains, they two-tone, two hundred racks, no lie

[Chorus 1: The Game]
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
I'm 'bout to rumble in the jungle in these new Kanye's
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
My lawyer threw them gloves on and beat another case

[Verse 3: The Game]
Fuck y'all mad at me for, 'cause my belt got two G's on it?
Her bag got two C's on it? My daughter's stroller got D's on it?
Free Big Meech, free Boosie and C-Murder
Like New Orleans, like Baltimore, come to Compton you'll see murders
And my AR see murders, that's beef, nigga; no burgers
I'm insane and you Usain, nigga better turn on them burners
Got coke swimmin' in that glass jar, bitch, go turn on them burners!
Got dope to sell in this hotel, no half price, no retail
You a bitch nigga; no female, I smack niggas; Sprewell
I'm on the block like D12, I got the white; no D-12
Like a little nigga in Africa, I was born totin' that K
And that's real shit, no Will Smith and no Nona Gaye
But they yellin'…
[Chorus 2: The Game]
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle—fuck it, let 'em spray!

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I take my case to trial, hire the Dream Team
Robbie Kardashian, Johnnie Cochran; I seen things
I dream big, I think sharp
Inhale smoke, Hawaiian tree bark
Humble yourself, you not a G, keep it one with yourself
Run to niggas for help, favors I keep one on the shelf
I got rifles with lasers, swing it just like the majors
Hit you right above navel
Now you swimmin' in pavement
Gold medals on my neck, I call it Michael Phelps
Hoes settlin' for less, I call 'em bottom shelf
Niggas tough on them blogs and never did nothin' at all
On the road to the riches, bitches not taggin' along

[Verse 5: The Game]
Unless it's ass in a thong, hit that ass and I'm gone
Disrespect my nigga Boss and I'm flashin' the chrome
I'm wavin' the TEC, Tity sprayin' the MAC
Extendos in the back, gonna lap
I got a bitch that look like Laila Ali sittin' in my lap
Got a call from Skateboard, pick 'em up at LAX
Speakin' skateboards, where Tune at? Fuck with him
I'll break a skateboard on a nigga back, 2 Chainz!
[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, ""No Lie"" already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with a ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys, we bring 'em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche 'em, we clean 'em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence. If you got work
Go to work, don't work at your residence

[Verse 7: The Game]
…For presidents
Word to Muhammad, that triple beam is heaven-sent
Ridin' through the jungles in that mothafuckin' elephant
That's a gray Ghost, with the ears on it
Swimmin' through the hood like it got fins on it (Tell 'em!)
You know I got that work on the foreman grill
Weigh the mothafuckas in, made another mil
Got a nigga feelin' like Cassius Clay
Thrilla in Manilla, nigga want it, whip his ass today

[Chorus 2: The Game]
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Thank God that a nigga seen another day
Ali Bomaye! Ali Bomaye!
Got a chopper and a bottle—fuck it, let 'em spray!

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Coming up I was confused, my mommy kissing a girl
Confusion occurs coming up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out committing felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check, check out my melody""
I wanna live good so, shit, I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next morning, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothing good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Verse 2: The Game]
(G-G-G-G-G-Unit!) On the grill of my lowrider
Guns on both sides, right above the gold wires
I'll fo'-five 'em, kill a nigga on my song
And really do it, that's the true meaning of a ghostwriter
10 G's will take your daughter out her Air Forces
Believe in me, homie, I know all about losses
I'm from Compton, wear the wrong colors, be cautious
One phone call'll have your body dumped in Marcy
I stay strapped like car seats
Been bangin' since my lil' nigga Rob got killed for his Barkleys
That's 10 years, I told Pooh in '95
I'll kill you if you try me for my Air Max 95's
Told Banks when I met him I'ma ride
And if I gotta die, I'd rather homicide
I ain't have 50 cent when my grandmama died
Now I'm going back to Cali
With my Jacob on, see how time fly?

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginning to the end
Losers lose, winners win
This is real, we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in is full of pressure and pain
Enough of me, nigga, now listen to Game

[Verse 3: The Game]
Used to see Five-O, throw the crack by the bench
Now I'm fuckin' with 5-0, it's all starting to make sense
My mom's happy, she ain't gotta pay the rent
And she got a red bow on that brand new Benz
Waiting on Sha Money to land, sitting in the Range
Thinking how they spent 30 million dollars on airplanes
When there's kids starvin'
Pac is gone and Brenda still throwing babies in the garbage
I wanna know what's going on like I hear Marvin
No schoolbooks, they used that wood to build coffins
Whenever I'm in the booth and I get exhausted
I think, ""What if Marie Baker got that abortion?"" I love you, ma

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't going nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine, homie, until my heart stop

(Bitch I'm a motherfuckin' martian)

[Verse 1: The Game]
Blood gang kill 'em all, Odd Future Wolf Gang
Kidnap a vampire, drain all his fuckin veins
Wolf Grey Jordans, use his intestines for the strings
Snatch up Rihanna and throw her in front of a fuckin' train
Sniff a fucking unemployment line of cocaine
Tie Lil B up to a full tank of propane
Swag, now watch him cook...and just stand there and look
Have a bonfire with old Harry Potter books
Martians vs. Goblins, goons vs. the crooks
And since me and Tune had Viacom shook
I shoulda got a real-ass pirate to do the hook
Maybe Jack Sparrow maybe Peter Pan's nemesis
My power's limitless like Blanka on Sega Genesis
Superhero, mad that Marvel overlooked me
Cause Spiderman and Hulk straight pussy

[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
A year ago, I was poor, somewhat
Now my future's brighter than Christopher's new haircut
Bruno Mars is still sucking dick and fucking male butts
In the same closet that Tyler Perry gets clothes from
I suck? Where the fuckin Ring Pops?
You got a better chance of getting a copy of Detox
Wolf Gang, we rock, crack rock and that shit was expected
Like Jayceon whenever he name-drop (Fuck you, Tyler)
Jesus, motherfucking Theresa
This nigga Game got Wolf Haley for this feature
My team is running shit like we have full-cleat Adidas
Getting chased by the polices on a full bred Cheetah
Bishop Eddie caught me tryna escape
Bag full of drag and a Nicki Minaj mixtape
Dragging all you fags to the back of the log cabin
Fall back like Lebron's hairline against the Mavericks, he lost

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Bitch I'm a muthafuckin Martian (I'm a goddamn Goblin)

(Chuck, fuck wit' me) I do
Cause Lil Tunechi always bless me (achoo)
He killed me on my own track, so what? Not you
Fuck you, I spit like I had kids with Erykah Badu
I fucked her on the day of that naked video shoot
I was sucking that pussy like it was wonton soup
Then I hit Lebron's mom in bron-bron's coupe
With Delonte West taping, we had bon-bons too
With Cleveland cheerleaders, they had pom-poms too
So I smacked them bitches wearing Bishop Don Juan's suit
(Where was Snoop?) I don't know, probably doing what the Crips do
But when I'm with my uncle, fuck it! Then I'm a Crip too
And I will Crip Weezy, Crip Jones, and Crip you
Now I'm the Doggfather, walking with a Shih Tzu
Mad that DC comics overlooked me
Cause Captain America's straight pussy

Tell them mothafuckas I'm forever paid
California king, wrestle gators in that Everglade
Drive up out that mothafuckin' swamp in the Escalade
So before you put that red rag in your pocket
I wanna see your fuckin' résumé
Started off on Ground Zero, then I start to levitate
Rip rappers a new asshole – I never hesitate
Dre Beats on, smokin' that chronic just to meditate
I'ma give 'em hurricanes until another levee break
You niggas is featherweight, I'm Aftermath's heavyweight
Now Dre's weapon of mass destruction is 'bout to detonate
When a nigga Wack found me, shit, I was sellin' weight
Now a nigga's sellin' millions, now it's time to celebrate
Performin' in front of millions, nigga, every race
6-4 in the '64, now watch the Chevy scrape
Fourth album, no five mics? Then let 'em hate!
But I'm not stoppin' till I'm the fuckin' king in every state

Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot

For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children

Can't you hear my heart beatin'? That's the motherfuckin' Westside
You test me, you test God, I'm His son
It say in Psalms, you come at me
Then I can split you with this Tommy gun
You won't have no time to run
I'm from the Compton slums, and that's how the West ride
I'm from the city where two of the best died
Rest in peace to both of 'em, spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Damn, I said I spit like I'm the ghost of 'em
Name your top 10, I'm harder than the most of 'em
Matter of fact, shorten your list, nigga, top 5

And serve niggas, give a fuck what you ordered

Gave you Doctor's Advocate, you ripped it out the package
Came with LAX, since critics said it was average
I was stressed the fuck out, torn between Aftermath and
Geffen, Interscope, now I got you in the scope
Spill the red ink on the paper, it's like my pen is broke
And this is what you all been waitin' for
I'm the lost angel knockin' on Satan's door
What the fuck y'all take me for?
I love you ‘cause you hate me more
I'm Kobe on the Lakers floor, except I give you 84
Shake you like Haiti's floor
Walk up on you, like, ""What's goin' on, baby boy?""
Shots in that Mercedes door
Either I'm crazy or the black Slim Shady or
Could that be the reason that Baby said he would pay me more?
But I still owe Jimmy one more album
The best the West has ever seen, no disrespect to Calvin
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Recognize my life, ridicule my fight
Give me fuel for the fire burnin' when I yearn these lights
In the midst of the hieroglyphs my fingertips start to write
Get familiar with Cartwright, ‘cause I want that shot
I'm a raging bull when the needle drops
For the record, I'ma wreck it, even if my record don't pop
I'ma tie a knot on a downtown buildin'
Let it tow behind me, tell 'em they can find me
In the dark with the ghetto children
Look at my heart, nigga, fuck your feelings, this is me
[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick, and I wear pendant on my shoulder
Soldier, like a lieutenant
And the coupe tinted, got pulled over
Johnny always lock a nigga down, knowin' damn well
We don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size
Ride like Pac in his prime; Thug Life is now on radar
'Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscin' when the L.A. Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickridin'
I'm addicted to Westsidin'
Livin' in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turned me to a lion
Tryin'… and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city where a nigga hadn't seen that shit
""Compton!"" – a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never TV-screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit!

[Outro]
Red is a very emotionally and intense color. It enhances human metabolism, increases respiration rate, and raises blood pressure. It has a very high visibility, which is why stop signs, stop lights, and fire equipments are usually painted red. It also represents one third of California's gang population. Needless to say, please dress accordingly while visiting the Los Angeles area. Also, tuck your jewellry, and keep your hands inside your vehicle. Thank you! Enjoy it!51Embed"

Punk-ass motherfucker, checkin' shit
What you was gonna do?
Kill me in my sleep, you bitch-ass nigga?
2Pac, Biggie – shut the fuck up!
Fuckin' dogs, barkin' and shit
(Don't shoot, don't shoot!)
Fuck you, nigga!

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 1: The Game]
Take me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary
Take me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley
Take me away, like I overdosed on cocaine
Or take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide
I'm from a windy city like Do or Die
From a block close to where Biggie was crucified
That was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason
And you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?
‘Cause that's Jesus, people – and Game, he's the equal
Hated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel
Yeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel
Like I needed my father, but he needed a needle
I need some meditation so I can lead my people
They askin', ""Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?""
And why every hood nigga feed off evil?
Answer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night

I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 2: The Game]
We are not the same, I am a Martian
So approach my Phantom doors with caution
You see them 24s spinnin'? I earned 'em
And I ain't no preacher, but here's my Erick Sermon
So eat this black music and tell me how it taste now
And fuck Jesse Jackson, ‘cause it ain't about race now
Sometimes I think about my life, with my face down
Then I see my sons and put on that Kanye smile
Damn, I know his mama proud; and since you helped me sell my dream, we can share my mama now
And like M.J.B. no more drama now
Livin' the good life, me and Common on common ground
I spit crack, and niggas could drive it out of town
Got a Chris Paul mindstate, I'm never out of bounds
My life used to be empty like a Glock without a round
Now my life full like a chopper with a thousand rounds
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide
Lookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night
Dear Lord, you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life
Like what the hell am I doin' right? My life

[Verse 3: The Game]
Walk through the gates of hell, see my Impala parked in front
With the high beams on, me and the devil sharin' chronic blunts
Listenin' to the Chronic album, playin' backwards
Shootin' at pictures of Don Imus for target practice
My mind fucked up, so I cover it with a Raider hood
I'm from the city that made you motherfuckers afraid of Suge (Compton, Compton)
Made my grandmother pray for good
It never made her happy, but I bet that new Mercedes could
Ain't no bars, but niggas can't escape the hood
And it took so many of my niggas that I should hate the hood
But it's real niggas like me that make the hood
Ridin' slow in that Phantom just the way I should
With the top back, in my Sox hat
I'm paid in full, the nigga Alpo couldn't stop that
Even if they brought the nigga Pac back
I'd still keep this motherfucker cocked back

And I'm grindin' till I'm tired
‘Cause they said: ""You ain't grindin' till you tired.""
So I'm grindin' with my eyes wide

Fresh like, uhh, Impala, uhh
Chrome hydraulics, 808, drums
You don't want, none, nigga better, run
When beef is on, I'll pop that, trunk
Come get, some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air, Ones
It's red-rum, ready, here it come
Compton, uhh, Dre found me in the slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin' ""Uhhhh!""
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have, fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress like, uhh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front in case a nigga wanna stunt
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I put Lamborghini doors on that Escalade
Low pro, so low look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year mayne, a nigga so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (ahh!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You're now rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, Teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, 'cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
'Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass

Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker crunk
It took two months but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, ""Huh?""
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk get your fuckin' head lumped

She got on tights with the leather skin
She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
Girl shaped like a coke bottle, Medellín
In love with her 'til she went and let the devil in
She pop pills like medicine
She probably gon' die, it's startin' to be evident
I told her, ""Slow down, girl you're heaven-sent""
I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kev and them
And I can't let this girl throw her life away
Kick her dorm room in and told her put the knife away
Took her to the hospital like right away
She a angel with demons, the girl like night and day
Stressed out, parents getting divorced
Girl love 'em both, she ain't tryin' to sit in court
She a square so it's hard to see the angle
And that's why God gave her an guardian angel
It's me, and I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
Last nigga got her caught up in the airport
She ain't had no pride, so she went and did a year for him
She a ride-or-die, like Eve and them
Make home-cooked meals every evening
Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
Love life like Joselin and Stevie and them
Am I wrong for being the best that I can to her?
Takin' her son and tryin' to be a man to him
She don't wanna pray, but I told her put her hands to it
I done came a long way from that tan Buick
Yeah, grandmother would be proud of me
Almost got the devil all the way the fuck out of me
Remember momma knockin' on the door hounding me
Bought her a car and a crib even though she doubted me
[Interlude: Game & JMSN]
(When I wake up every day) Even though she doubted me
(I thank the Lord that we are safe) Even though she doubted me
(Again, yeah) Even though she doubted me
That's why you should pray for me
That's my momma and I love her with my heart like I love you
If you strugglin', baby daddy ain't takin' care of the kids
Girl, you can get a hug too
I'm here whenever you need me, gon' reach out, it's that easy
I love women, cause without women
Wouldn't none of us niggas be breathin'

Good girl at heart, I remember you well, I remember you well
Got a husband and kid, but I flirt
Hope you do a little dirt cause I'm diggin' you still
That's real, but nah, you don't text back
And deep down I respect that
Cause even though a nigga wanna tap that shit
I don't wanna be the one to wreck that shit
So, so I fall back, year go by, I got more plaques
Just to get a call from you tellin' me you miss me
And you wanna see me next time the tour's back
Damn, well what changed then?
She tellin' me a nigga had her caged in
Every time she think about me on the road
She be cryin' realizin' all the places that she ain't been
Well it's cool, I'll pick you up, hold you down, lift you up
These other niggas try and fuck
I'm the only one who cut and still came back to stitch you up
So we fuck, say what?
You ain't been home lately, you ain't heard that nigga?
Her man left cause she cheated on his ass
Found her pills in a bag, yo, she burned that nigga

Dawg, she burned that nigga
He beat her ass in the crib then he went and did a bid
All cause a bitch burned that nigga
Now dawg, that's real ass shit
That's word around the ville ass shit
Did you strap up? Did you the strap up?

I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: Nigga Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me
I watched the death of a dynasty, so I told Vibe Magazine
Workin' with Dr. Dre was a (""Dream"")
I had visions of makin' a classic, then my world turned black
Like I was starin' out of Stevie Wonder's glasses
It's kinda hard to imagine, like Kanye West
Coming back from his fatal accident to beatmakin' and rappin'
But, we the future, Whitney Houston told me that
It's gon' take more than a bullet in the heart to hold me back

I had dreams of fuckin' a R&B bitch like Mýa
When I saw that ass on the front of that King
Read the article in the magazine, she loved gangsters, loved nasty things
So I'm in the glass house having nasty dreams
Good girls never give it up
But anything is possible, if 50 fucked Vivica
Hurdled life's obstacles, found my way through the maze
Then joy turned to pain like Frankie Beverly and Maze
Used to dream of being Unsigned Hype
'Til I was crushed by Dave Mays, almost let my pen fall asleep on the page
Daydreamin' yesterday, dozin' off backstage
I thought I saw Eazy talking to Jam Master Jay
So I walked over, heard Jam Master say
""It's a hard knock life, then you pass away""
They say sleep is the cousin of death, so my eyes wide open
'Cause a dream is kin to your last breath

The dream of Huey Newton, that's what I'm livin' through
The dream of Eric Wright, that's what I'm givin' you
Who walked through the White House without a business suit
Compton hat, jheri curl drippin' on Ronald Reagan's shoes
Gave Mike Lem my demo, came here to pay my dues
Started off with Whoo Kid, then I start blazin' Clue
It was all a dream like Big said it'd be
Don't sleep on me homey, I bring nightmares to reality
Rap phenomenon, defyin' the rules of gravity
Studied all the classics, start revisin' my strategy
'Cause Marshall Mathers made it, Curtis Jackson made it
Head in the clouds, wonderin' where the hell Marvin Gaye went
How do I say this? I'm livin' for my son
But I can't figure out, why I'm at my temple with this gun
Wake up to a Jesus piece, like a Catholic nun
The war to be a rap legend has just begun

Blushin' in this 40 ounce, lettin' the ink from my pen bleed

I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck
All eyes on you
[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Lookin' at me like you love me
We can do it now or later
She wan' lick on party favorite
On my wave, tryna surf it up
Know we gettin' gnarly, smokin' Marley, burnin' up
Certified with the double-M pullin' up
Tooly got a room, we'll play ""Room Up In Here"", been here
Girl, you know my intentions
I put you on the wall like a picture
Round after round to decisions
Say you wanna show me what I'm missin'
All the lights low, but we lit up
I don't let you down if I get up
Like you got a man, but you're fed up
But you know when we get together
[Collision: The Game]
You want me to say your name, huh?
Karrueche!

[Chorus: Jeremih]
All eyes on me
I need your attention
Put your body on me
You the one I'm missin'
All eyes on me
I don't want your love
We ain't gotta fake it
We both tryna fuck

[Hook]
These niggas ain't bigger than me
These niggas ain't Nas, ain't Jigga to me
These niggas ain't Em, they ain't 50 to me
You ain't Pun, you ain't Pac, you ain't Biggie to me
These niggas ain't Crips, they ain't 60's to me
These niggas ain't Bloods, they ain't dripping with me
Niggas talking that shit 'bout a new generation, man
Fuck these niggas, I'll slash your fucking faces

[Verse 1]
You niggas ain't sold shit, not an album or a rock
Pussy nigga putting rings on my old bitch
Dick down the throat ass niggas, old ho' ass niggas
Happy 'cause you went gold ass niggas
These niggas ain't spitting with me, you ain't sicker than me
Fuck out my section, you ain't sitting with me
This for very important people, it's clear that we not equal
Clear you niggas faggots, I'm the black Marshall Mathers
Like ""ying, ying, ying"" on a motherfucker
Who needs Hulk Hogan when you got Sting on this motherfucker?
Less than five albums, Kiss the Ring on this motherfucker
California throne and I'm the King on this motherfucker
I don't wanna hear it – weak ass lyrics
Crying on the hook, thinking we gon' feel it
Old lost ass niggas, voice crack when you talk ass nigga
Rolling blunts for the boss ass niggas
I came in with 'Ye, Jeezy and boss ass niggas
Your Freshman cover a whole bunch of soft ass niggas
Tampon lyricists, evacuate the premises
Mute BET cyphers cause I don't wanna hear that shit
May you rest in piss, you fuck niggas
Ayy Frank Ocean, go ahead and fuck these fuck niggas
(Yeah, they fuck niggas) Ain't no 3 Stacks in your class
Take your Top 10 spot and shove it up your ass, bitch boy
[Bridge]
Niggas already fucked your bitch, you bitch boy
And every time you kiss on that ho you suck my dick, you bitch boy
And when you buy that ho a bag that bitch carry my bricks, you bitch boy

[Verse 2]
I was in the XXL, Red Chucks 'round my neck
I was the G in the Unit, had Buck round my set
Word to the Rhymes, had Busta Bus round my set
Gave Whoo Kid a Glock in case they bust round my set
I'm from Compton where that Glock can't fuck with that Tec
That's on Bompton, 40 Glocc got socked in his neck
This is Spawn in the flesh, you a pawn hit reset
Five in the chest, I'm Makaveli the Don in the vest
Don't say ""What's up"" when you see me, you a pussy nigga
Strangé, fake ass Kanye, fake ass Weezy
Fake ass jewelry, how I know? I'm at the pawn shop
Nigga better off jacking Flav for his alarm clock
Speaking of time, how much more 'til the Game drop
So you can suck my dick and Complex can count my name drops
I been the underdog, I'm cool in my dog house
Fuck all these pussys, give me any name to call out
Left Aftermath, Dre told me ball out
Stunna put me on a private jet then we balled out
Landed in Miami, met some bitches ate 'em all out
Black Marshall Mathers, time to show 'em what this saw about
""Ying, ying, ying"" on a motherfucker
""Ying, ying, ying"" on a motherfucker

These niggas ain't Nas, ain't Jigga to me

These niggas ain't Crips, they ain't 60's to me
These niggas ain't Bloods, they ain't dripping with me
Niggas talking that shit, 'bout a new generation
Old emoji ass rappers, all their smiley ass faces
Fuck niggas

Ayy, Frank Ocean go ahead and fuck these fuck niggas
Yeah, they fuck niggas
""Ying, ying, ying"" on a motherfucker
""Ying, ying, ying"" on a motherfucker
""Ying, ying, ying"" on a motherfucker
""Ying, ying, ying"" on a motherfucker
Drop your single, I drop ""Dreams"" on that motherfucker

Bitch, I want my mother fuckin' money back
You only gave me five dollars!
I gave you twenty mother fuckin' dollars!
No, you didn't! You only gave me five dollars!
No, I gave you twenty and I ain't gon' sit here and argue with your flat-ass face, home girl
This is America!
You know, that's the thing about you mother fuckers
Go home!
I ain't goin' no where 'til I get my mother fuckin' change
I will blow this mother fucker up if I don't get my mother fuckin' change
*Speaking Japanese*
*Mocking Japanese*
I want my mother fuckin' change!

[Verse 1]
What happened in hip-hop that got Pac and Big shot?
The thicks blocks, now every rapper claim he let his clip pop
But even myself tote a gun, and know to run than get shot
I've been there before now I'm fuckin' with Doc
(Dr. Dre: Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
If not, I pitch rocks, anticipatin' my incarceration
Media think I'm fakin' like Mason, but when it comes to mace
Fuck R. Kelly, I don't take it in the face
I find out who sprayed it, and I'm puttin' you under the pavement
No Buddhist priest, Catholic, or Baptist pastor can save him
I'm far from religious, but I got beliefs
So I put canary yellow diamonds in my Jesus piece
I came back from the dead without a part of my chest
Laid in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
I waited for 3 years while everybody else dropped
Now I understand why Nas did a song with his pops
[Chorus]
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary
Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary

[Verse 2]
If I die my niggas
Fuck it, I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
Got a hook from Faith, no verse from Jay
I guess on Westside Story he thought I spit in his face
Told Ed Lover & Moni Love I was talkin' to Ja
With that Maybach line, it was payback time
Keep fuckin' with me nigga, I'll put you under me
Take your car and trade it in for eight 3 hundred C's
If you cross my T, I'll dot your eyes
You'll do life in a cemetery, I'll do mine with Shyne
Come home sit in the throne with my legs crossed
And my Air Forces, middle finger up, fuck the world
'Cause I'm feelin' like Puff when Life After Death hit
Mo' money, mo' problems and I lost my best friend
I'm the second dopest nigga from Compton you'll ever hear
The first nigga only put out albums every 7 years
[Interlude: Radio Interview]
(You know what speaking of Jay
That just makes me roll down
Now your song Westside Story)
Uh Oh
(You got a line that says
""I don't do button up shirts
Or drive Maybachs""
Is that a shot at Jay?)
Nah, I was talkin' about Ja Rule
Yeah, so, I mean, I just-I-I got a lot of respect for Jay
You know what I'm sayin'?
I never take shots at legends
I just-that's just somethin' I don't do

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you why I do this shit
I'm a son of a gun 'cause moms was a Hoover Crip
First day I got signed, I had to prove I spit
Freestyle with Busta Rhymes (Busta: son, duke is sick)
The protégé of Doc Dre, I could finally put the shoes on
Now that the rumors of Rakim and Cube gone
They say truth hurts, sunk like quicksand
Don't stop me in traffic and ask about Hittman
I gotta restore the feelin' that crawled from under the rock
After Tha Dogg Pound crushed the buildings
I got a family to feed, I'm the middle of 9 children
We can talk about a loan after I sell 5 million
If I tell you I ain't Game and I don't know Dre
You goin' do me like Xzibit and cut half my face?
I take all the credit for puttin' the West back on the map
If you ain't feelin' that, guess I'm Guerrilla Black
[Chorus]
I'm Ready To Die without a Reasonable Doubt
Smoke Chronic and hit it Doggystyle before I go out
Until they sign my Death Certificate, All Eyez On Me
I'm still at it, Illmatic, and that's The Documentary

You know I love you like cooked food, I'm a good dude
Let's hit the Roscoe's on Pico, I'm in a hood mood
I'm sittin' here thinkin' 'bout all the things I could do
So what you should do is play your position for Birkin bags
We poppin' tags, her shoe game sick
We drinkin' Ace out of red bottles, true gang shit
Fuck with me and you're famous
Kanye'd my bitch, now she’s away from the nameless
Camera flashes from strangers, turn a Range to a manger
Jesus piece on the plates, yeah my baby an angel
Fell straight up out of Heaven into what we into
Who knew we'd grew into, whatever we into
That's too much for your mental, so we snapback that
Game on point like the stripes on my Gucc backpack
My ladybug, yea she cool like that
In them Trues, why you move like that

[Chorus: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that
My lady got me going
I'm where she already knows
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that
[Verse 2: Lil’ Wayne]
Uh, you my lady
And that pussy feel like a haven
We can make babies, let's be creative
She say leave them tricks alone but I’m a skater
I love her like her daddy told her no man would
I got a lot of bad bitches, she the only one good
I get her flowers for nothing, she smiling and blushing
If I don't answer my phone, then we probably fucking, and yeah
She love my tattoos
Ain't got no room for her name but I'ma make room
She let her hair down, we have a stare down
She said ""I'm glad you ate it,"" where my cap & gown?
Told her, ""I can be your chauffeur"", dick like a limo
Multiple orgasms, that’s my M.O., haha
Redbone pretty
I kiss her from her titty to her clitty, Tunechi

[Chorus: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that

I'm where she already knows
She know she can get

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Sean Don, whoa
Look, my girl's sweet like my hotel floor
From where they ran through more keys than a hotel door
The D, give her the D now the whole hotel know
Feel like I'm looking down from Heaven
Screaming, ""Oh, Hell no!""
When you hop on top, girl, that's what it feel like
She always had a player back like them field lights
And every time I left it ain't feel right
Cheated on her and she stayed, that's just real life (shit)
Cause it's hard when you ain't on the same coast
Burning bread in the club so all these girls want toast
Hoes try and wade but we ain't on the same boat
They trying to sink everything that we made float
She told me 'bout her ex man, her old boy stories
And how she had a dildo, you know, toy stories
Don't fuck her on her period, ain't into horror stories
I take her to my favorite restaurant, she order for me
'Cause she know me

[Chorus: Jeremih]
You know my lady always on
She know I need it so
She know she can get
All that, all that, all that, all that, all that

I'm where she already knows

This that sick rap, kick back, come to where I pitch at
Where bitches love The Game like Tyson Beckford six pack
Presidential Rollie, nigga, where your wrist at?
I can kill you in four bars, that's a Kit Kat
Did the Lambo my way with a sick wrap
Smooth as Frank Sinatra with a motherfucking slick back
No rats in my pack, ain't no wrinkles in my slacks
Counting singles in my Shaqs, stacking Pringles from the crack
Nigga I was on the bus with it
Had 12 stuck to my chest in the field with the colt
Andrew Luck with it
We had the rock, hit the block like what's up with it
Jay was in the Z, my young gunnas in the truck with it
Sigel would've loved it, Philly would've fucked with it
California state property you niggas stuck with it
Brrrring, sold Peedi Crakk
Game was on the block in his beanie with a Mac
I'm what you rap niggas 'fraid of
A Compton nigga that could go bar for bar with Jada
Let me tell you who suck, like banana Now or Laters
Blac Chyna head the bomb, al-Qaeda
Listen, you want beef I'll cater
Game snap on everything he like a fucking wild gator
Silver and black Ghost, nigga that's Al Davis
Give me Left Eye back, take Fetty Wap and the Raiders
The Rams is back, them bullets getting tossed
16 on your back like you fucking Jeff Goff
Your man acting girly too put 30 on his chest
Kanye shrug bitch, welcome to the west
YG, Nipsey, and Kendrick yea check
Shout 'em out I just do it like a fucking Nike rep
Bentley truck Chuck, with the Henny cupped up
Don't get me fucked up, you see the semi tucked, duck
Pass the Goose, where them duck ducks?
These hoes foaming at the mouth, they got Penny fucked up
I'm 'bout to poke 'em like a cactus
Told that bitch to roll the Philly for the game, and she talking about practice
The Maybach is A.I
Artificial intelligence motherfucker that's Junior Seau
All my doors suicide, I'm in Vegas shoot the five
Tell the dealer pay me don't be shy he ain't from Do or Die
Now do you wanna ride, back seat of my Caddy?
Used to flip them pies ain't no relation to Patti
And I move Ps, ain't no relation to Swaggy
Before that it was missing teeth and nickel sack baggies
That's caine, no daddy cause I ain't really have one
And you can't call yourself dope if you ain't never bag none
I'm the old DMX you niggas Drag-On
Game raw as fuck like poking holes in the Magnum
Used to ether the niggas in all of my 16s
Now I scare 'em once a year like I'm fucking Halloween
This ain't a dream, nigga hurricane a nightmare
Stab you in your sleep and smack your baby out his highchair
Your daddy was a bitch, I had to do it
I ain't need no ski mask to do it
Murder is Rihanna and I'm attracted to it
Name a state, I'll send a package through it
If the fed hack into it, they get bossed on like I'm Massachusetts Huh!
Sitting in this Maybach with music
Your head is like Mustard beat and I'll put the ratchet to it
PARTY sent my jackas to it
Drama bring the Mac into it
And this scope will get your mouth washed when I attach it to it
Gold on my neck, I make your bitch put her back into it
Usain Bolt if you bring a real track into it
Another classic moving the way to Aftermath to do it
Dre had the Chronic all I did was put the matches to it
Traffic moving backwards through it
Ever since I had the Buick
Known for putting cheese on niggas heads the way the Packers do it
And I had the yay, yea I brought crack to music
Every situation in rap, I've been a savage through it
And all these hoes getting mad cause I'm smashing through 'em
They can get a ring one day, if the Cavs can do it
Be LeBron bitch, I'm Jayceon bitch
Who else you seen parked at the swap meet in James Bond shit?
Another foreign car driven by a convict
Aventador matte black Akon lips
Nas ether niggas, Game napalm shit
Niggas say my name I pop up like the State Farm bitch
No nigga can see me, on or off TV
Gum bottom Yeezys, I'm the 6' 5"" Eazy
Lightskin bitches be mad and talking greasy
I'ma start fucking them Dej Loafs and Dreezy's
I'ma start beefing with Cole, Drizzy and Cornrow Kenny
Or you could pick your favorite rapper, and he gon' be pouring out Henny
I got a bitch from Minne-Apolis pack a semi
Bang the ratchet at Denny's and fly herself back to Philly
She got a couple mill and she don't even know Meek
And ever since that nigga snitched on me we just don't speak
See that shit you got with Drake is like a slow leak
Blood'll be dripping like Niagara if I poke Meek
Nicki won't get no sleep, I'm coming through at 4 a.m
Four deep, to leave his dead body on the soaked sheets
It could happen lowkey
You better have Ross call me or you gon' be eye level with a roach feet
This ain't a diss, nigga
This is all lives matter except this nigga's
[Outro: The Game]
This 1992 shit ain't no new shit
We in that all black you won't know who Blood and who Crip
With guns big enough to sink a fucking cruise ship
Fuck around and be a news clip with them loose lips
My nigga Drizzy packed you out and you ain't do shit
This the Golden State and my shooters ain't on no hoop shit
Nigga, you know that I'll snap you like a toothpick
And snitching on niggas ain't never been no cool shit
And I've been wanting to give Nicki this pool stick
So tell your lil' vivrant thing come fuck with Q-Tip

I don't read the XXL
Tote a .45 at the church, think I'm destined for hell, oh well
Blood tears off the face of my Jesus Piece
It's bloodshed, feel the cracks in my city streets
I'm from the crack of them city streets
Used to sell crack in them city streets, born in Blood, nigga
In a coma five days, life of a thug nigga
Momma ain't show, grandma almost pulled the plug nigga
Used to pull the gun out, just because of cuz niggas
Five shots to the head 'cause I'm a Blood nigga
Nuttin' brewing but suwoo'ing where the fuck I'm from
You lucky if you make it out of Compton, ask Andre Young
Smell the scent of dead bodies ridin' down Green Leaf
No peace so don't get caught up with no piece
Fuck Fatburger, we cooking that real beef
Mommas mourning they sons, I'm talking real grief
Real funerals of them lost Juveniles
Trying to be generals, be missing your dinner now, huh
Say its a blessing when you die in ya sleep
'Cause the coroner don't need no sheets, capisce?
I'm sayin', stop playing, wrap him up in what he lay in
Fold a nigga arms, now a casket what he pray in
Compton streets raised me
Can't tell my grandma nothing 'bout her baby, you crazy

I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'ma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I live this life at a pace that anyone can go
Know your place and dedicate your role, to the faith that you'll die alone
Trace your steps when I do step in a fire of broken bones
And I require my heart's desire and when I reap what I sow
I bought my momma a Benz, my boobie a Jag
A car for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
But still I be feeling like none of my light never casts
Out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
But fuck that, I'm not worried, even when it's scary
Skrrt off makin' them hurt off I should have hurt them in a hurry
Dirt off all under my fingers, dirt all of 'em gon is gone is burried
Shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
I need you to keep quiet as a mouse
Which is ironic 'cause rats is what I'm talking about
I'm hearin the sonics of gun fire
The whispers, the silent cries
Even though I know it's an eye for an eye
[Chorus: Tank]
I said she see no evil, she don't hear nothing at all
You want to see tomorrow, you promise not to talk
Say we on our way now, I'mma see you again
And when they ask you questions, you just answer
What happened then? What happened then?

I was born a soldier, ride or die for mine
Tattooed tears and a lawyer, tried to give me life
Heaven can you hear me? 'Cause I know that hell can
So heaven can you heal me? I'm only just a man, oh

You want to go to Compton? Nigga I'll take you there
Hub City bodies get burnt butt-naked here
Respect the code, a nigga's calling from the pen
Colombian neck-ties on the outside from within
And then, your momma never see you again
Casket to never wake up plastered in MAC make-up, huh
Niggas can’t hear you talking from the sky
And only five year olds see your ghost when you die, no lie
Karma catches up to all you head honchos
2 dome shots in that head, Griselda Blanco
Shit get real though inside the Foxhills though
Nigga living that fast life and get killed slow
Ask Wack and Draws if a nigga run the streets
My grandmother’s prayers saved you niggas I never wanted peace

Welcome to the West, and this ain't The Life of Pablo
Stay on that bullshit it's gon' start to feel like Chicago
Keep it one hunnid, you Nicki Minaj sideshow
Still chasin' dreams, I made ""Dreams"" in '05 though
Ridin' around, 10 Cam Newtons in the Tahoe
And when we touch down everybody catchin' spirals
Dressed in all black like the Panthers

You ain't got the answers, man! You ain't got the answers! (Kanye…) You ain't got the answers! You ain't got the answers, Sway! I've been doin' this more than you!

You shoulda went and got A.I., left Beans in rehab

Yeah, take Beans back to rehab
On Instagram lookin' like a mothafuckin' bean bag
Flyin' through Philly on them Wocky sticks
Punk-ass nigga, I'll beat you with a hockey stick
The nigga Hov gave you the game, you ain't soak it
You was s'posed to throw up the Roc, not smoke it
Talkin' you gon' be in L.A. in three hours
It's a 5-hour flight, put this bum in the shower
Pussy, I'm not a rookie, akhi, don't push me
Strapped, Ninja Turtles, nigga's runnin' with a rat
Now Tak tell 'em how you coppin' pleas on the jack
Fuck runnin' in the game, you gon' be runnin' into Wack
You jumped Quentin Miller and now you don't scrap
It was time to go at Drizzy and now you don't rap
Ask your bitch, she know I beez in the trap
You gotta move out of L.A., I'll put them Bs on your back
And Barbie keep her thumb in your butt
That Ken doll love gettin' fucked
Hide behind your niggas, you ain't got the guts
Ridin' dirt bikes with your ass on some nuts
Now you can pop a wheelie to that!
I went from B-more to New York to Philly and back
It's a lot of cheese at stake, this nigga really a rat
I fuck with Philly, but this nigga make y'all city look wack
And that's on Piru, yeah, I put the P on that hat
You get hit with the Eagle, roll a Philly to that
Now tell the world how you got your bitch
You FaceTimed Nicki while Safaree was fuckin' a chick
You ain't shit but a rat to me, a snake that don't rattle me
Lil' homie won't scrap with me, time to body his faculty
I'm in traffic, B, bumpin' this old Cassidy
Meesha's another casualty, fuckin' with me's a tragedy
The louder your scream, the wacker the verse
I put that dick chaser logo on the back of your hearse
They say the meek shall inherit the Earth
So I went and dug your ass up, 'cause Drizzy buried you first
And why you tryna pick on Wale?
You told me that you don't fuck with Rozay
And YG can't give you a pass
I add 20 to your 40s, put the 60s on your ass
And don't try to whine to the Grapes
You not the Rams, don't come back to L.A
I fuck around and catch an Uber to Slay
I'm a drama king, and a street sweeper with a K
Nigga, this is 2Pac mixed with the old Guwop
15 years, 30 mil', nigga, who flopped?
One good song, but you ain't got a classic yet
Bought your first album, ain't took it out the plastic yet
Move from Philly to L.A. and think he Fresh Prince
Sean Kingston got robbed and now you niggas best friends
Fat sloppy Twinkie eatin' ass nigga
You ain't got no pass, nigga, I'ma beat your ass, nigga
Jelly bean smugglin' fuck-ass nigga
I'll get some clippers and cut your mama's mustache, nigga
Fuck your sister while you watch 'cause she's kinda thick
And make that bitch take a knee, like Colin Kaepernick
Now back to Squeak Milly, Meeky Mouse
You gon' fuck around, get tied up inside Nicki house
I got esés on Beaumont, posted like Cousins
Waiting for the word to pump it up, like Joe Buddens
Thou shall not fuck with Chuck, pawns are stuck
Fold you up in boxes; Armani tux
Louie sweats, armor tucked
Night night, use that pillow like a silencer, from dawn to dusk
Get at me, you niggas gon' see me in gloves
Or see me in clubs with ""Summer Sixteen"" in the snub
Lying on the Internet like you ain't talking to twelve
Got the cops at my door, like they dropping off mail
I seen that fake paperwork on XXL
Rat niggas chew through walls and leave you in cells
Before you see me in jail, you will see me in hell
You went and got the whole Philly, it's just me by myself
I could have went and got Kendrick, went and got Snoop
Went and got Nipsey, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q
Could have went and got E-40, brought Ice Cube back
And have Dr. Dre screaming ""Meek Mill is a rat""
It's a wrap, red khakis, red Cincinnati
I'ma see you in the streets, don't at me
You like a boat with a hole you can't sail
Meek Mill, me and Drake gave you them two Ls
(Ooouuu, Ooouuu, Ooouuu)
When these rats start snitching, break 'em off!
(Ooouuu, Ooouuu, Ooouuu)
When these rats start snitching, break 'em off!
[Omelly]
Pussy nigga! (Mumbles)
I got on gold headphones, gold chain
Gold on my wrist, aim (Mumbles)
If you ain't getting money, boy, you lame

Tell 'em pray for me
It was God that brought Dre to me
Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
Bless - but them niggas shot Big
Made a nigga feel ashamed of the the city where he live
Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
Thinking back to that Bimmer, wish my nigga Pac was strapped
But I'm dreaming Las Vegas Boulevard, Afeni's son's bullet scars
Everybody king of Diamonds until the feds pull they cards
Not the deck though
Hip-hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface, and Esco
Memoirs of the gold chain
It's a cold game nigga, Johnny Coltrane
Black Versaces with the gold frame
Nigga said he sold 'caine that's a bold claim
14 had a brain that could throw flames
So strange, have to blow they mind, Cobain

[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
[Verse 2: Game]
That's the crack music, nigga
Never spit a verse cause I was making trap music, nigga
I'm not an army, I'm a movement
The flow is water, Andre tried to Ice Cube him
Ice Cubin', roof translucent
Chick on my side tryna get my Trues loose
When I'm talkin' 'bout God, she 'posed to bow her head
Now she all on the blog, steady postin' 'bout her head
Got me thinking like a father, is the world safe?
Got me clinging to my daughter like shark fins in water
Rocks in my ears sunk the Titanic
This is my life and it's exactly how I planned it, damn it
God says everything happens for a reason
I seen four seasons at The Four Seasons
Take that chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
Cookin' up in the same pot they ain't got to pee in

[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah
Me and 'Ye killing (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Lord willin', I see a billion
'Til then, I let my nuts hang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
Throw them suicide doors up
And let that Holy Ghost swang (Something like my Jesus piece, hah)
[Verse 3: Common]
Pieces on gold leashes
Cruisers, around greases make them cohesive
I'm the sun shining with God features
Draw closer to a true blood bleeder, soul of a southern preacher
Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
We throw the peace up, knowing that the world need us
Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
To sacrifices we made it's sorta Christ-like
At the after party thinking what the afterlife's like
He paid for our sins, is it really priced right?
Fuck it, I see the light, broads, they see the light
Can't deny my Jesus piece that’s so Peter-like
Chicks crow for dough, get low for mo'
A convo piece, she end up at the condo
Another Jane Doe or a golden angel
Pendant on an angle, watch the chain glow

[Chorus: Game & Kanye West]
Mama forgive me cause I'm tryna make a living, hah
Them niggas hatin' cause that Royce Phantom killing, hah
Niggas shining like they hanging from the ceiling, hah

Throw your muthafucking Cincinnati hats in the sky, nigga don’t ask why
Red laces in and out of them Air Max ’95's
I, walk on the moon, flow hotter than June
Any nigga want drama I kick up a sand dune
Peace to my man Tune for giving his man room
Now we hittin’ switches 'til the Spring Break, Cancun
Get it? Nah forget it, Soo Woo I live it
Made the letter B more famous than a Red Sox fitted
But that was suicide, I don’t live in Judas’ eyes
Half of these rappers weren’t trappin’ when I was choppin’ the do or die
Suge had me in, I went Puffy like Zab Judah eye
Dre called, told my baby momma “won’t you decide”
She chose Doc, first day I pulled dude a side
Like it's Aftermath for life and all I do is ride
Before I turn on ‘em I kill Satan
And stick my red flag in the ground it’s Red Nation

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Now Blood the fuck up
Every day’s a gamble muthafucka tough luck
And we gon' fuck the world 'til that bitch bust nuts
I can’t tell you what's good, but I can tell you what's what
And that’s, B’s up, hoes down
Lookin’ in the mirror, I’m nowhere to be found

Niggas’ll trade they soul to be Drake or J. Cole
Live and die for this shit, word to 2Pac Shakur’s halo
One blood, plural, nigga I’m spending Euros
Ferrari got an ice cream paint job, Dorrough
I’m up out the hood, where they pull guns on you like
Come up out ya hood, it ain't never all good
We roll up in backwoods, nigga get to actin’ stupid
Get thrown in the backwoods, Los Angeles
Home of the scandalous, pimp, hoes and gamblers
98 degrees on Christmas, nigga we rollin’ cannabis
Swisha sweet ain't it, I told her I’m Charles Louboutin
The bitch fainted, pulled her panties down, stain it
That’s my Chi-lingo, yeah I’m bi-lingual
Ball by myself, nigga, Ochocinco
Dancing with the stars, bullets and fast cars
And everybody bleed out here, word to God

Walk in the club saggin’ with a .38 Magnum
Red Ralph Laurens, the double R sittin’
On a hill like Lauren her and the car foreign
Got my red Dre Beats on, tryna put my peeps on
And I keep it hood like this Phantom is a Nissan
Where my nigga Jim Jones at? Roll up the weed son
So many bloods in Compton had to get a NYC song
And while I’m out here, I might as well go shopping

[Intro]
(Gunshot)
On and On
On and On
On and On
On and On
[Verse 1: The Game]
Back when Dot was hangin' out at Top's in the Benzo
Freestylin' to them Chronic instrumentals, no pens and pencils
I was out there Bloodin' like a menstrual
With a Backwood clinched between my dentals, way back when
When we was outside with the indo
Hotboxin' rentals in front of Centennial, remedial thoughts
Never thought that I would amount to shit
Smoke chronic, fuck bitches, ride around bouncin' shit
From Impalas to that Harley truck, to dishraggin' bitches
That was hard to fuck, I came up, it was hardly luck
Just left Compton, and I ain't have to use my AK
What a day, what a day
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Back when my driver's license, was baby faced and triflin'
I made my way through crisis, I made my tape
And recorded portraits in front of sirens, I made you hate the vibrant
You can't escape the tyrant, you can't relate where I've been
In '98 my problem, actin' too grown and shit
Cappin' at bitches, yeah my religion through songs and shit
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga, you are not the homie
Bitch I’m well-connected from my section down to Long Beach
Fumblin' with Tetris if your block neglectin' your ki
Everyday I wake up with my face up to my father
Makin' sure my heart is pure enough to grow my seed and harvest
All my king is stuffin', double up my plantation with dollar
Every dream is such reality, my déjà vu done caught up
Bitch I'm brought up with the homies, that's on me
24/7, Kendrick revvin' these cold streets
Don't we live by it, die by it, then reincarnate
And if Game told me, ""Drive by it,"" I raise AK
Ain't no shame on it, cry about it, fuck that, I'll play
Like no name on it, blindsided, ain't no one safe
Documentary had identities of where I'm from
Therefore my energy had to make sure the better me won
It ain't no better one, son, it ain't no tellin' me nothin'
Nigga that's Chuck, Doc Dre and K, the legacy's done, BLAOW!
[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh man, you thought these niggas with attitude would show gratitude
Fooled you
From 2015 to infinity it's still bomb weed and Hennessy
I can pimp a butterfly for the energy
Game I need acapella

[Verse 3: The Game]
There I go, give me a minute, nigga
'Bout to hit a home run, K. Dot, grab the pennant, nigga
Pin it on my Pendleton, trap late night, Jay Leno them
Got my mom a tennis bracelet, Wimbledon of Wilmington
Now can I rap for a minute? Black on the track for a minute
Look in my rhyme book, see murder like when I was a fan of No Limit
Ain't no gimmicks 'round here, this Compton, me, Doc and Kendrick
Chronic, good kid, my first year, 3 documentaries
Now I'm blockin' sentries, 16 Impalas
They bounce like they Iguodala
That's on my mama, niggas up and did me a solid
I put that on me, that's on me
You get a bullet fuckin' with the lil' homie
Thinkin' back then like fuck your rules, nigga this is Piru
Slide through with the Erykah Badu
West side Compton, nigga don't mind if I do
From Piru Street to my old street
Nigga this Compton, grew up on a dead end
Got an armful of dead friends
Round here Crips be sweatin' us niggas like a headband
Like what's up cuz
(Yo dawg where you from?)
No time to stop and think
Pull your strap before they do or you get shot before you blink
Straight outta Compton, 3 times I told you
The third time I said it with TDE mothafucka
I'll make you eat every letter
Spoonfeed you niggas like toddlers, from the city of Impalas
When shot callers take their pitbulls and feed them niggas rottweilers
My clip full, I quick pull, no more slangin' 8 balls on the corner
And all them niggas I used to freestyle with, I ate y'all on the corner
Call the coroner, niggas dead out here
Hangin' onto life by a thread out here
Them niggas wearin' all that red out here
P snapbacks on niggas heads out here
So don't you come fuckin' with the little homie
So OG they call me Tony
Montana, no French, my red bandana legit
My uncle told me before he died, ""Just keep your hand on the brick""
So I did
Sell every chicken that a nigga had in stock, yes I did
Walked to Compton, hot pocket full of rocks, yes I did
Skipped class, yes I did, whooped niggas ass, yes I did
Fucked a bitch behind the bleachers while on the rag, that's on Bloods
Westside, that's on Bloods, this TEC fly, that's on Bloods
You fuck with Dot, I'll let you choke on your blood
I put that...
[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
On me, that's on me
Raise up, nigga you are not the homie
On me, that's on me

Real nigga'll take a basic bitch, then close the trunk of that Maybach
Open the trunk to that Maybach, roll the bitch in that water
Conscience start gettin the best of you, gotta pull a ho outta that water
Try to make some sense of it, tell a ho she got baptized

[Verse: Game]
Six pounds of chronic on my grandma coffee table
That's how you remember it? That's how I remember it
Yeah, dip into the liquor store, nine in my khakis
Crips tryna get at me, my red Impala bumping like acne
My city a trap me; been shot, robbed, stabbed, chased home, socked out
Jabbed by esse's, cops, degenerate niggas with rags
Disintegrate niggas when enemy, dome shots like Kennedy
Slugs drippin' with Hennessey, got murderous tendencies
And if you don't know where the fuck they got me from
Martin Scorsese when I pull out my gun
Scarface, car chase, tell me how your blood taste
Ask your baby mama, she'll tell you how a Blood taste
Basket case, still I'm back with Dre, wait I never left
Run up in Beats, ""Bitch pass the safe! Compton""
Produced by a billion in this motherfucker
Still smokin', Dre we need a ceilin' in this motherfucker
Compton! They killin' in this motherfucker
They grillin' in this motherfucker
Lock the door, they stealin' in this motherfucker
No chains, no rings, this my home
Nigga, this Hub City, no-fly zone
Niggas pull out burners
Start breakin' like Turbo on Ozone
Crack fiends on the back streets
Where the tracks lean, where the needles lay
And switchblades, if you bitch made
Put chili all on your Frito Lay's
Where we dream of Montego Bay
But all we got is the swap meet
Where the cops meet, go bang bang
Leaves blood stains on that concrete
And I'm the only nigga bumpin' Mobb Deep
'Cause I mob deep down that side street
'Cause I'm a West side rider, live with gats on collars
Don't hate me, better get your dollars
I be on Rosecrans with a Glock in both hands
Leanin' on that Brougham
Flamed up like a Coke can with my name on it
[Outro: Asia Bryant]
Another day in Compton, the thrill is high
Know somebody's watchin', but I don't know why
Feel the fire burnin', it touches the sky
Feel 'em coming at you, I won't die tonight
So I get by, I get by
I get by, I get, I get by

[Verse 1: The Game]
I done been around the world, been around the block
Been around hoes that fucked Biggie and 'Pac
Like Vida Guerra, ass took her to the top
She'll give you some brain, you let her throw up the Roc
Let her put on your chain, she'll throw you some cot
Picture that, like Meagan Good and Jamie Foxx
Hype said it's a wrap, she still on the set
Puttin' oil on her legs like she Gloria Velez
She was Eye Candy in the XXL
Hopped off the page and on a skateboard with Pharrell
I knew she (Wouldn't get far) 'cause five hundred dollars
Can't get you that (Far), how you get that (Far)
And all these new video bitches tryin to be Melyssa Ford
But they don't know Melyssa Ford drive a Honda Accord
She a video vixen, but behind closed doors
She do whatever it take to get to the Grammy Awards, ha ha

[Chorus: The Game]
(You wouldn't get far), fuckin' them rap stars
You know who you are, put your hands up ladies
(You wouldn't get far), if you kept your legs closed

You know who you are, I wrote this song for you

Did I have under my belt, like boxers
Not to brag but, if it add up
One, two, nigga, that's mad nuts
Game, you mad nuts, how you gon' call out all these
Bitches knowin' damn well they gon' call me
The only dream, of that ghetto prom queen
Was to make it to the screen, maybe get seen
Maybe get chose by a nigga from my team
Head so good he don't ask for a pre... nup
Now ask yourself this question, umm
Would you be with Jay-Z if he wasn't C-E-O
Would you be with F-A-B-O if he drove a Neo
Would you ride with Ne-Yo, if he was in a Geo
Well why the hell you think these bitches comin' at me fo'
But since they all fall in my palm, I take a trio, yo

You know who you are, I wrote this song for you
For you baby, I'd find you, for you and you, for all y'all
[Verse 3: The Game]
I done had my share of bitches with long hair
Short do like Kelis or Halle in Boomerang, yeah
I been around the block in the Bentley drop top
In Miami Beach when Lil' Kim was fuckin with Scott
I got the scoop on Hoops, whatever the case
She'll let you spray in her face long as she Bathing Apes
And ain't nobody tryin' to take Beyonce from Jay
But I know a bitch named Superhead he fucked back in the day
The things niggas do when pussy sittin' on they face
Stabbed Un in the stomach
She must have had a pussy like Wonder Woman
On that superhero shit
Fly as Gabrielle Union in the back of my six, fo'
Impala, forget the double D's
I put 'em right in your face like that model bitch Toccara
And she ain't win the show but she ridin' in that Gallardo
That's why I fuck 'em today and forget 'em tomorrow

I mean damn, everywhere I look
Everywhere I go, I see the same hoes

Stepped off of that G6
Hit the club on that G shit
You see the belt, that's a G, bitch
And I'm 'bout to kill Chief Keef shit
Just killed my nigga Meek shit
Then I killed my nigga French shit
Got a French bitch, no friendship
And she givin' my dick a French kiss (Yeah)
A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like
Arm hangin' out the window
Of that black Ghost with them chrome pipes
Tell them niggas it's gon' be a long night
Bitches wanna chill, we gon' need some more ice (Ayy)
Shout out to John Wall, man, that nigga nice (Ayy)
Club leanin', nigga, we gon' need some more Sprite
Real nigga in these Ray-Bans
Fuck the judge, we don't take stands
Tape Feds, we don't shake hands
Put a gap in your mouth, Strahan (Ayy)
Hundred racks in these cargos
Push the button, these cars go (Ayy)
Six cradle that 'Lago
Six spades, black card ho
Got homies out in Chicago
With that full clip on that bullshit
Dang nigga, that's Rozay
Movin' packs on 'em in MJs (Ayy)
I got a thick bitch with a thin waist
Got a condo where somethin' slim stay (Ayy)
Got a Rolex Presidente
Got black diamonds, Kunta Kinte
Hot boy like Turk and them
Hot wheels, we swervin' them
Next year we gettin' Deron Williams
Gon' do LeBron like Dirk and them (Yeah)
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
A fuck nigga that's that shit I don't like
They throwin' bottles, I'm throwin' models
Just 'cause I give a bitch long pipe
Doin' shows on the soccer field, that's dome right
I be singin', he be singin' so it's on sight
But hol' up, I ain't give a nigga no green light
This head up, my bread up

Crip niggas, Blood niggas, eses, Asians
Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, white boys, Jamaicans
Latin Kings, Disciples, Vice Lords, Haitians
All these motherfuckers been patiently waitin'

[Verse 1: The Game]
Since the West Coast fell off, the streets been watching
The West Coast never fell off, I was 'sleep in Compton
Aftermath been here, the beats been knocking
Nate Dogg doing his thing, DPG still popping
I got ""California Love,"" fuckin' bitches to that 'Pac shit
And Westside Connection been had it locked, bitch
I'm in the rear-view, my guns is cocking
I put red dots on a nigga head like Rodman
All Stars, fat laces, gun charge, court cases
Fought that, not guilty, I'm back, niggas hate me
Been there, done that, sold crack, got jacked
Got shot, came back, jumped on Dre's back
Payback, homie, I'm bringing C.A. back
And I don't do button-up shirts or drive Maybachs
All you old record labels tryna advance
Aftermath bitch, take it like a motherfucking man

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game, tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high
Game tell 'em where you from (Nigga, Westside!)
[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm low-riding, homie, six-trey Impala
Gold Ds spinning, chrome hydraulics
Run up on my lo-lo, you stop breathing
Hollow tips make niggas disappear like Houdini
Gangbanging is real, homie, I'm living proof
Like Snoop Dogg C-walking on top of the Devil's roof
Rap critics wanna converse about this and that
'Cause red strings in his Converse, and this a Dre track
Keep gibbering and jabbing, I pull the .38 Magnum
And get to clickin' and clacking
Your homies wanna know what happened
Come to Compton, see Thriller like Mike Jackson
I might be Spike Lee of this gun clappin'
Prior to rapping, I was drug trafficking
In the dope spot, playing John Madden
Homie, I ain't bragging, I took five
You wanna die? Run up on that black 7-45

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die

[Verse 3: The Game]
New York, New York, big city of dreams
I got my L.A. Dodger fitted on, I'm doing my thing
Got me fucking with G-Unit, you know the drama that bring
I got niggas in Westside Compton and Southside Queens
And Buck told me in Cashville, I'm good when I come through
So I ain't gotta tuck in my chain like DJ Pooh
I'm gangsta—more like Deebo when he was Zeus
Play Bishop, I paint that picture, now, who got the juice?
You niggas is Nutso, I'll take off your roof
Leave your ass stretched out like a Cadillac coupe
God gotta let me in Heaven, all the shit I've been through
I was a O.G. in the hood before I turned twenty-two
Homie, I let the .38 special rip through that vest
And I don't contemplate whether not he left his shit on the dresser
Got Compton on my back, I'm starting to feel the pressure
I'm lyrically Kool G. Rap on these Dre records

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
If you take a look in my eyes
See I'll be a gangsta 'til I die
That California chronic got me so high

Since Big ain't here, I'm about to do it for T'yanna
And put roses on the grave of Kanye's mama
This for all the lost girls locked up in the pen
All the girls that hold it down, getting beat on by they man
Respect women, I don't care if they a 2 or a 10
We don't beat on Kat Stacks, we just bring it to an end
And we don't wanna see Nicki fighting Lil Kim
There’s missing women out there, let’s just focus on them
This song is dedicated to Natalee Holloway
I feel for her daddy so I wrote this on father's day
I know she gone, but she ain't far away
I just had a daughter, pass me that cigar 'Ye
I'm 'bout to tell a story, everybody parlay
Sit back listen while I kick it, the Compton Boulevard way
My daddy used to beat up on my mama all day
So I took my Chronic album and slept in the hallway
I learned this the hard way, when police came our way
My daddy had his act on like it never happened (Broadway)
Plus I was kinda scared to keep it real with you
Now my mama good, nigga she ain't gotta deal with ya
You want some money nigga? I ain't get a deal with ya
You ain't saying nothing, you like a still picture
You better thank God you still breathing air
Cause you coulda went out like your boy Steve McNair
[Hook]
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no (I won't)
If you don't, you gon’ really love us  (I said I won't)
Please don’t use us, dooon’t

[Verse 2: Drake]
Good evening, I'm in Chicago at the Elysian
With some girls that say they models but umm, I don't believe 'em
Who's still getting tested?
Where's all the women that still remember who they slept with?
Where's all the girls too busy studying to make the guest list
But when you do go out, you still working what you was blessed with?
Do it girl, I'll be the king to your Queen Latifah
I love your ass like Milhouse loved Lisa
I love your ass like the Ninja Turtles love pizza
Ironically enough, you something I want a piece of, you got it girl
This song remind me of Cat from Philly, a girl I used to love
Until she started acting silly, her heart's a little chilly
She a little too carefree
In 10 years, who's paying for all that therapy?
Umm, nigga not me, yeah
I'm probably not the man you take me for
But I bet I could be if you make me yours
Most of the shit I say is true
When I’m done with bad bitches, know I’m coming straight to you good girl

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't, you gon’ really love us
Please don’t use us, noo

Drizzy, I'm sitting here watching Basketball Wives
Like, ""uhh, them is basketball wives?""
Only cute one, Gloria, that's my nigga Matt Barnes' chick
Can't swim in that poon fool, that's a crucial conflict
Never sleep with the wife of niggas you eat with
And never buy a chick a bag on the first date
I pop a bottle with her on her birthday and tell her ass ""get on!""
Disrespect my chick, that type of shit'll get you spit on
I don't hit on girls, I just hit on girls
Like ""hey lil mama, come in Game and Drizzy's world""
Get busy girl, drink that rosé 'til you're dizzy girl
She walking around the club all lost, like where is he girl?
He on the top of the charts, next to Beyonce
Right under Kanye, so let the Don spray
That’s your girl? Nigga go on and make her cry
Soon as you do, I'm pulling up in that Porsche like ""let's ride""

Don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don't make the good girls go bad, no
If you don't make the good girls go bad, no
Don’t make the good girls go bad, no

Word on the news stand, Alicia got herself a man
And thats my nigga Swizzy, know you see Game and Drizzy

[Kid #1]
My mom took me to Sam Goody
I wanted to buy a 50 Cent CD
I took that shit home
That shit was wack like a motherfucker
I fuck with Game

[Kid #2]
I like 50 Cent
He reminds me SpongeBob
And Tony Yayo is Blue's Clues
And Lloyd Banks is Dora the Explorer
They're my friends
Psyche

[Kid #3]
I went down one of them bodega shits right there in Harlem
Got me a bootleg Lloyd Banks and Young Buck CD
Took that shit home, put it in my boombox
Thought I was 'bout to be on some Radio Raheem shit
Man that shit sound like some Vanessa Williams in '88
I mean Olivia cute but they say that bitch a man
So this Black Wall Street for life now
G-G-G-Unot!
[The Game]
300 Bars and Runnin'
Just loan me your ears for fifteen minutes
Walk with me
Here the breakdown
Pass the doja, .45 in the holster
Hollow tips'll fold 'em, them niggas, they toy soldiers
Oh, that boy colder than Hova unless he sober
Like I'm the president, but this ain't the Takeover
Now, there's the speaker, bring your ears a little closer
Before you call this a diss, and you make Hova pissed
Why would I wanna do that? When I'm just the new cat
That was taught if a nigga take shots to shoot back
Defending his yard, yeah, standing his ground
I'm saying if you gonna retire, then hand me the crown
Nah, let Bleek do it, then throw him a concert in Madison Square
Watch everybody sleep through it
We can go bar for bar, I'll let the lines speak to 'em
What they say? Bleek is over, let Chris and Neef do it
They say the wrong thing, I'ma smack 'em silly
What you thought? Them was the only niggas rapped in Philly?
See them niggas with the sunnis leave you wrapped in Philly
Then dash in groups like Beanie Mac in Philly
Cosmic Kev called, said Curtis Jack in Philly
Make a U-turn, I gotta go back to Philly
I forgot my cheesesteak, that's what I told the cops
So they wouldn't get the dogs start searching for the Glock
And I can't forget, B.I.G. got murdered by the cops
Even I was ready to die, when I heard that he was shot
What's beef? Beef is when I murk you on the spot
Labels signing anything, still searching for they Pac
I put purple on the block, so I don't feel threatened
When Ludacris say he coming for the number one spot
Ask 50, it get lonely on top, you can hate me
Or love me, but now the cops the only homies he got
When it's beef we eat, when we hear bologna, we pop
You sell records but a G-G-G-U-not
Acting big on the radio, to me you not
You can ask Mister Cee who hot
Tony Yayo, I bet 10 G's you flop
Run up on that new 300C you got
Stop hoping I fall, hope the bleeding stop
And I hope you blackout before you see the cops
I ain't High Top from Colors, I'm from Cedar Block
But what I got in my high tops'll make your breathing stop
I'm a gangsta slash rapper, check your CD shop
I'm like Elvis in there, they can't believe he dropped
Now I'm moving on up to George and Weezy's spot
I picked up where my homeboy Eazy stopped
I saw the west coast, put the shit on my back
Sprayed Aftermath on it, then loosened the straps
It get hot in here, let Lucifer rap
Bring hell to niggas when Dre producing a track
Take it to the streets, put the duece-duece to your hat
Then call the pigs, tell them the rooster is back
Call Jadakiss, tell him that duke is back
I'm still by your side, no matter who comes strapped
Fuck Lloyd Banks, it ain't about who could rap
It's about when the Ruger clap, is rufus back?
I see what you thinkin', you want me to die, is that so?
Now you left leaning back thanks to Fat Joe
We got reservations in heaven, you ready? Let's go
Drop them off, then pop Cristal with Esco
I'ma say he hit me first if me and Dre talk
All Nas said back was he had a braveheart
Now that's the eulogy, beefing is kinda foolish
See niggas running their mouth about what the fuck they gon' do to me
But quit the yapping before I proceed to clapping
And you gon' see the captain with plans of getting me captured
Even behind bars, I'm still gon' shine
I'm ten years younger than Yayo, I get out, I'm fine
Then I go right back, nigga, I pop minds
How you gon' drop Olivia? You only drop dimes
I knew you changed when you started sleeping in that vest, dawg
I don't need 50 Cent, my niggas make collect calls
1-800-split a faggot nigga wig
He got G-Unit wings, throw 'em off the Queens Bridge
Now your career is over-career is over
We in Q.B., banging C.N.N. in the rover
T-O-N-Y, that's Capone n' NORE
You ain't the talk of New York, your sixteens is boring
Take that shit off nigga, go back to PC
And tell 50 Cent to send you a copy of Beef 3
I'm airing their ass out on D-V-D
You wanna rhyme like Lloyd Banks, repeat after me
""I'm a G-Unit toy soldier on Sesame Street
Doing voice overs,"" bitch ass nigga
Need a rhyme dictionary to rehearse his lines
Sound like Oscar the Grouch with them nursery rhymes
We was in the studio when I first got signed
He got stuck, he called 50, tried to borrow some lines
That's the wrong nigga, when you need help with your rhyme
All he gon' tell you is say G-Unit one more time
Got mad 'cause I ain't wanna make your beef mine
You got lucky with Ja, why you ain't go at Shyne?
He freestyled from the pen, that's just the fact
Said he'd put you with your mom and you ain't fucked with that
Then you lied about your pops, he never bust no cap
Like father, like son, go ask Busta that
I knew from the beginning not to trust those cats
I'd kill 'em all if I could bring Justo back
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
I said
The underground is mine, I treat it like home
It's the reason niggas saying my name like Mike Jones
And I'm far from Houston but you can chop it and screw it
Do whatever to it, put it in the store, the shit moving
Gave 'em a hundred bars, they ain't think I could do it
Came with two hundred, nigga this is more than music
Even Dre knew it, that boy hot like summer
Both feet in the dirt, 300 Bars and Runnin'
I beef with any nigga, say my name, motherfucka, I'm gunnin'
You can put it on Skee if you want it
I'll air you out on Drama King, Mike, or Clue
And watch them shits sell out like a Air Jordan shoe
I told Funk Flex when I catch the nigga Whoo Kid
We gon' see if he know how to DJ with bruised ribs
Don't hit me on the Sidekick asking what you did
Get a gun or ask 50's police to use his
'Cause Bloods gonna get ya
Blood-Blood-Bloods gonna get ya for that Shadyville chain
That 380 spill brains, when I pop shots
Outside N.Y., in front of hip-hop cops
Or broad day in L.A., I'ma tell Em and Dre
This nigga bootlegging my music, ain't nothing for him to say
Took me off my own songs, then put it on his tapes
So I'ma take him out his house, put the beam on his face
Drop him off at Terror Squad, let him scream for the jakes
'Cause when you fucking with Jayceon, you can bleed in the lake
For caking off niggas on them CD's and tapes
Ask him to scratch a record, you will see that he is fake
If 50 was Puffy, you'd run and go get him a cheesecake
Take the DJ off your name, Mr. Instant Replay
Now the instant replay, I mean the machine
That G-Unit use every time 50 on stage singing like
""Bitches only feel your shit just a lil' bit
Niggas only feel your shit just a lil' bit""
On my album, 50 helped me just a lil' bit
Only on two songs, now back to some killer shit
My clips bananas, I kill a gorilla quick
Beating on your chest, I see to your death, yep
Tell Ecko to make him a suit
Tell Reebok to make him some boots, get him a head band
To cover the holes in his head, he a dead man
For thinking he can walk through muddy waters like Redman
Banks blacked out and let the gun blam
Without a M-E-T-H-O-D Man
So the lieutenant gotta ask for his strings
Take my advice, never wear Air Max to the bing
Unless you one of the Bloods or a Latin King
'Cause if you left with the Aryans your ass'll sting
And your cellmate is a 25 to lifer
They'll stab you in Folsom, then fuck you on Rikers
And life goes on
Now back to the coward of the hour, who lied and said he write my songs
He told Vibe Dre was gonna leave me on the shelf
So he gave me all his hits, you should've kept them for yourself
Nigga stop acting tough before I stand over you
Show you how The Documentary live on top of The Massacre
Make a move, I'm blasting, add those to the last ones
Ten shots from the MAC, empty the rest in the passenger
Fase yelling that's enough, let the coroner bag him up
Throw in Makaveli and lift the doors on the Maganum
Gun smoking, Fase think I'm locin' backing up
Reverse the '05 hearse on 41st and traffic, what
Hip-hop cops on my left, but I pass 'em up
The Dodge got a Hemi in it, Game got Remy in 'em
In and out of lanes like a New York cab
I miss the old king that New York had
Who's this fake nigga on pictures with the Jake nigga?
Got his crew starving 'cause he ate the whole cake, nigga
He ain't Nas, ain't B.I.G., ain't Jigga
If he ain't Cube or Pac then who you got?
We getting tired of you talkin about who you shot
I'll use another six bars to tell you who you not
You ain't 50 Cent, he went out like a gangsta
You went out with Vivica, three months after Wanksta
Get Rich or Die Tryin, we thought you was hot
Now the same nigga wanna take us to the Candy Shop
C'mon man, what happened to the thug?
Now you could find in the club, him and Lloyd Banks hugging
Nigga got mad when The Game start buzzing
So fuck making friends now I'm into throwing slugs
Olivia talking about we a family, Game had to go
Nigga, I'll smack that hoe like I'm Jackie-O
'Cause I don't wanna be cool, I don't wanna be you
I don't wanna shake hands or wear your G-Unit shoes
Don't want you on my hooks, don't wanna be in your group
Just wanna sit here and wait (for the summer)
To be gone, so I can head back to the block
Fresh white Nike Airs and the matching Sox fitted
Pull the brim low, if they don't get it
Bentley Coup on gold Daytons, I was the first one with it
Four times platinum, I done been there and did it
Came in the game and shitted, then wiped my ass with it
They say the Lord giveth, Lord take it away
So I build a house on top of Hip-Hop, I'll wait for the day
Niggas hating on me, they don't want Jayceon to play
And the D.A. waiting on Jayceon to make a mistake
So they can put me in the squad car and lock me away
Give me a odd job in the pen for minimal pay
Let me out so I can drive down criminal way
Pushing the rock, nah, this ain't no subliminal, Jay
The summer too hot and I just want the winter to stay
'Cause I'm a cold nigga when I put the pen to the page
Similar to them shells going into my gauge
I hand 'em off to Dre, he turned them into grenades
And Just Blaze, 'cause the boy got game
Like I close my eyes, and woke up in a Roc chain
Now back to reality, my gun and my vest
And if diamonds are forever, then I'm Kanye West
Take a look at my chest, a hundred thou wet Jacob
Whole crew got chains, a hundred thou can't break 'em
And the flow is hot like thou with Satan
And the only thing I got spinning is Daytons
The hotter I get, the more willing to snake 'em
So soon as the beat drop, watch where I take 'em
Compton swap meet to get me some All-Stars
When Game in the house, they callin' all cars
'Cause they heard about what went on in D.C
Heard about Hot 97, my beef with 50
Now tell me do he got a conscience?
I think not, 'cause if he did I wouldn't be involved in his nonsense
Wouldn't be in Harlem, wouldn't be at this conference
I'd rather be pushing rock like Samantha Ronson
50 whispered in my ear, like we still bonding
We ain't friends, I'm just acting like Charles Bronson
Middle finger in the air, one hand on my Johnson
Hip-Hop police on me like I'm the convict
What happened to the old school? I thought it was rhyming
Doug E. Fresh and Dana Dane on the corner like Common
Now that ain't common, it's more like Top Ramen
The flow is noodles, I throw it up like vomit
And I still shine like diamonds, they kicked me out of
G-Unit and I rebounded like Rodman
It's still Aftermath, two feet in the paint
Should I be mad? I ain't
I'm supposed to stop, I can't
Because I'm in the hood politicking, Impala liftin'
And I keep a black four-five on the side of my Prada denim
Chip on my shoulder like I'm fresh outta prison
Dollar vision, blow a hundred thou like my wallet missing
Then re-up like Kim before the d-cup
Continuously getting money with my feet up
Chasing the throne, here my black Air Force
I said fuck Benzino and got the cover of The Source
Feel me? If not then I guess you gotta kill me
But you ain't gon' do that, so, motherfucker, move back
While I do B.I.G. and Pac impersonations on two tracks
When I wake the dead, everybody remove hats
We miss y'all, can I get a hand clap?
Now back to rap and why I gotta stay strapped?
On that murder T-I-P, kill you ASAP
They don't know which hole to patch up when the K clap
I tried to spare you Young Buck, now it's time for payback
It go, how you from Cashville but you ain't got no cash, nigga?
Say my name, now that's your fucking ass, nigga
Kept your mouth shut and I gave you a pass, nigga
Now I gotta lay you down like the last nigga
Buck, buck, buck from my AK-47
This nigga playing with his life, I might have to put him in Heaven
Tryna play the game, talking shit up on the stereo
Prepare for burials when I'm reincarnating Harry-O
And you don't want that David 'cause you love your life
Get my Vibe? When it's war, he pull out butter knifes
Muthafucker, I'ma show you who the gangsta
All you do is Murder Inc., now who the wanksta?
When Suge had you, you were stranded on the row
Juve left you for dead and went back to the N.O
50 heard you on the tour bus and felt your little flow
Then he made you temporary replacement for Yayo
You a bitch and that's hard to swallow
And you got robbed for your spinning G-Unit chain in Chicago
I call my nigga Jojo to get it back
He had the shit in his hands and you ain't had the ten stacks
Picture that, I thought we was G-Unit
Then you ran and told 50 that I did the shit
Ask C-Murder, the boy ain't hard to find
I told Monica when I catch him, the boy is mine
Take one shot of Brandy and pop
Watch his panties drop when I run inside the Candy Shop
Fuck you, 50, Banks, Yayo, and the cops
And Olivia, I mean for a man, she hot
Now I'm running out of breath, like I just beatboxed
Got twenty bars to go, lay it down like sheet rock
Don't worry about the flow, the boy know he hot
Hurricanes in store November, nigga, fuck Reeboks
I'm fly like a hummingbird on a tree top
The new Hov, the new B.I.G., the new Pac, I need three spots
280 in, ain't no getting me back
I'm yelling, ""Fuck the world,"" on my victory lap
Remember first it was Buddens, then it was Bleek
Now it's whoever, motherfucker, yeah, who want beef?
Now whenever, motherfucker, who wanna see me?
In the coffin, body exhausted, resting in peace
You don't want war, nigga, you want peace
So give 'em the piece, capisce, let 'em rest in peace
From West to East, the flow is outdatable, irreplaceable
Lyrical homicide, hell is hot, I'm boxing with Satan
And I slipped 'em the ace, so you cannot replace 'em
If Eazy ever decide to return, I remain Jayceon
A king in the making and the throne is for the taking
So I climb the mountain top and put my stake in
Got the weight of the world on my shoulder

Graduated from the pills and them rocks, nigga
Money, power, respect, come through like the Lox, nigga
Fuck a bottle, buy the box, nigga
Bought a Audemar, we don't google, we buy the stock, nigga
Same old boppers, leader of the new school
Spraying on them lockers, no rain gon' stop us
Put the swang on yoppers, flush on the bottom
Gold fangs on the top ones, Lucc game with the chopper
And I'm known for cutting these hoes like I'm the bachelor
They stuck in the hood, I'm the spatula
Told these bitches, expose these bitches for who they are
You a thot, yeah I really know these bitches
Dick is all I owe these bitches for being themselves

The piggidy-piggidy face of a riggidy clown
Black out, back out like a flimsy blouse
Fuck a track out, like racing outside, pussies chalked outline
Niggas can't be outshined, out rhymed or out dimes
I'm like Magic in his prime without HIV
(Come on) It's stunting season
It's fuck niggas like gays but for the other reason
Me and Lucky getting cuddy in them other reasons
Period, the bitch bleed then I fucking bleed 'em
(What?) You fucking with a thot, nigga!
My Compton niggas come with K's like dot, nigga
Real when I talk, you can tell by my tone
A few instagram likes, the bitch swear that she on!
Live hoes from condos riding in Lambos, stunting pronto

She kinda thick, what's your measure?
Say her name bone collector, that's on the set-ta
354, I'mma a rep ride it real
She like the way I dress with them 501s on the chill
On our first two visits, nasty when I fuck her
Told her keep me out the clinic, on mamas I'm 'bout that business
Blowing money fast but I'm standing out them fences
Super pervert, I'm G. Levert to these bitches
Feeling like that nigga, back when I was skinny
Before I was filling out them pictures and fucking with your sister
Mr grab diamond ware share of hoes
And if my bitch didn't have a kid, I'd have a layer for hoes
Hella sick with this pimping, my mama taught me how to tell a chick from a chicken
Don't be fucking with a Christian
Diamond Lane banging, ain't hear it then get the trippin'
I'm a king of these thots, nigga, listen

Aight, the fuck are you lookin at, self?
You wanna piece of me?
Ohh man, shit
The story of my life

[Verse 1: The Game]
If I could start from scratch, I wouldn't change shit
Same red bandana, same four-fifth
Same G-wagon, same hoodrat bitch
Workers in the kitchen cookin' up my shit
Same telephone booth, same connect
That mean the same hollow tips breakin' up in my chest
Same bloody t-shirt, same address
Same Dogg Food album banging in my tape deck
Homie, if I can make '94 today
I'd tell Eazy and Dre to bring back N.W.A
I would've told 'Pac not to stomp out Orlando
Told Puffy and Big about the Rampart scandal
I got too many dead homies, fuck a rap career
I'd give anything in the world to bring back my nigga Tear
Seem like we was just in Magic City yesterday
If I could bring back my homeboy Charles, he would say

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back
[Verse 2: The Game]
Homey if I could rewind the hands of time
I would've cut off the PS2 at 12:49
Nigga I'm a gangster, I stay on my grind
Who knew 11 minutes later I'd get shot with my own 9
I was two beeps away from a flatline
When you a Bad Boy niggas don't wanna see you Shyne
Dre said it's my turn, he call it Game time
23 inch Lexani's, bitches call 'em LeBrons
I'd give my own life if I could change God's mind
Bring Baby Loony back at the drop of a dime
He let off a whole 'K, got shot one time
That was a cool nigga, I wish he had nine lives
My brother Jevon died cause he chased the cat
It's a dog eat dog world, Jesus please holler back
I got a confession to make, it's called payback
If you don't wanna listen, show me where Pastor Ma$e at

[Hook: Marsha Ambrosius]
If I could start my life from scratch
If I could take away the pain of the past
If I had another chance, I would do just that
I'd give anything just to go right back

[Verse 3: The Game]
I would've told Big Will they raid every Tuesday and Thursday
When pigeons in your coupe, you gotta watch where your birds lay
Would've told V to stay sober
When niggas beg for mercy, that mean the beef is over
Told Meeks take the Porsche back, drive the Rover
Told Slim hit reverse on that hardtop Nova
I would've changed a couple of lines when I wrote ""Soldier""
So I wouldn't have to live lookin' over my shoulder
My life is like a Impala, ridin' three-wheel motion
I been front to back, side to side
Level my six-four frame out, keep on rollin'
Keep your family far away and your enemies closer
Picture this, The Source sucking Benzino's dick
Tryin' to be the big fish in the pond, you know how them piranhas get
You dead when that green line go flat
If you could start your life from scratch, you couldn't change that

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Our Lord, grant us good in this world
And good in the life, to come keep us safe from the torment of the fire
As we keep our hands up high and scream for justice
Ferguson, rest in peace Mike Brown
And all the young soldiers out there
God help us

[Chorus: TGT]
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me
[Verse 1: Game]
Seen the pictures, feel the pain, scandalous how they murder son
Tired of them killing us, I'm on my way to Ferguson
Talked to TIP, I talked to Diddy, them my brothers walking with me
Mothers crying ""Stop the riots"", we ain't got to chalk the city
I seen Cole out there, felt I should go out there
They left that boy for hours in the cold out there
They killin' teens, they killin' dreams (It's murder)
[Verse 2: Diddy]
Yo, come on we gotta stick together, we all we got
Police taking shots and I ain't talkin' 'bout Ciroc
I'm talking 'bout Emmett Till, I'm talking 'bout Ezell Ford
I'm talking 'bout Sean Bell, they never go to jail for
Trayvon over Skittles, Mike Brown Cigarillos
History keeps repeating itself, like a Biggie instrumental
America's a glass house and my revenge is mental
Rather use my brain than throw a cocktail through a window
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I got the keys to the city still we left in the cold
Hands in the sky, still was left in the road
Ribbon in the sky, Michael Brown, another soul
Stole by the system, black men we pay the toll
The price is your life, Uncle Sam want a slice
Black dress code now we looting in the night
Now we throwing Molotovs in this holocaust
And I know they hate to hear me screaming, ""I'm a Boss!""

[Chorus: TGT]
Time to take a stand and save our future (Maybach Music)
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me
[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Tired of the okie-dokie, lying you Pinocchio
Driving while black, tell me, where am I supposed to go?
Gun shots hit the car, now I got the holy ghost
If excessive force was a drug, then they overdosed
Got us tryna protest, it's a slow process
Heard it's a lotta rotten eggs in the crow's nest
People praying on they feet, police holding on they heat
Turned on the news and seen a tank rolling down the street

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
Yeah, I seen a lot of ice water tossed and I know it's for a cause
My only question is, what we doing for the loss
Of Mike Brown?
'Cause right now, I challenge you to use your talents to
Speak up, and don't you ever let 'em silence you
'Cause action speaks louder than words, that's what I heard
Shot down with his hands up, that's what occurred
Man that sound absurd
Matter fact to me that sound like murder
We want justice

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Ayy yo Game, I had a crib out there
I used to live out there
So I know how niggas feel out there
People stressing, protesting, unity is a blessing
So it's time we come together
Use our voice as a weapon
I am Michael Brown, 'cause I stand for what he stand for
News say we're looting
Paint pictures like we some animals
On my NWA CMG
Hollerin' ""Rest in peace Eazy and fuck the police""
[Verse 7: Wale]
Heard another brother slain up in St. Louis
Sure the mother feel the pain, but what you famous doing
I’m sure the general population trying to be more active
But when the light finally catches you, you're ice challenged
Okay, and I support the ALS just like the rest of them
But you have yet to pay your debt
So you just flexing then
'Cause everybody care for a minute, then stop
People only there for a minute, then stop
And what's the point of giving if you ain't giving your all
We never getting ahead, might as well give up your heart

[Bridge: TGT & Swizz Beatz]
Where does it end?
I got my hands up, what else am I supposed to do?
Rest in peace to Mike Brown
Where does it end?
And all the other fallen soldiers
Tell me, where's the love for everything we're going through?
That will not be on the news or televised, ah
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
Hope that God can save us
Mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy me
As we lead in peace

[Verse 8: Swizz Beatz]
Martin Luther King had a dream
But they ain't respecting Jesse up out here
And they don't really respect Obama out here
Lights out, go dark - it's like a nightmare
How the fuck you play the game, but they ain't playing fair
It's going down, Armageddon right here
Right now, not on TV but right here
Put your flags in the air if you don't really care (Wave it)
We need justice yeah, we need justice here

[Verse 9: Curren$y]
I heard he surrendered but we all saw how they did him
Television broadcasts, a confused country
I'm a resident of a nation that don't want me
What's done is done the town erupts in fury
And I'm already hearing 'bout this lopsided jury
Three faces like his, the rest another story
A lot of motherfuckers need to act more worried
[Verse 10: Problem]
The revolution has been televised
If I sit here and do don't do nothing, homie, that's genocide
Fuck that, we have arrived
And who cares who ain't on our side 'cause we on our own
How do you preach peace to a family that just lost they own?
My brodie Game just banged my line like ""We gotta do something""
All that marching and that peace ain't gonna fucking do nothing
Fuck it, my moms, sorry I'm ready to rage
The police done let the animals out of the cage
Oh lord it's

[Chorus: Game's Daughter]
Time to take a stand and save our future
Like we all got shot, we all got shot
Throwing up our hands don't let them shoot us
'Cause we all we got, we all we got
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
God ain't put us on the Earth to get murdered, it's murder
Don't point your weapons at me

It's okay! I get it popping
Whole club rocking, like a six-four Impala
Drink Cris', throw it up, call the shit hydraulics
Then piss in the cup, call the shit Hpnotiq (Brrrrat!)
I bleed Compton, spit crack and shit chronic
And you new niggas ain't shit but new niggas
Bathing Ape-shoe niggas, I'm talking to you, niggas
Bouncing in the six-four, throwing up Westside, man
Sell another five million albums? Yes, I am

A hundred thousand on his neck, L.A. above the brim""

But the rest of you niggas better be glad you breathing
All I need is one reason

Keep on snapping your fingers, I ain't going away

And niggas talking about me, they don't know when to stop

No beam, no silencer; I know when to pop
Wait 'til Lil Jon come on and let off a shot

Me and Marshall ain't start shit, they listen to our shit
Then talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But it's hard when they hate us, and think Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them, Shady one of the greatest
Like Biggie and 'Pac was, we saw the throne was empty
And decided to chase it, me, him and 50 racin'
This rap shit is basic, I followed that Jay shit
Think of what I wanna say, step in the booth and one-take it
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical L.A. N.W.A. shit
The media is bullshit, now we can't even say bitch
They accusin' Michael of touchin' kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him, had a couple of facelifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin', I can taste this, swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and waste 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired of this black shit, this white shit

You're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face, which
Way do you wanna face when your brain's hit pavement?
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving
In my face, looking for answers, rap sensation
Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted, the mask of Jason
Was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting

[Intro]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Game]
Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging, who you beefing with?

[Verse 1: Skeme & The Game]
I know your baby never hurt nobody
But he got his ass smoked at that Mustard party
OG Blood, everybody know me
When I came in with the little homies (Skeme)
Get out the way yo, get out the way yo
That nigga Duke just moved an ounce of yayo
And you know I keep gunners on the payroll
I even fucked with Mitchy Slick down in Daygo
Young general these niggas down to spray for
You fuck around and catch twenty out this Range Rove'
Mayne, that beef shit is what a nigga made for
I open fire on her open mouth, case closed
Came in this bitch with Chuck Taylor screamin' ""Fuck haters""
Bad bitch I'ma fuck later, tryna touch paper
In a six-trey rag goin' brazy up the Ave. 
What I'm drinking got me thinking, nigga maybe
[Chorus: The Game, The Game & Skeme]
Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging, who you beefing with?
[Verse 3: Jay 305]
It's anybody killa, that's for anybody, nigga
Mainline, [?], westside nigga
Fuck peace, this for Crenshaw kings
Sockin' out niggas tall as Yao Ming
Lowkey is on drop, give a fuck bout whatcho mama
When it's on, it's on, pop it like a bottle of patron
Then lay back with a bitch, man this is westside Jay 3-0 fifth
No gimmicks, God damn

[Verse 4: Mitchy Slick]
I won't stop being a blood to gangland
To my dope then kicked in locked up in a strange land
So when they be like, ""Slick, why we ain't see you on TV or nothin'?""
Shit, I'm still tryin' get off the gang injunction
Cause when it come to this been, I'm a monster to your leaf
You can do a whole damu documentary on just me
Call it ""The Life of a Hundred Percent Real Whooper""
They did it for the grams, moves and the hush
Yeah Dat
[Chorus: The Game]
Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging, who you beefing with?
[Verse 5: Joe Moses]
I put the woop in the woop like my DLBs
All I know is VNGs and FTBs
I ran fades back to back, that's on STB
And if you claimin' you a blood, shit, you better know me
Big homie gave me a gun and said ""It better be empty""
I was eleven years old with a motherfuckin' .50
I got love for certain niggas, I've been doing this since knee high
And you ain't a real blood if you didn't bang at the beehive

[Verse 6: RJ]
Westside A-Hat, back in a straight jacket
Mister LA back, free my A track
Middle of July, I'm just tryin' bring a Maybach
Whole city riding, I ain't even did a Dre track
Nigga this Athens, Miller gang mad
So east coast niggas be like ""Cuh, you crackin'.""
Niggas ain't goin' hard, as you should stop rappin'
I'ma be the street rider 'til the casket
[Chorus: The Game]
Maybe I should iron out my flag
Maybe I should put another crease in it
Maybe I should iron out my flag
If you gang banging, who you beefing with?

[Part II: Da Homies]

[Verse: AD]
Im a real Compton Crip I hope you niggas get the message
Leave them 16's open, i'll make them look bad on records

After that, straight to the hood where them tanas holding them heaters
Look, sagging down the A-Line, war fuck it no play time
Hit my first tour I was still chuckin' up gang signs
Homies still cooking them cops hop out with K9
Lot of rappers's callin' out names, nigga don't say mine
The homies in the Cutlass on E

I'm really in the streets you other niggas is weak
On my mama and the hood, fuck around and Ya rest in peace
Especially when the homies in the Cutlass on E

[Chorus: RJ & Ty Dolla $ign]
The homies in the Cutlass on E
Niggas turnt up and we bout to hit the street
The homie on probation, make him sit up in the back

Finger on the trigger, bandana round the Mac

Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga
Gangstas, this is how we roll
Jesus piece and it's solid gold
Versace polo and a pound of dro
Hop in that Ghost then it's adiós
Who the fuck scared now?
Who the fuck scared now?

[Verse 1: The Game]
Chased that nigga down, put him on WorldStar
Bitch nigga got away in his girl car
Put that pussy on the net like a porn star
Another weenie with bread, he a corn dog
Put three holes in his head like a bowlin' ball
I'm out the gutta switchin' lanes in a stolen car
Fuck the feds 'cause a nigga got a murder charge
Fuck it though, got the cover of the Murder Dog
I dress up like the pizza man, load the Desert Eagle and
I don't just hit ya team, I wet the whole bleachers, damn
Specialize in the murder game
Documentary shit, back to Hurricane
Now tell a nigga
[Chorus: The Game]
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga
Gangstas, this is how we roll
Jesus piece and it's solid gold

Hop in that Ghost then it's adiós
Who the fuck scared now?

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm the most feared rap nigga
Like a Just Blaze beat, I clap niggas
This ain't a Just Blaze beat, this ain't wrapped, nigga
Voletta Wallace lost her son to a gat, nigga
What if I told y'all I know who killed Biggie, dawg?
I ain't no snitch but if I did, it ain't no biggie, dawg
'Cause that's Biggie, dawg
All this comin' out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as bein' 50's dawg
But I got tired of being 50's dog
Had to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off
Whole team celebratin', label on my dick hard
Interscope asking, would I take 50's call?
""Hello? Put up ten mill for a real nigga
Drop this joint album and we'll kill niggas""
G-Unit!
[Chorus: The Game & Meek Mill]
Who the fuck scared now? (Scared now)
Look who the fuck dead now (Dead now)
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga (Shotty, nigga)
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga (Yo)
Gangstas, this is how we roll (How we roll)
Jesus piece and it's solid gold (Solid gold)
Versace polo and a pound of dro (Pound of dro)
Hop in that Ghost then it's adiós (Adiós)
Who the fuck scared now? (Huh?)
(Who the fuck scared now?)
Who the fuck scared now?
(Yeah, Meek Milly)

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All these niggas claimin' they O.G.s, my young boys'll murder them
Cold shooters that's sixteen and they ain't even never heard of them
I slide through, I get a bird to them
And they drive through and they servin' them
These niggas talkin' that beef shit, I put bread on it, no burger bun
We walk up in this bitch like, ""What?""
Rollie on my wrist light up
Told these niggas, ""Can't do it like us""
Cîroc boy and I do it like Puff
With a hundred bottles, a hundred models
No Twitter, we ain't come to follow
Straight shots and no Moscato
I fuck them hoes, don't give a fuck 'bout 'em
Now tell me who's scared now? (Now)
Shots fired, man down (Down)
Dead bodies get found (Found)
That chopper clip spits rounds (Blaghh)
And real niggas get murdered (Murdered)
Top dogs get it first (First)
He came to me in that Benz (Benz)
And he left from here in a hearse
Woah!
[Chorus: The Game]
Who the fuck scared now?
Look who the fuck dead now
Had to hit him with the shotty, nigga
Another dead fuckin' body, nigga
Gangstas, this is how we roll

You know how on point my aim is
Long range sniper's, clash of the titan's, chrome pipen'
In this 300 like Leonidas
Snub in the bubblegoose, riding down the interstate
Where fiends put them needles in they arm and let 'em penetrate
Leanin' sideways with my fitted straight
The 27's on point, the paint job a New York minute late
Check my Audemar, no cloud's in my stones
Project's ringin', standin' by the corner store
Two Glocks on me, BANG BANG if you wanna war
That was '05, now we ballin' on this tour
Screamin' out ""Thug Life"", pourin' Belve on ya whore
Money I'm involved with it, wake up and ball with it
Kobe/Gasol with it, uncut raw with it
Chop bricks take trips ot
Before I had a goatee, I used to bag the Oz
(Yeah, fish-scale nigga, What up Ghost!?)
Then stash 'em by the oak tree, move it by the coke leaf
Drama let the llama Knick niggas like Charles Oakley
Nigga don't insult me, I banana boat B.R.C.K.S.'s
And stuff 'em in the Lexus
I'm sitting fat like Precious, Christ up on the necklace
And I keep them clips on a dresser
Yes sir, I'm bout to ball, Louis bag the fuckin' mall
Bitches, money and fast cars, nigga I want it all
(Yeah, word to my kids nigga, I want it all)
Nascar Game, why the fuck would I stall!?
I'm the franchise nigga, Chris fucking Paul!
Empty out the cannon hit ya bitch, you the truck and all
Withdrawal 200 thousand, and then FUCK it off!
King of the hill, gotta dime bitch cuttin' raw
She bagged the last nick', I unzip, she suck it soft
Black Superman, yeah, I'm above the law
I put this hollowtip a quarter inch above ya jaw
Eat out a FUCKIN' straw!
Blindfold your bitch toss her in the trunk
After the first 48 that bitch smellin' like a skunk
It's a wrap, I rap, when I wrap the punk
Throw me in the gang module and tell 'em wrap the bunks
The breakfast club nigga, no Captain Crunch
This for my dog nigga's that eat cat's for lunch
I'm hungry like I ain't trapped in month's
So nigga act and stunt, my Glock pack a punch
Or I can Heckler-Koch, and seal your pine box
Leave your head wrapped for months, while I pass the blunt
To my niggas, we all Roc'd out, what's up Jigga?
Sometimes I be in BK, with Fab' on the freeway
Lincoln Continental and I copped it off a eBay
I pop cham. like it's my b-day, horse power
Under my hood like it's an olympic relay
My flow right on time, no delay
I raise a million dollars, send it off to Chile
(Word to my red cross, I don't fuck with the Red Cross)
I'm All-Madden nigga, EA, I'm in VA
Money talks with Dre and Pharrell on 3-Way
Them 28's, that's my DJ, they spinning shit
When I took trips OT, I never rented shit
I just drop then cop, and then I tinted shit
Diddy and Mike Epps, I'm All About The Benjamins
In it for the benefits, I'll be down in Ten to 6
Tell 'em get me a Porterhouse and some eggs-Benedict
Damn that was good, but I'm still hungry
And I'm living it, I be out in Venice, shit
They say Weezy-Jordan, nigga I'm on my Pippen shit
They say Drake-Lebron, I'm on my Moe Williams shit
If T.I.P. is Kobe then fuck it, I'm Derek Fisher, shit!
Long as I'm in the starting five, I'm a get it in
Cause I promised the city of Compton, I would get it in!
I was OutKast'd... Andre Benjamin
Now I slide through with my Dominican woman friend
(She like puttin' No Ceilings in, yeah)
Giuseppe Heels, expensive wines, Perri seal
It ain't tricking, I just spend money on cheap thrills
Big Phantom's, sweet wheels
Back seat like a club, make them bitches eat pills
Take Patrone shots to the purse with chrome Glocks
Jay Electronica, this a dome shot
So I had to steal it, nigga I had the kill it!
I was the turtle in the race, I made the rabbit feel it!
(Yeah, keep runnin' nigga)
Housing by the subway, feel it through the projects
Come through the Murcialago, a foreign object
Number one prospect, the day that I was drafted
Aftermath-matic unleashed a fuckin' bastard!
Don't respect none of you niggas, get in the casket!
Talking ratchets, never touched a fuckin' automatic
Drama this is tragic, put it in the plastic
88 bars and runnin', throw it with my other classics
(Drama you should've warned these niggas, I'm bout to kill 'em)
Yeah, trash bag it, this is crack
And I know you been fiendin' for this, come get your packs
I do it for the music nigga, fuck the Plaques
Ain't on no beef shit, but it's still FUCK the rats!
And when I'm in New York, I set a bunch of traps
Put the cheese where they can see it, and if you stunt, you clapped
Catch 'em in the club, that's when I stomp 'em flat
Nigga get up after that, go get a fucking bat
(I tell you bout these fucking rats!)
They either snitch or bend over to catch
No matter how you look at it, I hate fucking rats!
Get my bottle of Ciroc and I twist the cap
Sit back watch the NBA play-offs and roll a bat
Yeah, real fat, yeah, all I do is stack bread
In the hood on the wall like a fucking Phathead
Two nines on your back, Warren Sapp, yeah!
This my block and you niggas can't trap here
Unless you wanna get clapped here, head wrapped, yeah
I'm killing niggas, I should have a hundred tat tears
Celebrate your death, toast bottles and clap beers
It's gon' be a cold summer, come through like burr!
The red Phantom bullshittin, the 25, Steve Kerr
The beat insane, Just Blaze in this mothafucka
The cars outside, the 'K is in this mothafucka
I should let off a couple strays in this mothafucka
Fuck that, I'm tryna get laid in this mothafucka
(Yo, tell your friends to get with my friends... Yeah)
Meet me in the parking lot, license plate Aftermath
Screamin' out ""Fuck 50"", wouldn't snitch for half his cash
If he wasn't such a bitch, nobody would've had to blast
They stood us down in Jacksonville, don't make me have to wrap ya Jag'
Cause I rather be in Saint Tropez, unpackin bags
With bitches that speak French, how you say: ""catch a cab""
I don't trip Euros, I don't trip Pounds
I bowlin' ball bitches, till I knock 'em all down
(Like the '93 Pac, I Get Around)
Duffles by the staircase, crack by the backdoor
Navigate my way through the South, I used to trap ho
All the way through Queensbidge moving packs yo
Might've lost a couple friends, but I got my gat though
Blast fo', my Rap foes could never stop my cash flow
Had a Nike box of hundreds, when I was in that RAV4
But now I pull up in that truck with the crash board
With the mag low, give you everythin you ask for
Sometimes, I can be a fucking asshole
In the bank with my mask on, look at this nigga A-R
Don't take your fucking mask off, bitch empty out the cash drawer
We on a suicide mission, but we don't give fuck
Cause if we make it out, bigger house bigger truck
I'm in a strip club with a Glock, nigga what!?
Gimme your bitch, she got a cuter face and bigger butt
I ain't gon' do shit but pour champagne on her
Hit it from the back and watch half of the Laker game on her
(Don't put that back on, too many cum stains on it)
Run a train on her, call Cartoon
Have 'em tattoo my name on her, Star Trak too
You know what? Fuck it, Aftermath too
Put a little smoke around it then take it home and pound it
Helicopter outside, nigga I'm surrounded
Had a spot in the Jungles till the fuckin Fed's found it
Momma, your son got a public announcement
I got 5 million in the walls and the couches
(Don't even think about it... We got cameras, dogs and guns)
Ask Pe-Pe, he was there, he can vouch it
Throw it in the trashcan on some Oscar The Grouch shit
A bunch of green popped out, time to re-route shit
Settle down in Mississippi, gotta down South click
And my niggas like, ""we ain't know all about this""
And any nigga ever snitch, got his fuckin' mouth fixed
You get 25, he get his fuckin' throat slit
Cut 'em like Filet Mignon and throw em off a boat, bitch!
Feed 'em to the sharks then dock the yacht
Oil in the water, damn the ocean so thick
Time to finish off his niggas on some trench coat shit
It's a drug war, real life, Grand Theft
Catch you in the streets fuck you up and hit ya man next
Come through on some retarded shit, just sprayin' techs
Where my dogs at? tell 'em I'm crazier then DMX
Lazier then Chinese eyes, when I'm puffin that
Blueberry, I ain't talking where the muffins' at
(Roll up the sour diesel if you want nigga)
I split open the dutch, then I'm stuffin' that
You should get a flight to California, come fuck with that
That's all you, go ahead, hop in the truck with that
Take it down in Cashville and hit Young Buck with that
Don't bring nothin' back, Border Patrol cuffin that
I ain't trying see the pen, and have to get my knuckles wrapped
I wake up real early, keep lunchin fags
This shit easy, you Rap niggas my punchin bags
(I got some combinations nigga, Pacquiao shit)
Talkin 'bout you poppin tags, talkin 'bout u poppin Cris'
Where u get it poppin at? Nigga u ain't poppin shit
But a X pill, as I turn the Lex' wheels
I got a mean Phantom, very upset grill
Tell'em why you mad son, that nigga pulled a fast one
You know who you are, when I see you that's ya ass son
But I'm in the club, throwin' shots like my last gun
It's 2o'clock, YURR, gotta make a cash run
(Yo, go get the truck from around the corner, tell Wack I'll meet 'em outside)
Into the 7-11 bout to blast one
This nigga A-R will not keep his fuckin' mask on
Deal with it when we get to the crib
You niggas is wildin'! Wait till we get to the crib
And split this fuckin' money up
Hit the block and dummy up
Shave the onion, slice it down the middle, that's a tummy tuck
That's how we do it in Compton, FUCK the Police!
Defend my hood like an NHL goalie
(Sometimes it's cold on these mothafuckin' streets nigga)
Iced out Rollie
And I still remember everythin' that Dre told me
Red Polo fleece, sippin on that O.E
Never been to jail cause I never had a cold D
Do it just like the O.G.'s
Cut the Impala in half, insert the gold D's
Then bounce this mothafucka till it got a slow leak
Flatbed pick it up and you know me
I'm goin with the car, all night, no sleep
(Gotta get this mothafucker back on the
Strip)
Next day we in the red Phantom, 4 deep
Kids runnin up to the car, block off the whole street
It's the ice cream man like the Ol' P
Cali like the Lion's o-line, it's where the holes(hoes) be
BC runnin shit like a nose bleed
Don't get it confused or screwed like Codine
More swag then the niggas from the show-me
That's ya bitch I'm bout to Mac her like Goldie
(Shit, together we can rule the world baby)
Blacked out Cartier, Four Season's caviar
Spray a lil Diddy on it, that'll get their panties off
Nigga see me in the lobby lookin like ""damn he soft""
Catch me outside where I can let this cannon off
Soo to the Woo, bet I let this cannon off
And put everything in the clip right where u standin, dog
Ride off in a Mazi' like can I ball?
For the bucks, I'm tryna get it like Brandon dog
(Young Money clearly NBA rookie of the year)
I'm still standin tall wish the Twin Towers was
Take innocent lives, that's the type of shit a coward does
I'm just reminiscin', smokin' on the sour, blood
Take a couple more hits and pass the shit around the bus
U can't tell me shit I done seen a thousand drugs
Hundred rounds in ten drums, that's a thousand slugs
One day I flipped the kitchen table, found a bug
Kept lookin', found another one, right around the subs
(Ayyo, Fed's can u hear me? God damn)
I was takin a shit, then I seen one by the tub
Feedin' my fish, there's a wire right by the rug
Dumb mothafuckers this is not where they buy the drugs
That's Salami in the kitchen that we fryin up
The world full of bitches, all the niggas dyin' up
They strechin' niggas out for crack, all the fiends tryin dust
We got some mean smokers for the sack they tie u up
Quarter sack and get the pound, brick burn the house down
(The connect ain't gon' think that shit is funny)
The fuck these niggas laughin at? Run up, u got some cash in that?
Knock on ya momma's door, ya head sittin' in a bassinette
While I'm on a G4, smokin' up half the jet
All season in New York, smokin' up half the Jets
246 bars ain't broke half a sweat
Just got half a mil', gave the hood half the check
And I done shot it out with probly over half the 'jects
Sometimes just for the love, the other half, respect
(That's that HOOD shit, I'm livin' GOOD bitch!)
Out of my mind like breakin' off half an X
Movin through Hollywood faster than a bag a Meth
Yup, nigga's better watch they step
'Less they in a fraternity, but that ain't concernin' me
Let's get back on this ape shit, back to the basics
Cold words, flip birds in the kitchen with cake mix
Yeah, Betty Crocker that, then hit the block with that
Cut off khakis, house shoes and a stockin' cap
(Hit the Swapmeet... Get me some white T's, red-tip socks)
My flow a 38. don't make me have to cock it back
Shoot it like Olajuwon and bring the old Rocket's back
Two holes in ya face where ya sockets at
Bring the whole hood out and show 'em how to drop a rat
They got them brand new Porsche's out, I'm coppin that
V12 under the hood, ain't no stock in that
Panoramic sunroof, me and this chick watchin glass
My hood is like cameras in the bumper, watch ya ass
(Get ya ass smoked around these parts, youngin')
What the fuck u thought? Ride up bangin Too Short
Smoke u like a Newport, nigga this ain't New York
I be in the jungle with lions or in the zoo lost
Or with my wolves that's dyin' to get they tools off
City Of Angels, be careful who you cross
Niggas'll run in Mr.Chow's and take them fuckin' jewels off
Rappin' all that goon shit, we all know that u soft
A baby's ass in the Martha Stewart face cloth
(Or a box of cotton, stay pushed 'til your rotten)
So, nigga you stay on your Rap shit, while I stay on my trap shit
My, bust a gat shit, Busta hit me like: ""u wrote 400 that quick? ""
Naw, 282 and that's just cause the track sick
120 more, welcome to the liquor store
Same one that frog sent me, lil' nigga get the raw
And I did it, Cedar Block, I'm with it
Who you think got all these niggas in them Cincinnati fitted's?
(Yeah, took America and Ken Griffey'd that)
7-5-8's, throw on my crown, throw on my khakis
Then brush the Nike's down
Jump in the 'Lac and push to Nike town
Where Them Space Jam's? I need 'em right NOW!
Jordan sweatsuit on, OH Let's Do It!
Go Wocka Flocka on them nigga's in these new kicks
You know how that go, new kick's, new whip
Blue 6, loc'in on the set like a new Crip
(That line was so crazy I had to say that shit, Blood)
Interior coke white, smooth like Cool Whip
Sold the shit to Rick Ross, 80 thou', a cool flip
Then I got that vibrant thing, my lil' Q-tip
That Maserati a problem, especially with the dual shift
0 to 60, and WHOO! It's like a mule kick
I swear to God like the preacher in the pool pit
Speakin of pools, mine heated, come through bitch
Long as it's La Perla, I don't care who you come through with
(Canadian, Spanish, French, nigga whatever!)
Minage in the deep end, head on the back end
I wanna fuck the Asian bitch, next time leave your fat friend
Why the fuck y'all in the Honda all packed in?
Headed to Inglewood, say wassup to Mack 10
Say wassup to Glock 9, I'm back on you nigga's heads
L.A. would be a ghost-town if I wanted nigga's dead
Run with my Goon Squad cause more than half you nigga's Fed's
It's either that, you ATF or one of 50's friend's
(I see the wires hangin' out you nigga's Levi's)
Well fuck it though cause the nigga did let me in
But he ain't wanna see the Game in HD on ESPN
I think the boy's John-in', we was the best of friends
Then shit flipped, went to his holmes like I was Mexican
We all know the rest, put the burner to his chest
Hit him with ""300 Bars"" and let the streets do the rest
Yes! Terror is over you can eat now, Jayceon(Jason) killed Freddy
The WHOLE world can SLEEP now!
(Dream-snatcher, that's ME now)
Take your money lay yo' bitch ass on the beach now
I can see it, a G-Unit beach towel
Another man on it, ya'll 'bout to tan on it?
Send some lil' goons by to kick some fuckin' sand on it
We ain't watchin', go 'head nigga, jam on it
Damn homie in high school you was the man homie
You was lucky in Manhattan, the clip jammed
But come to Cali you a moose in some quicksand
(Sink nigga, like a fuckin' boat with bullet-holes in it)
Buttersoft Banks, you a bitch man
Me and you was cool 'til 50 unscrewed your kickstand
And Yayo, turn in your senior citizen wristband
Slap the shit out you for @LilHenchman
And just like the old days, I play the bench man
Dre play the big hand, I'm cool with the 6th man
Never selfish nigga, I'm eatin shellfish nigga
My legacy will never die, the black Elvis nigga
(Come check me out in Graceland nigga, pull the guitar out and e'rrything)
Glock by my pelvis, clip by the waistline
On the block like Chris Bosh, shoot it from the baseline
We at the 350 mark, it's break time
(Ayyo, go get the L out the car man...
Naw, this Purple Haze nigga, I'm 'bout to roll this shit up
Get high nigga, finish this mothafuckin' ""400 Barz""
Naw, my key's right there... By that, by that, Cocunut Ciroc... Yeah, Let's Go
Yo, and tell The Runners I'm hungry man
Get me some Frech Toast, Bacon and shit)
Run up on you with 50 bean's and 50 chef's
Niggas thinkin' it's a game, tryna push ""select""
Call a time out, like I'm OUT!
All these soft ass Rappers fakin' the crime route
Niggas got real quiet now that Shyne out
Don't make me smuggle 'em outta Belize and pull them 9's out
Niggas scared now, my Goon Squad here now
We turnin' on the headlights and runnin over deer's now
(Yeah... All up in the wood's, what's good!?)
And I'm the only one you Rap niggas should fear now
You see a G-Unit poster, you better tear it down
I'm talkin' to you mothafucker, so turn around
The beef forever lives, never ever put ya burner down
I beat the shit out these niggas, they Tina Turner now
Stripped of their manhood, ass naked like they Shermin' out
While I peel the top on the block and just burn it out
Hit the strip club with my niggas and just turn it OUT!
(Ayyo, that's Jeezy mothafuckin' Lambo'? Shit cold nigga)
They got free hot wings, they bringin full serving's out
It's all good, we straight, time to perm' it out
Katt Williams, run up in ya house, tie you up
And make you watch while we run through your spouse
Rip off her fuckin' blouse! Tiger Woods been in this?
No thank you, pass that bitch to Menace
Get what I came for, stuff it inside the Range doors
380 bars and get ready for the main course
(Yo, gimme a couple of them napkins, a salad fork... I'm starvin' nigga!)
June 15th, one of us gotta change course
But not the one that spit 400, blunt'd and ain't hoarse
8 plaques on the wall, hang yours
Before you get one, I'll probly have 8 more
It never been about the money with me
Just been about tryna get my nigga somethin' to eat
Take 'em on a couple of tours, get 'em somethin' to beat
Never satisfied, that's why we keep the gun's on his feet
(Yeah... All I know is block's, Glock's and Ciroc... Let's Get It!)
Who got a blunt I can chief? Nigga's runnin around like Indians
But near not one of'em chief
Killa California, I'm just one of the beasts
Take a fuckin' blood bath and bathe myself with the beef(UHH!)
It's the home stretch but I ain't even home yet
Only thing can stop me, is ME, I'm my own threat
Eatin' Lobster's, writin' Al Capone checks
I still ain't on the level of N.O.R.E. or Capone yet
(Nigga's gon' learn, respect the veteran's... Nigga, apologize to Cube)
But after this year, and after this here
Niggas won't see the throne for another 6 years
P.S. mothafucker, ain't no bitch here!
I'm goin' out the same way I came in, 5th gear
I see the finish line, SHIT YEAH!
(It's time to celebrate, Kanary bring that Cris' here
Sticks tell Crack bring the car around the back)
400 and 6 bars... BITCH, it's a WRAP!5Embed"

Can I trust you gonna ride for me like I ride for you?
Future Hendrix, yeah!
Bongo, by the way

[Verse 1: Future]
Money we burn it on bitches like candles
Can I trust you gonna ride for me like I ride for you?
I speak your name and it's royalty
You see the stress and my loyalty
You gotta be there for me through the casualties
You see my trials and my tribulations
You can tell them demons tryna capture me
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
I know these niggas gon' ride, yeah, squeeze triggers
You gotta put in some time for this
Almost lost my mind for this
Fuck all that crying lil bitch
Niggas round my way, they dying for this

[Chorus: Future]
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas

Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
[Verse 2: The Game]
You already know me, know how I get down
Know I'm with the shit when I pull up
Any nigga ever disrespected you from the beginning
I put the chrome to his neck like a pull up
You know a nigga bang Cedar block
You was bool with it, wasn't you?
Talkin' 'bout when a nigga gonna leave the block alone
But you never say this shit when I'm fucking you
We was the Huxtables, everything was perfect
Everything was working
We had some beautiful kids together
Had a nigga feeling like everything was worth it
Closet full of Birkins
How you make a nigga spend a million dollars on purses?
Then have an attitude
Like you in the studio helping a nigga write verses
Had a nigga focused on the future, now a nigga feeling like Future
We both dealing with a new nigga 'round our kids
And we ain't kill 'em yet, nigga, I salute you
And I still bang like I used to, red Impala, gold things like I used to
Pick up my kids, they don't see none of that
But when I'm back in the hood I'm yelling soo woo!
And it was all good just a week ago
Shit, we was Nicki and Meek a week ago
Gave you everything, the watch, the house, the cards
Tatted your passport, and now you wanna see me low
Wanna take my pussy, give it to the next nigga free
One thing about the next nigga
He just the next nigga, he can never be me
I'm coming to get my kids and they momma like
[Chorus: Future]
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Only thing that ever mattered to me was my niggas
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours

[Verse 3: The Game]
Compton ain't the same
Where all these bitch niggas come from?
Can’t even take a fade or ride through the hood
Without niggas hands out like they want some
But where you at when I need you?
See most of these niggas see through
You throw up a P, I throw up a P too
You pulling out heat, I draw the heat too
Compton made me like this, nigga
Fuck all these bitches, get money and die
Hundred niggas in my section, hundred Rollies in the sky
There's a hundred little niggas that will bang on a nigga
Put the flame on a nigga, take chains from a nigga
That will go BG, Turk and Wayne on a nigga
When the club get cloudy let it rain on a nigga
We are with the shit, let us redefine lit
That’s in the club smoking on extendos, extendo with the clip
Standing on the couch like wah
Backwood hanging out my mouth like wah
Who the fuck want a problem?
Once you’re shot, leave a nigga dead on an island
Creep out the back door with my side bitch, aye
[Chorus: Future]
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours
Fuck all these bitches, I'm yours

Say I'm with my niggas, I just
Oooh-oooh-oooh
Don't you know there's no better time than when I'm with you?
But I can't control these temptations when a nigga not with you
You wanna be done with me, but your heart won't let it
Standing at the front door but you just can't exit
You wanna be with me
You wanna be with me
You wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me
Me, me, me, me
You wanna be with me, with me, with me, with me

[Chorus: Pusha T & The Game]
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, your honor
Name Me King
Name Me King
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name Me King
Name Me King

[Verse 1: The Game]
Brick by brick I built my fortress
My queen beautiful, Lamborghini is gorgeous
Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
Growl made the towers fall, 911 Porsches
Number 9 Jordans pause the Air Forces
Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
Gold bars melted and what returned Rolexes
Niggas got Breitlings to burn
Loyalty to earn
Royalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback
Sipping 'tron out the Stanley cup, I don't give a fuck
Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
My son, my heir in Nike Airs, named my little nigga King
Meaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene
Even when I was in front of triple beams
Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king
[Chorus: Pusha T & The Game]
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, your honor
Name Me King
Name Me King
I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses
Name Me King
Name Me King

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Raise your glass for the last of the kingpins
The crown in the Maserati grill is mingling
Rollies cross oceans like Frank out in England
The Gay Pride bezel rainbow like it's spring again
Haah crack rock, crack rock nigga
My SC430 was a drop nigga
Go figure, this nigga play Go Fish
My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
My young baby sitter now my old bitch
Blowjobs cause what I sold made her nose itch
(EUGHK!) It's the king being crowned
Watch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)
It's sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
Been on his heels like a gum shoe (EUGHK!)
He took the throne so I could run through
[Chorus: Pusha T & The Game]
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, your honor
Name Me King

I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
Kidnap the queen, rode away on white horses

[Verse 3: The Game]
Rose petals at my feet when I'm stepping out the Rolls
The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
Sweatin' like a slave where them pies get sold
Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
Adjust the temperature let the heat rise up
Like Jesus Shuttlesworth in that glass jar
Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
Five more minutes says the silent gold hand going 'round on my Audemar
Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
Show me what that baking soda bring, do it for your king
Every time I look up, they cook up
I be the master of them P's I got the hook up
From New Orleans to Virginia
I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
Never been caught, can't be bought, she's a winner
Fly 'em south for the winter make it back home for dinner
[Chorus: Pusha T & The Game]
Open the pearly gates, bright white lights Madonna
Angels lined up in my honor, your honor

I bumped ""Ether,"" bumped ""Takeover""
Seein' Jay and Nas on stage was hip-hop's makeover
And that very day you knew niggas was born
Tyler, The Creators, Drake, J. Coles, and Big Seans
Time for the world to pay homage
Bow to the rap Gods or them K's vomit
Fuck you know about Dipset you little dipshit
If you ain't fuck, then you ain't get your dick wet
I see your little chain
I see your little dreads, tryin' to be a Lil Wayne, shit
I used to wanna be a little Hov
Started with a little rock, got me a little stove
Made a little money, bought me a little Rov'
Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
Sold ten mill, everybody know my name now
Thinkin' back, it's a motherfuckin' shame how
Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
Sometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
As the blood spills from my pen
It's time to confess my sins, cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I smoke weed, pop pills, but I'm thinkin' it's time for me to chill
Cause I ain't tryin' to go to hell
I'm tryin' to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight
But I ain't tryin' to go to hell
[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]
Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right

[Verse 2: Game]
Dre promised me records, I never got 'em
That's why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
For all my albums missed records
Felt he shitted on me for Kendrick, recorded diss records
And Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape
I pop champagne when I heard he was with Dre
And I'm tellin' y'all this true story cause I'm real
Dre, first time, hearing 'bout it, wonder how he feel
Cause I feel like shit severin' the relationship
The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
Snoop, Pac, Em, 50, me, K. Dot, watch us do a 360
Plus The Documentary saved me from penitentiaries
I ain't trippin', niggas been disloyal for centuries
Finally got the crown, this motherfucker meant for me
Funny how you do your top 5's and don't mention me
Fuck 'em all

[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]
Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect
No, no no no
Why is everything wrong?
Oh I can't get it right, I always try to get it right

[Break: K. Roosevelt]
See I been spendin' these late nights
On girls I never see again
Constantly intoxicated
Only God could save me, yeah
With 'em by the sunrise
One day everyone dies
That's the way the story goes
But now, I can't feel my heart
But I just keep ridin', ridin'
Feel so numb, numb, oh yeah

[Chorus: K. Roosevelt]
Father forgive me, cause I ain't perfect

Why is everything wrong?

But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la

Rreminiscin' about my day with your blood all over my slate
As the devil sings la-la-la

[Verse 1: Game]
Dre, I ain't mean to turn my back on you
But I'm a man, and sometimes a man, do what he gotta do
Remember, I'm from Compton too
I saw you and Eazy in 'em, so I started wearin' Khaki suits
I was 12 smokin' chronic, in '92
I had a choice, be like Mike, or be like you
I made a choice, now its be Crip or be Piru
Whatever I was, I was bangin' Gin & Juice
Never knew back then, I'd be friends with Snoop
Now I gotta keep it gangsta, 'cause its in my roots
So I owe you my life, when I betrayed you
I tried to think of what the fuck, Eminem might do
If every nigga hated him, for the Black Bitch track
And niggas stopped bumpin' Dre after Dee Barnes got slapped
When Doc say its a wrap, its a wrap
Its still Aftermath, and ain't nothing after that
[Chorus: Shorty of Da Lench Mob]
I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say
I guess my mind just drew a blank, like la-la-la

[Verse 2: Game]
I never said Thank You, and I took for granted
You let me in your house, and made me a part of your family
Now I'm eatin' with you, Eve, and Busta Rhymes
I wasn't starstruck, I was just glad to be signed
And even though sometimes I run loose
You still my homeboy Doc, I'd take a bullet for you
I'm not askin' you to take my side in the beef
But you told me it was okay to say Fuck The Police
Now its my turn to carry the torch
And I still got the chain that you wore on the cover of The Source
Remember when we got drunk, to do Start From Scratch?
I told you, you was like a father to me I meant that
Sittin' here lookin' at my platinum plaques
Thinkin' what the fuck am I without a Doctor Dre track
When Doc say its a wrap, its a wrap
Its still Aftermath, and ain't nothin' after that

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
See when the world is on your shoulder and the stress grows bigger
The fire in 'em, made it difficult to talk to the nigga
Most of the time I let 'em know, I don't agree with what he do
But he a hardhead Dre, that's why I'm talkin' to you
See, when I first met my nigga, son was layin' in the cut
Type reserved, homie was quite and kept his mouth shut
Until you told him to spit for me, he flippin' from the gut
I dug his spirit, and I thought the dude was talented as fuck
As time went on, now he was workin' with the finest
I saw the pressure started to build, so I gave additional guidance
You gave him something that can make or break a nigga, you should face it
So big, I don't even think he was ready to embrace it
With the potential to be a strong nigga with conviction
The only problem was our little nigga wouldn't listen
But when Doc say its a wrap, it's a wrap
Its still Aftermath and ain't nothing after that
[Chorus: Shorty of Da Lench Mob]
I didn't mean to walk away
But I hear every word they say

[Verse 1: The Game & sample]
My little nigga Frogg dead, dog
They shot my little nigga in his head, dog
You heard what the fuck I just said, dog?
Walk inside my closet like fuck everything red, dog
If you seen your best friend stiff, you would cry too
Sometimes I don't even wanna be a Piru
Then I think about it like, fuck everything blue
Who killed my motherfuckin' brother?
(""I wanna know!"")
Who killed G man too? The shit I seen men do
If I told you, I'd have me floating in some cement shoes
See Compton ain't shit really
And I’ve been at the bottom of the pits, feel me?
I done had some real niggas try to kill me
Fake niggas in my crew
Crip niggas more loyal than a few of my Piru
I done been shot, had a surgery or two
Above the rim like Pac, I’m like birdie at the troops
I can’t lie, every time I see Suge my heart beat
Cause I don’t know if I should dap him or let the hawk speak
Wilmington and Brazil, nigga them my cross streets
And who gon’ take it from me?
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names
Click-clack explain
I can kill you but ain’t nothing gon' change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day
But for you
Today is the day
Today is the day

[Verse 2: The Game & sample]
I was playing Madden then I heard a knock
Everybody know I got shot but this for niggas that forgot
Sometimes I thank God that I got set up
When you shot twice in the chest, it's kinda hard to keep your head up
Suspect one: the homies never came to see me
Suspect two: Red hid my gun behind the TV
Suspect three: I was beefing with this Crip in my apartment
Shit started cause we fought and he couldn't see me
There's usually ten niggas in our dope spot
Cold ass night, I'm like a janitor at Wing Stop
I usually play Xbox with the gun cocked
I'm cool with taking mine, but I took other niggas' gunshots
Chest wide open, I'm tryna fight, but my lungs not
Hole in my chest bout the size of a kumquat
I know who shot me 'cause I shot them
But who set me up? I ain't tripping but—
(""I wanna know!"")
[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
They think they know me
But they do not know me
Cause I do not know me
Who killed my homie?
I wanna know names

I can kill you but ain’t nothing gonna change
But I might do it anyway
You gonna die any way
I’m gonna die any way
We can go any day
It can be any day

Let me tell you how I met my nigga Wack
Shit, he ain't always have a nigga back
When I met him, he was standing behind Suge
And everything is all good when you banging for your hood
Compton
That nigga Wack got my number and came through
Now let me tell you the type of shit the Game do
He walked in the booth where I was spitting
Gave him ten thousand, couldn't even finish his fuckin' sentence
I ain't owe him shit, but real recognize real
Now we like two red-nosed Pits
Cross him, you gotta cross me
And don't forget about where my nigga AR be
He be in the cut, that niggas nuts, don't give a fuck
Love his nigga Game to death, and he mean it from the guts

(One blood, one blood, one blood, one blood, one blood)

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
Peace Blood, peace Almighty (Peace Blood!)
We all thugs and we run the streets nightly (Eastside!)
And get my lawyer; why? 'Cause I ain't coppin' out (Nope!)
And I fuck with B-boys that bring them choppers out
One shot of that'll have the boys bring the coppers out
And we ballin', foreign toys what we hoppin' out (Flossing!)
My fair Eastside, where we ride
And we all fly high in the Lear G5s (Ballin'!)
So twist your fingers up and bang, motherfucker, bang! (Nine-Trey!)
Get your money up, this 'caine is what we fuckin' slang (Gotta hustle!)
And Nine-Trey is what I fuckin' claim (Ugh!)
It's Dipset Capo, the don of the Byrdgang (Eastside!)

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
They call me D-O-dub, wasn't really trippin', cuz
Twenty-one, twenty Crips and all of us is Crippin', cuz
We from a different street, all got that different heat
But when we move the Macs
When Game come, we on the same beat
So if you fuck with Blood, then you fuck with us
And we ain't bustin' duds, 'cause we bustin' slugs
Be sure to stay in touch and clean your mess up
And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-W-W-W-West up!
[Verse 3: Nas]
Game got at me about the remix, it's a honor, my nigga
I made rap one blood, Nasir signin' with Jigga
I got rappers gettin' mad at me
I got these new jack rappers tryin' to clap at me
I got these corny wannabe diss song kings on the radio
Talk about how they gon' spray and take me away
But I'm the true living legend, I'm not to be questioned
Have your whole hood holla shit about my progression

[Verse 4: T.I.]
YEAH!
You knowin' my attitude shitty (Okay) only a buck fifty
So I keep the Smittys with me—shit, how many getting it?
(Hey, what you scared?) I'm prepared in the mall and all
With two-twos, you can call me Quick Draw McGraw (Haha!)
You try me, I'ma cut that fool, better call the law
I start sprayin', make fuck niggas fall and crawl (Bow! Bow!)
I press play like Puff, no pause at all
Choppin' holes in all the walls, that's all they saw, hey!

[Verse 5: The Game]
Hip-hop ain't dead, it just took a couple shots
I bring it back to life, give it a couple shocks
The king comin', no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me, but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie, dawg (Nope!) not Waist Deep
I'm not a actor but I'll show your bitch big meat
She givin' one blood, one love, on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week, ugh!
[Chorus: The Game]
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix (Remix!)

[Verse 6: Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces
'Til them niggas lyin' still up in stiff cases
With the Styrofoam and embalmin' fluid
I been gone too long, and I'm dying to lose it
Somebody go and get this nigga a pine box
And I ain't just talkin' 'bout a measly nine shots
Yeah I'm chopper-happy and my wrist loose
Call me Goldie, I'll smack a bitch too

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
504 gangsta, New Orleans soldier
Bangin' underwater, fuck around and soak ya
Louisiana gunner, I'm 'bout my holster
And if you gettin' greasy, I'm an ulcer
I'm bickin' back, bein' bool, on the Eastside
Of New Orleans where the Bloods at the B-hive
Ain't nothin' sweet unless it's Presidential
'Cause that is where I sleep, now give me my key
[Verse 8: N.O.R.E.]
New York, get the blood money (Dirty cash!), still sweet
We the Black Wall Street by the swap meet with heat
Def Jam, they gon' flop him
And Reggaeton ain't hot in the building no more
It's OKAY! I get it poppin'
Back to the forest trees for deep, these little mes
Who took believers a opportunity to breathe
And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak, Queens and get jacked quick

[Verse 9: Jadakiss & Styles P]
One blood, we used to the spillin'
Came from the hood so we used to the killin'
Used to the black males makin' crack sales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling?
Blood in, Blood out, me and homie back-to-back
Boatload of work and we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king, I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfuckin' target, nigga
D-B-L-O-C-K, he spray
The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team, hip-hop's dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen
Yeah, no security, I'll put you on the respirator
I'm the bomb; I'm the motherfuckin' detonator
One dutch, one bud, one burner, one slug
Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just...
(One blood!)

[Verse 10: Fabolous]
(What it look like?) All I say at most
Shooters waitin' on the word, ""Just say it, Los!""
I let these niggas live (Yes!), I told 'em pull the plug
Have them goons pullin' gloves, leave the room full of slugs (Yes!)
Catch me traffickin' on maroon-colored dubs (Yes!)
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs (Yes!)
If they like me, tell 'em line up
While I sit behind ten and point 'em out like a line-up

[Verse 11: Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two (Check!)
I'm strapped, you strapped, let's play two-on-two (Let's go!)
You're eyein' us in the iron bus (Boom!)
Leak you, two liters of red juice: Hawaiian Punch (Ha!)
So what you boys gon' do to me? (What?)
I'm born street, your life's sweet: MTV's Laguna Beach (Damn!)
Mama told me not to play with fire
But she never told me I would grow to be a lighter

[Verse 12: Rick Ross]
One love to the gangs (Yeah!), but I'm in the things
Save the colors for the cars, see, we kill for the fame (Ross!)
The boss made it, yeah, we floss flagrant
Shame how I lost your life savings up in Las Vegas (Ross!)
I'm a heavy better, I'm a heavy seller (Tell 'em)
Keep white in the office, call it Jerry Heller
Lettin' off a hundred rounds (Rounds), let the barrel pick (Pick)
And we gon' sit here and wait for the Darryl case

[Verse 13: Twista]
Chi got Lords and Gangsters, show me where them niggas at
Chi got Two Sixes and Kings, show me where them killas at
Chi got them ballers and hustlers, show me where them figures at
Game, where them triggers at? Aim at them fitted caps
He got the clips, I got the scope, let's get them choppas, nigga!
He got the kush, I got the dope, let's get it poppin', nigga!
Hurt him in that cherry six-four, shit, ain't no stoppin', nigga
Hit him in the head and the body with a bullet
When I put him in the cemetery then I gotta holla out

[Chorus: The Game]
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix (Remix!)

[Verse 14: Kurupt & Daz]
What up, Cuz? Yeah, rollin' with two grips
Glock holdin' on the hip, rollin' with two clips
Got two tiny locos ready to take trips
Shake and make trips, high stakes to take grips (Grip)
But they know what's crackin', cuz, 'cause as we huddle (Ayy!)
They hold cards down, nigga, like spades and pinochle (Nigga)
West Coast gangbang, riders erasin' 'em
Got funny niggas raisin' up and riders replacin' 'em, cuz

[Verse 15: Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
R.I.P. for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices (Woo!), see, them checks better win
Dwellin' in the land of the gangbang profession
I'm legendary, yes, yes, a West Coaster
Throwin' up two Cs with two guns in my holster (Woo!)
I'm from Long Beach City, a Crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga, Game, if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites, anywhere, we can meet
Del Amo to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide (Wide), get swept away by the tide
YGs and BGs, OGs, it's time to ride!

[Verse 16: WC]
Who the riders shooting through the gutter lane?
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes (What up Blood?)
From the Westside, strivin' to dead 'em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowin' blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese, chuckin' up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one blood?

[Verse 17: E-40]
The Bay Area, fuckers, we pop 'em
Open you up if you got a problem (Ahhhh!)
Up top, born in California
Clean your clock, open your can of tuna (Doot-doot-doot!)
Make a choice, it's either Hell or it's Heaven
Get your chest laid out with the FN-57 (Bo! Bo! Bo!)
This ain't nothin' to do with nobody
In the Yay, there ain't nothin' to do but catch bodies

[Chorus: The Game]
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix (Remix!)

[Verse 18: Bun B]
I'm comin' straight up outta P-A-T like Compton in all black
But when we say ""What it do?"", they never say, ""Holla back!""
Bun Beeda, I'm OG, like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club off of Fairfax
Ask the Hundreds, it's doable, I done done it
At the summit of rap, and I'm watchin' you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it, to Bun, it don't differ
Wipe the streets with ya like you a Swiffer as a gift
One blood

[Verse 19: Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngsta that's breathin'
And I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competin' to be competin'
My purpose is to get the cheese
And that's a purpose that you're defeatin'
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet 'til I'm finished eatin'
My label tells me I'm greedy, hoggin' all the room on your TV
Like Eric, they think it's Eazy but it isn't easy, believe me
Need to make a room in B.E.Television if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G

[Verse 20: Slim Thug]
It's one blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug, it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team, but I do it for green
I do it for my Folks, Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers, future rappers, standin' out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood, man, and stack up a knot
Put your sets in the air, scream, ""Fuck the cops!"" (Word, fuck 'em)
We gon' rep for the hood, man, like it or not (Thugga!)

[Verse 21: Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical (Okay)
Cars is improbable, I'm overcomin' obstacles (Okay)
Trappin', I made it logical (Okay), my topic is impossible (Okay)
I got a partner named Shoe Strang 'cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux, cars be tropical (Yeah, yeah)
All guns choppable, all blocks are mobbable (Yeah, okay!)
I'm unstoppable, my Calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, kushin' is now cigarable (What it is!)

[Verse 22: Malice & Pusha T]
Redrum, redrum, such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest, wasn't talkin' to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread, brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave ya
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And revivin' the track like we flowin' through jumper cables
What duo you know
Get XXL kudos while coppin' off Julio?
Yeah, classic shit, we mastered this
Left for dead, I'm back, I'm Lazarus

[Chorus: The Game]
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix
Remix, remix, remix (Remix!)

[Verse 23: Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood, L.A., New York
The Game, the Rule, one love, guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow, it's a bit much
The style, wanna keep up? I'd advise you to speed up
With money movin' like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual-seaters and throw it up
It's all hood, niggas, rep your sets if you Cuz or (Blood!)
Niggas, we all bleed!
These niggas can't breathe!
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want 'em? Come get 'em! Niggas, y'all know where to get at me
Look at me, now pass me, maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughin', bullets stickin' in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one (Blood!)

Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head, do the Wop with me
Go 'head, go 'head, go 'head Game

[Verse 1]
First things first (Aftermath) The Chronic is back
This is indo, produced by Timbo
Game over; nah the N.W.A. chain choker
Is burnin rubber inside the Range Rover
Chain smokin, purple haze
This ain't another one of those, this the rebirth of Dre
The rebirth of L.A., the rebirth of hip-hop
Another memorial for Makaveli and Big Pop'
Hold up, Timb stop - I said
This another memorial for Makaveli and Big Pop'
G-G-G-G-G - young homey got shit locked
Public Enemy #1, Flavor Flav with a wristwatch
All black G-Units, all black Impala
I'm a schitzo, three-wheelin the six-fo'
50 Cent know
I'm Compton's most wanted when I'm ridin with Timbo
[Chorus]
Girl if you got a big back let me bend that
Show me where your friends at, we can flip that
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
I'll show you where the Bloods at, where the Crips at
Show you where they flip crack, where they pitch at
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)
Let me put you on the Game (let me put you on the Game)

[Verse 2]
I ain't got the West on my shoulder, got the West in the backseat
Of the Rover, ridin on dubs, nigga I'm West coastin
The next Hova, from the home of the best doja
Making all that racket, I got the U.S. Open
Stunt on me, I'll leave you wit'cha chest open
Vest broken, hop in the lo-lo with the tec smokin
G-G-G-G-G - I done paid my dues
N.W.A. is back, this is front page news
I got Dre in the back, ridin on 22's
Bitches screamin let me ride, it must be the shoes
Red and black G6's, red dot on the Glock
I'm goin three times platinum dawg, how do I stop? I'm hot

Girl if you got a big back let me bend that
Show me where your friends at, we can flip that

My Unit is Guerrilla
Fuck with my La Familia, I will kill ya
G-G-G-G-G-Unit - I know that boy, not familiar
But you got to feel him if the Doctor sealed him
(Is Compton in the house?) Without a doubt
I'm the rapper with clout other niggas yap about
You know the one that introduce New York to the beach cruiser
Got 'em puttin red and blue strings in they G-Units
Get ""Groupie Love,"" tell 'em to keep movin
If I got a problem with a bitch I let Eve do it
Unless she got on LePearla and I can see through it
I don't just let her ride, I give her the keys to it
Me and my bitch lay back in the Coupe
I'm movin in the neighborhood, I ain't passin through
I woulda been here after Snoop, but I slowed down
To show Timbaland how to iron a khaki suit

Teflon, bulletproof the Lambo (really?)
Hate rats, got my niggas in the fed
Got money in the bank and money on my head
Really? Niggas sound silly
Wanna talk money? Yeah, count it, ten milli
Free my nigga Meek Milly, bad bitch out of Philly
Sold that white girl so I guess I sold Iggy
Who you think I give a fuck about, an enemy?
Think I give a fuck about the industry?
Pussy ass nigga better Google me
Boy I really made a million out the fuckin' streets
Boy I had a white car back in '04
Back in running wood days and ridin' low
When bein' a street nigga really meant something
Now niggas sell his soul for a follow
If you wanna talk streets, what it mean to you niggas?
Take pictures with guns so that make you a killer?
Nah, L.A. Reid gave me that check today
Took that shit to the 'jects, empowered the hittas
I'm Crenshaw at Fatburger, fuckin' with Nipsey
And I bet you I'm rockin' my chains
Or I'm in the Watts with Jay Rock
Or slidin' through Compton with Game
Cause real niggas livin' the same

My partner did a decade so what the fuck you really mean?
Really ho, Billie Jean jackets in my video
Causin' all this racket, no tennis court
Really made a million in a kitchen fork
Skrt, skrt, skrt, skrt, dinner fork
Often offended
I told that bitch there to get out when she finished
Need me a bitch that's gon' suck me and fuck me
And freak me and pass me to all of her friends, that's what it is
Verbal telekinesis, Kurupt mixed with Jeezy
Big Meech mixed with Yeezy
Keep playin' them games and get shot from them bleachers
I still got my stripes when I'm not wearing Adidas
Got a fresh hairline from PETA
Got me a hockey mask, choppers start talking fast
Give it to 'em direct just like Jeter, uhh
Niggas ain't killing shit
Niggas they playing, they saying they killing shit
Got me an A and a K and a 220 trey
And this shit here might burn a little bit

Brand new Benz with the top down
In my old neighborhood, all the cops 'round

Let him and the police hear how the Glock sound
Comin' with the bullshit, get shot down
Sucker free, no fly zone in my town
And there ain't no discussion
It's simple, you try me, we gon' get to bustin'
I promise, my nigga, you want it, my nigga?
My young niggas ready, they goin' on guard
Mm, they act like they know ain't no God
We so official, for sure, no facade
Trap nigga shine like I glow in the dark
Still got my .44 in the door
I'm not finna  play with you, homie get laid with you
Cement your feet, then it's off in the lake with you
Underestimate you, that mistake I couldn't make with you
I hit you with the K myself and show you what the paper do
And can't nobody handle you the way I do
I'll give a boy a K or two, kill you in a day or two
And no disrespect boy
You violate me, know we gon' handle that
Blow your ass off the map
And you still reachin' your hand out for no dap
My demonstration in exchange for your hatin'
I put this flame all in your face, boy you fakin'
We come through in Mercedes
And shoot you, you'd think Call of Duty would make it
Bacon, a nigga medulla off top
He don't give me my moolah off top
Give a damn what the naysayers say
And we waitin' a day in the A with the K and I'm gone

Two ice cubes and some cognac
Spent some time in twin towers, I ain't goin' back
Spent my commissary on some M&M's thinkin' I was Eminem
Runnin' Aftermath in all black
I'll slaughter your house with 5 9's
Leave all of you niggas with crooked eyes
Got the Louisville Slugger, Big Papi Ortiz
Knockin' every button off your buttoned up sleeves
Please that's Jeezy the Snowman
Comin' straight to your window like Bruh Man
Said I ain't killin' your dog but stealin' my hog and fuck my conscience
Puttin' bullets in your doberman, don't fuck with Compton
Don't fuck with Kendrick, don't fuck with Problem
Don't fuck with YG, I'm Mr. Miyagi, Daniel San, I handle them
My handle's dumb, I had no gun
Fuck around, stomp you out in these Durant's or somethin'
I bear arms like Durantula
This rocket launcher'll blow your whole fuckin' mansion up
And everybody gotta die, put them candles up
How you get caught up in the web with tarantulas?
And for you fuckin' dumb niggas, let me slow it down
I can screw you like Pimp and Big Moe around
And when a nigga say ""Timber"", you don't need Ricky Rubio
To let a nigga know it's goin' down, fuck you clowns
Yeah, I put the word on you niggas
Go A$AP Ferg on you niggas
Been all through New York with Diddy
My verse'll Schmurda you niggas
And that's not a shot at TIP or a shot at Gotti
Take shots of Ciroc in a black Bugatti
Got a shotty in a backpack, napsack
Shawty got a black MAC 11, I will catch that body
Like Nasir and Hov when I'm 40 years old
I will still be the pilot that light up the stove
And be cookin' that crack 'til the Doctor come back
And tell niggas that ""Detox"" come out this October
Like Ol' Dirty Bastard, I'm finally sober
And verses like this'll get me a new Rover
Get you a new home and a casket, you bastard
Your funeral boring, I'm glad that it's over

[Verse 1: The Game]
June 30th, 11:07 I got that call
She eight centimeters, my lil' man 'bout to fall
Scuffin my Air Forces, runnin through the hospital hall
Deja vu, like I been here before
I'm feelin reborn, like a Bed-Stuy bredren
My first born, Dre I'm bout to have a Bad Boy
Family in the lobby, see my nigga Church, whatup
Shit, I left the camcorder in the truck
Runnin through the maternity ward, out of breath, sweatin
I swear to God every minute's startin to feel like a second
I see hell starin down the barrel of a Smith and Wesson
My son's ultrasound the closest I ever been to heaven
Lord forgive me for my sins, I know it's last minute
Put the chronic in the air, a lil' hash in it
Spread my wings, if only I could fly
Why fight to live homie if we livin to die?

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
But in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming, your day is coming
I tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running
Running, just keep it running, I tell you
[Verse 2: The Game]
They say every time somebody die, a child is born
So I thank the nigga who gave his life for the birth of my son
11:32, she screamin at the top of her lungs
I'm panicking, nurse yellin for the doctor to come
All I can remember was Lemaze class, breathe baby
One (one) two (two) three (three) four (four)
I see the head, Doc bustin through the door
He between the legs, he see the head, it's my baby boy!
11:46 the head out, she screamin makin crazy noise
Pain is love, my stomach foldin like a La-Z-Boy
I'm feelin like Mariah Carey, all these butterflies
Voices singin to me sound like Teena Marie
I'm callin niggas on tour
Jayo tell Spinz I just cut the umbilical cord
11:57, a soldier is born
And he's flesh of my flesh, young Harlem Caron

[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be
That's all I wanted for you young'n, like father, like son
But in the end I hope you'll only turn out better than me
I hope you know I love you young'n, like father, like son
My little man your day is coming
Coming, your day is coming
I tell ya, and when it comes just keep it running
Running, just keep it running, I tell you
[Verse 3: The Game]
I wanna thank Dr. Aswork and Nurse Teresa
For bringin my baby boy to life, you birthed a Caesar
And my baby momma Alyska, for pushin out a ten pound
Four ounce Mini-Me, I still can't believe it
Nose ears eyes chin, just like your daddy
I'd die before you grow up and be just like your daddy
Or your grandfather; call Uncle Zeb
Tell him I got a son and I ain't even in Harlem
I'm poppin Crist' wit'cha godfathers
Baron Davis and D. Mac, Darrius Rogers
Drop the top on the '71
With my face in the clouds, Lord spare my son
And watch over Eric Wright, T'yanna, and Lil' Pun
Lowridin, bangin, ""Ready to Die,"" track #1
If I bust five times, and they never see the sun
My life is a black hole, like the barrel of a gun

I hope you grow up to become that everything you can be

[Intro: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]
Let me know if you're feelin' lonely

[Verse 1: The Game]
'Cause ain't no real niggas out here
Ye what these niggas start hummin' out their mouth with?
Bunch of bullshit, weak ass albums
Bunch of lil' niggas tryna copy our style
When we originated this, whole motherfuckin' album had hits
That's why we up in the Ritz
That's why I'm up in your bitch, head honcho
Get you killed pronto, wearin' red now, El Segundo
Bail long as Alonzo Mourning
Kill a nigga in his Monte Carlo like Alonzo
Sold records, sold crack, nigga, recognize
For the record, I've been wreckin' shit since '05
No lie, J's on
Take these motherfuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Rewind, J's on
Take these motherfuckas off and throw the Ye's on
Yeezy, tell these niggas that they is slaves
Master want you on red carpet like yesterday
You a house nigga, I'ma get away though
Come back kill master ass like Django
Most you niggas just rapping for the fame though
I start rapping to get the fuck out this durango
What goes around comes around, how that saying go?
Documentary 2, no 50, keep the change hoe
[Hook: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]
Feelin' lonely
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night

[Verse 2: The Game & Kanye West]
Back like I never left, nigga I'm on my second breath
And I got another track from Yeezy
How'd you do that? Like Eric Wright said Eazy
Pull up in my cool whip, I don't give a fuck about it
Leave it at the valet, I ain't fucked up about it
I'll call an Uber, nigga, I'll fuckin' shoot a nigga
I got a white bitch that blow like a tuba, nigga
I just got a new crib, I just got a new Wraith
I just got cooler than LL Cool J
I just got a new gun, squeeze it like some toothpaste
I, I, (aghhhhk)
Spit in the face of a coward
Shit on anybody ever try to take ours
Ye why that nigga's face so sour?
Cause that slick mouth got him wet up like a shower
Now what you know about power?
What you know about dreams?
What you know about freestylin' versus each other
Shelter outside of Nike Town without a dollar in your jeans
[Hook: Kanye West + Sarah Barthel]
Feelin' lonely
Let me know if you're feelin' crazy
I guess all that stuff they told me
In my life was extra shady
I should've kept 'em waitin'
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, no lie
Say hello to the mula
I'm on top, good night

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: The Game]
Met her backstage at a Tiller show
She said I got a reputation, I'm that nigga though
She tryna play hard to get, but I'ma get it though
She say she ain't that type of girl, she sendin' pictures though
She get naked on the Snap 'cause it disappear
I seen that pussy for a sec' and I say, ""Bring it here""
See the way that I'ma fuck you, you ain't ever did
I'ma fuck you everywhere and baby I ain't ever scared
Are you prepared to sit in the club with thugs?
I'm hopin' you there 'cause all that we got is trust
You got friends, they don't fuck with me like that
So in return, I don't fuck with 'em right back
I could have fucked one, I could have fucked two
But I'm only fuckin' you, what you goin' through?
Now you mad, textin' in all caps
Like I just didn't put my kids on your back
[Chorus: Jeremih & Sevyn Streeter]

I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone (aw yeah)
I'm so gone off your love and you know
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone (I'm so gone)
I got drunk off your love and throwed up (bleh)
Pour my heart inside your double cup
Out the park when the first batter up
I got scars from her nails when we fuck (let's go, ayy)
I wanna see your boobs, throwin' you some Jerry beads
Black diamonds in your chain, you a Merry kid
Chrome Heart clear lenses when you lurkin'
Eighty thousand dollar bag, you a Birkin
Workin', 800 in a bag, you ain't worth it
Heard you dropped out of school, was you workin'? (She workin')
No climax from your man? He ain't worth it
Hundred racks on purses, she's mine

Hell yes
Her body talkin' to a nigga, say less
I'm fuckin' up her weave, need a hair net
I'ma put your body on bed rest
Late nights, took her out to Maestro's
She can get the lobster for the backstroke
You know how to love it when I ask though
Make a nigga feel good that it's the last stroke

It’s like that, uh-huh, it’s like that now
That black .45, I gotta put it on

Don’t trip, homie
Yeah, I’m the opposite of Crip, homie

Aventador to the corner store, I whip this hard
Compton God, watch ‘em jump over cop cars
Yeah, I grew up to N.W.A, nigga
And my grannies whipping yay-yay, nigga
[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Come on, don’t trip, homie
Ice grew up around Crips, homie
Where you motherfuckers find this phony?
Acting hard, he’s a tenderoni
The boulevard to the prison yard, I push this cart
Westside rolling, wherever you are
And I been coming up, and ain't none of ya'll niggas running up
'Cause I'm quickdraw when I'm gunning up
Boy you know the sun ain't coming up

You know the deal, greet a nigga on your knees bitch
You heard the talk around town I don't need shit, Compton
Deep water got 'em sea sick
Murder, murder shit and ain't nobody see shit
Bomb weed, palm tree, gold D shit
Who that nigga that said I wasn't gon' be shit?
Cocktail through the window with the indo
(It's what this is) We don't stress them innuendos
(We) Do what we wanna when we want to
(And we) Never hesitated to confront you
(And we) Seen shit as kids
It was normal to us, it might take you
But it might fuck around and haunt you
Shoulda come and see this shit
Give a fuck about no tours, nigga
I want you to come and be this shit
Ren, Cube, Yella, Dre and Eazy-E this shit

Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip
[Verse 5: The Game]
Don't trip, Blood
I make it rain in Compton like it's a strip club
I grew up on Santana block, that's where the Crips was
My mama house was in the middle of the street
How was a nigga supposed to get to school?
I hopped every backyard on my block
Till I got to  Elm Street, took the rag out my sock
And I could have been a Crip but I ain't like blue that much
All Crip school, I ain't really go to school that much
I was selling crack on Elm, bagging up sacks on Elm
With the ratchet in my Bulls jacket, giving you the facts on Elm
King Frog and Big Face, they had my back on Elm
We was fighting over territory with the T-Flats on Elm
I had to scrap on Elm, that's how I got my stripes
Air Max 95s, not a scratch on my Nikes
2016 motherfucker, don't you pull it
'Cause I made it out of Compton with a stab wound and five bullets

[Chorus: The Game & will.i.am]
Don't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh
Don't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh
Don't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh
Don't trip on me oh, don't trip on me oh
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Don't trip on me, don't trip on me
Nigga don't trip

[Verse 6: The Game]
'Cause I'm bool like that, I'm bool like that
I'm bool like that, yeah I'm bool like that
They say ""Game, why you always act a fool like that?""
'Cause I went to Compton High Crip School like that
I was Blood and I ain't really like blue like that
They was Crippin they ain't give a fuck who like that
Them niggas jumped me, why they have to do a 'Ru like that?
Nigga went and got the homies and we flew right back
They C like that, we B like that
We trip like that cause LA sick like that
We Blood like that, we Crip like that
The blunt lit like that, we out

[Outro: will.i.am]
When you ready, lemme know
When you want it, lemme know, I got it
When you see me, congratulate a nigga, don't hate
Niggas will always be niggas, yep, true
That's why I don't trip on these niggas, would you?
Niggas is wild like gorillas that's stuck in that zoo, yep
What happens when niggas unite and start making them moves

[Hook]
My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water
Holy water

[Verse 1]
Back when Michael Jordan was raw
'92 was the year my city was city of God
Coke on the boulevard, crack fiends skiing the slaloms
Is exactly how drug lords found their way from the bottom
Them Yeezy's drop got 'em, couldn't afford 'em you shot 'em
Cause they the same price as fucking red bottoms
We don't pop tags, leave that motherfucker on it
And return it back to the store when you no longer want it
Sleep outside for days for a pair of J's
Then you sleep outside forever cause you got sprayed
If you gon' die for em, they better be number 4's
Or some shit made in Japan you can never find in the stores
Rolex watches, Gucci belts, and Louis luggage
Definitely set us apart from niggas when we in public
Jeffery Campbell and Michael Kors got you looking rugged
Gave her a Louis bag, now she love me
Take a look at her posin' on my car cause
[Hook]
My Phantom so mean
Like I washed that motherfucker every Sunday in holy water
My Jesus piece clean
Even my shoes are Christians, I'm walking on holy water
She came out them True Religion jeans
And fell straight to her knees like she was dipped in holy water
Holy water

[Verse 2]
Met a girl named Christian in some Christian, she a Christian
Suck a dick like sucking dick is her life's mission
Trynna' save her ass like trynna' save a stripper
She fine as fuck, you trynna' fuck, that's the reason you tip her
And all I'm sayin' is a watch and a gold chain
Can't make Bobby Valentino, Johnny Coltrane
And she knows this, that's why her mouth wide
Openin' up her legs straight up like they suicide
I cross my heart and hope to die
If something happens to my voice and can no longer provide
Should I run and hide? No. hustle and survive
Workin' 9 to 5 until sweat drips into my eyes
And if it burns like the kush, then I go back to sellin' pies
Switchin' lanes in that Cutlass, rubbin' her thighs while I drive
Reminiscin' on the days I was rollin' broke
Jesus piece on the rearview, holy ghost
Amen!
[Hook]

Hov invented swag, I'll give him that
But who invented slime about the niggas in the fitted caps?
Reppin Cincinnati, they ain't ever been there
I'm working the track out, no Under Armour gym wear
Fuck bad bitches, check my list, see Kim there
Stacey Dash, I'll smash and pass
And nut on they face like it's skin care
Can't get rid of me, the Game gon' be here
Like teachers with they tenure
No pen here, straight off the dome
I throw a shot, blacka, knock him straight off his throne
That goes for every nigga, the nigga with the lockjaw
And that heavy nigga, I ain't talking about Ross
He the mother fucking boss, I'm the CEO
Niggas using they Skymiles just to see me flow
I've got the Illmatic CD flow
Fake diamonds, fake kaballah beads, nigga CB4
I'm gettin' tired of these niggas, feds puttin' wires on these niggas
I got some Richard Pryors for these niggas
Couple court cases, couple shell cases
Trickling off the ground right next to where the Ace is
I can't take this shit that I'm seeing in the industry
I'd rather be everybody's enemy in the back of the strip club
Guzzling some Hennessy; I really made it rain with Meech
I got memories
Fuck with em here, blow out your memory
Take the roof off of the Chevy, we ride Kennedy
Like a bottle of Patron, one nigga can't finish me
Whoop a nigga's ass, he'll tell the cops there was 10 of me
Ice on my neck, I ain't ever had an injury
Ice on my wrists, I ain't ever had an injury
Meanwhile niggas see me with the doctor
Platinum plates on the Phantom nigga, welcome to the opera!
Welcome to mi casa, shrimp scampi and lobster
Big bowl of OG kush, watching Shottas
Nigga take a hit of that, it's California kush, five
You ain't gotta send it back
Quarterback, nigga I got the center back
Get Charlie Sheen on the phone, tell him to win it back
The summer over nigga, tell them that the winter back
Take that boy crown, bitch nigga, come get it back
Snapback? Fuck that, authentic fitted cap
Nigga talk shit, then it's off with his fitted cap
Off with his fitted cap
Let these niggas know that the boss of the city back
I need a 7 5/8 Philly hat
Rozay, where that nigga Meek Milly at?
Where Beans, where Chris, where Gillie at?
Can't stop bloodin', I'm a fucking hemophiliac
1st nigga on the set with a red rag
Then the industry took my whole swag
Pound sign, dag, and all of you niggas is fucking fags
I dare you come play up on the boy curb
20 niggas with me, can't one of them spell ""hors d'oeuvres""
Pearl handle, but I don't eat oysters
Catch 'em in the hood, 24's on that Porsche
Annulment, had to divorce her
She ain't wanna get in the truck, I had to force her
Heard she wasn't giving it up, you had to force her
Buy homegirl some bottles to intercourse her
Where they do that at? Where my bloods at?
Where my soo woo rag? Where my lil nigga
From where they do voodoo at?
Four albums all number ones, go and Google that
So I'm banned like the number ones
How you try to make it rain with 100 ones
Nigga, I'm married to the game, no cummerbund
Everyday I'm in the Range with another gun
I snipe ya... no Wesley
I'm the king, motherfuck Elvis Presley
I'm the king and I be smoking, dare a nigga come and test me
Put two 9's on your back, Wayne Gretzky
Yo, I'm ahead, they can't catch me
5 to 10 and over, nigga, arrest me
I be out tomorrow, my lawyer'd beat that
Now nigga, go and tweet that
I just did, nigga, re-tweet that
And tell Floyd I've been workin' on the speed bag
He don't fight Pacquiao, then I'm up next
Cut his eyes like Jimmy Iovine cut checks
I'm a millionaire, nigga, fuck stress
Put me on Basketball Wives, it'd be a fuckfest
Shout out to Funk Flex, Shout out to DJ Clue
Shout out to DJ Skee, Shout out to DJ Pooh
He gon' cry when he get in the car
Like I cried blood tears when I was gettin' the star
Like I told Vida Guerra she wasn't gettin' that far
Got some head, then I kicked that bitch up out of the car
But look at the bright side, it was a SLR
And you've been kicked out worse, don't act like I was the first
Then came Amber, alert
You ain't 'posed to talk about a nigga wife, but she squirt
Like a soda can, I can murder this beat if Yeezy and Hova can
So here we go again
Pounds of the kush, and couple of my oldest friends
Last week, I was in my Uncle Otis' Benz
Back it up into the throne, it's totaled then
Only had it for a week, it ain't broken in
I'll prolly never be king, it's kinda soakin' in
Heard I'd never go big, from Napoleon
He had a complex, all I got is concepts
Classics, legendary straight up out the projects
San Diego Aztec, number one prospect
Aston Martin, that's a foreign object
Phantoms, 'rraris, wasn't 25 yet
Lambos, Mazzis, wasn't sayin' 5 yet
17 million, my son wasn't 5 yet
Disrespect the whole rap game and ain't die yet
Hov, lets make a side bet
I'm a J. Cole fan, can a nigga drop next?
(Damn, I mean he got a good thing)
Yeah, call Pay Per View: can me and 50 box yet?
Dr. Dre, can I hear Detox yet?
Yeah, I got some singles on that bitch
Where that ho Maliah at, got some singles for that bitch
Turn on the radio, got some singles on that bitch
Pot of Gold, Me and Kris Kringle on that bitch
Goin' HAM in the club, you should see me in this bitch
Spades bottle tall as Bobby Valentino in this bitch
How it turn into Casino in this bitch
Tell 'em it's Gee Money, I'm with Nino in this bitch
On my toes like a ballerina in this bitch
No Prodigy at Summer Jam screamin' in this bitch
Child prodigy, Bobby Fischer leanin' in this bitch
Alpo ass niggas ain't want to see me gettin' rich
Too late for that though, I got cash flow
Young Fidel Castro, actin' like a asshole
And I don't know better
I ain't know if this a Louis Vuitton or Polo sweater
To me the YSL logo better
Watch a knock-off cause these hoes know better
I made The Documentary, I'll be rich forever
Like my nickname Dick, I'll be rich forever
Pause... now applaud, and let these real Hip-Hop fans count my bars
Let these real Hip-Hop haters count my cars
Back to Swishers, fuck a Cuban cigar
Unless it's handed to me by a Cuban
All these haters on my Dirk so I might as well smoke it with Mark Cuban
Old nigga New York knees, Ewing
Kyrie Irving give a fuck about a 2 inch
Got these bitches giving me brains, so stupid
Finally got the Otis instrumental, had to loop it
New school rapper shot by Cupid, stupid
Everybody sayin' they sick, I got lupus
And I'm still on the block, like the New Kids
I got a few kids, I got a few cribs
I got a new kid so I bought a new crib
2.5 stupid, not a new crib
50 helped a nigga out, but the truth is
All of this shit from one freestyle on Whoo Kid
If I ain't the king, then nigga tell me who is
If I ain't won the west the last 9 years, who did?
I'll wait, while I'm starin' at my Hublot
In my Blackberry looking for bitches that do blow
Used to push weight, like a sumo
Give it to my bitch, let her stuff it in the culot
Take it to the visitor room, give it to Bruno
He nickel bag and slide it in the new box of Uno
But that's too much inf, for the you know
Where I'm from a rat'll never give orders to Bluto
I heard your lil' album, kudos
They say the shit a classic, nigga, I got a few of those
A few hoes, new clothes, like I'm Jason Derulo
So nigga step to the side like a Euro
And a nigga get too close
Louisville slugga to the dome, Pujols
Niggas don't like Game, they a bunch of puntos
I'm sippin' mojitos with Ms. Puerto Rico
Drew League floor seats, Durant shootin' free throws
Back to the spot, left eye in the peep hole
A1 Perico, stay up out my stash
I'm just a middle man, niggas fuckin' up my cash
Police pull me over, now they fuckin' with my dash
2 blocks to go, toss that shit up in the trash
2 Glocks'll blow, put a bullet in your ass
Like Plaxico, got you jettin' up the Ave
I swear to god man, these niggas make me laugh
'Pposed to be my future, you ain't fuckin' with my past
I shoot first, ask questions last
Kobe mind state, why the fuck would I pass?
Boost crime rate, then make Twitter crash
All in one day with my controversial ass
My grandmama SMH my mama like damn
The hoes LOLing and my niggas goin' HAM
Run your lips like Gina, shit get thick like Pam
This a bloodsport, Jean Claude Van Damme
180 bars, man damn
Love Farrakhan but I'm 'bout to go HAM
You hear what I just said? Nigga damn
I love the beef, but I'm 'bout to go HAM
Yeah, hard as a motherfucker
Open my garage, see cars like a motherfucker
Walk up in the club, see broads like a motherfucker
Bitches pulling titties out of bras like a motherfucker
Ace of spades, black card like a motherfucker
You niggas broke, RushCard like a motherfucker
Outside the club plush cars like a motherfucker
And we ain't rent shit, these ours like a mother ucker
But fuck with my niggas, see stars like a motherfucker
Snoop, Busta and Nas they my motherfuckers
2V2's and AR like a motherfucker
Kid Red, Wackstar like a motherfucker
Slept on it but this Otis beat, hard as a motherfucker
Drums weak as fuck, need Mars like a motherfucker
Give a drummer some
Bitch get on your knees and give a plumber some
I'm leakin', sound like Just Blaze in this bitch
Its black wall kiss my black balls, the K's in this bitch
N dot W dot A in this bitch
Game ball hard need a agent and shit
Any one of you niggas can get blazed in this bitch
And we could fight to the death put a cage in this bitch
200 for the Yacht, where the spades in this bitch?
I got them white bitches plankin' like slaves on the ship
Import, export, feds on the landing strip, meet me at the next port
And abort the operation if I text y'all
Nevermind that, my connect be the escort
Let's rewind that, back to my mama Escort
Keys overseas way before I had a passport
Keys in the trunk '95 Honda Passport
I got whatever you need, ain't gotta ask for it
Its a Dillinger in the V stuffed in the dash board
Nigga been fucking with rock, no Damon Dash boy
And it's a damn shame what happened to Dame
He ain't even get to keep his Roc-A-Fella chain
Or the Rocawear chain, or the Armadale liquor
You was already down, nigga ain't have to kick ya
With ya own Pro Keds, in yo forehead
Nigga treats his own friends like the dope heads
Guess he Scarface and you Frank Lopez
This here holy water, put that on the Pope head
Something like a Priest nigga nothing like a pastor
When that R.E.D. drop just prepare for the rapture
Lock me out of Canada, balling like the Raptors
Shit don't even matter, name floating in the rafters
Got the 44 on me call me Tom Raper
Roll it up in the Phantom and blow it up out the Aston
All they see is R.E.D. I'm holding up all this traffic
They tellin' me I'm sick, but I'm sittin' fat like Magic
Bars, Tragic, niggas know im a savage
Won't appreciate it til years after I perish
Be a old nigga ballin' yeah Robert Parish
With a white bitch, cornrows, looking like Bo Derek
Got my white bitch in the hood, I call her Kreayshawn
She better stay between the lines like a crayon
Cause the block is something I spent all day on
Posted up with something long as the nigga Tayshaun
And I'm off probation, so I'm back in the kitchen, Raekwon
This is just a intermission, stay calm
262 Bars, Naplam
Thats 238 to go, this for my unsigned niggas just waiting to blow
I know its niggas 'round your hood just hatin' ya flow
Baby mama in ya pockets steady taking your dough
It's gon' be goons in the crowd, niggas hating your show
Couple niggas hidin' that love, they just hatin' to show
But what don't kill you, only make you stronger
Twenty minute sets, stay on ten minutes longer
I was just like you, still got the hunger
Couldn't see in the dark, feelin' like Stevie Wonder
Waitin' on my turn when Dre pulled my number
I was Spongebob for the next three summers
Then I did numbers, mama I made it
Took the Unit under, still got haters
Die hard fans from Compton to Decatur
Ten million sold, still carry the lasers
Said I still carry the lasers, Lupe what up!
Still got D, G Wall for the blazers
Still pack Heat don't make a nigga D-Wade ya
Don't make me get on my phone and call my pager
Translation them my shooters, Pacers
Niggas say they really got heart, but them is pacers
New West niggas is spitters, razors
Tyler the Creator, K Dot, Jay Rock
Glasses, Crooked, your boy got the bay locked
But me an Tyga got the hoes, Baywatch
Meaning we put on a show, while they watch
Watch us hustle like Nipsey
30 bottles of spades, nigga we ain't even tipsy
So with that rap shit, miss me
All these niggas pussy won't nobody diss me
Nigga I don't blame ya, better do ya history
Every nigga that tried, died a motherfuckin' mystery
Fuckin' with the misfit
You got company I'll kill that motherfucker
See what I did to Fifth shit
That's why I'm always popping big shit
I love New York that's why I'm always bumping B.I.G.'s shit
Kick in the door waving the four four
All you heard was the four four
Niggas jumping out the window on the fourth floor
But the bitch was scared to jump so I put her on all fours
Four albums, four plaques, phantom, four doors
I'm the only five, you niggas is all fours
That ain't a classic album, nigga you off course
You need to call Blaze, Swizz Beatz or Scott Storch
Bon'jour wake up in Paris
Sippin on Conjure mix it with cranberry
Baby what kinds yours?
We up on the top floor niggas
On the bottom we can see a lot more
Baby I'm a problem
If I see a spade and he sippin' on Spades, I'mma call him
Word to my son Harlem
Ya boy used to ski in coke, I'm talking slaloms
Courtside next to Snoop sitting with starlets
I got a thing for red bones and Louis wallets
See the watch making them drool, 'cause its retarded
See the cops pointing at dude 'cause he a target
The world is a shooting range, so I'm aiming at the Shy
And I'mma hit that mother fucker in the newest Range
Hit the south side, doing two and change
Watching Otis so I pulled over and blew the brains
Man its cold out this motherfucker Gucci Mane
Brr, chinchilla fur
Ain't have to move to Texas but I'm in that flying spur
Don't work with Petco but I could flip the bird
Who got snaps on the petro? Word
I'm trying not to hit my 6's on the curb
Nothing like Sonny but I'm driving in reverse
In love with the money, I shall never deter
Probably with the honeys on 54th and 1st
My pimp hand strong from Cali to dirty Jers
Church, tabernacle
Look at ya bird, she laughing at you
Shit is absurd, what happen after you niggas walk out the club?
Them goons start clappin' at you
Sometime short days can turn into long nights
Steve Urkel niggas trying to life Capone life
You seen Menace, don't get caught up at the wrong light
Shooting K's and handguns got a long flight
Yeah, got the lights on backyard looking like Vegas
When the fights on
Hood morning, Hood evening, Hood afternoon for no reason
Buck 50 to the face now you bleeding
Think he Leonidas, 300 while he cheesing
Hop in that 300, tell my niggas we leaving
Tell that nigga laying the ground, we even
No need for oxygen masks, he ain't breathing
Did it with the lights on, Compton raised a heathen
Ain't no fucking witnesses, but everybody seen it
They know what the business is, I'm ripping up subpoenas
Got no love for bitches, all I'm giving them is penis
Got to watch these bitches, they'll take you to the cleaners
They'll starch that ass, they'll press ya
Trying to be Kobe wife, bitch you ain't Vanessa
Bitch you ain't Monica, so what's with all the pressure?
I'm rolling my chronic up, bling on the dresser
Out in Santa Monica banging her on the dresser
I don't do the cuffs, but she wan't me to arrest her
Take another pump then switch the direction
Walk around dolo, I don't need protection
Unless I'm with a groupie, now I need protection
Four condoms came for the thing, I'm on that next shit
Two word minimum, I ain't trying to text shit
Two drinks at Mr. Chow's, now we on some sex shit
Can't get through the door with this whore
She trying to success, she trying to succeed
She trying to blow me, no strings attached she like a Wii
But when the houselights come on she like a 3
Put her face in a bag, from behind she like Free
And I ain't have to buy the bitch a bag it was free
But that's just for me, give it to her like ""Unnhhh"" Master P
Ain't no limit, I go hard as motherfucker
Me and Pacquiao seeing stars like a motherfucker
384 Bars like a motherfucker
All out of breath I should pause like a motherfucker
Nah, I gotta go hard as a motherfucker
Drop top Gotti, foreign cars as a motherfucker
Started off small, living large as a motherfucker
In my rearview I came far as a motherfucker
Rip the head off Medusa and all the blood suckers
Peace to Baby and Slim, them my blood brothers
Shout out to Waka and Jones, them my blood brothers
Shout out to Styles and Kiss, them my other brothers
Shout out to Tune and Ross, them my other other brothers
Sitting here watching the throne, bored as motherfucker
(Lets go)
Time to break the beat down for these clowns
Tell my Uncle Otis he can RIP now
Go to sleep now, my flow senile
And I ain't trying to get locked up, in the penal
System
I can't feel my face, I'm trying to feel the bass
But I got all this Ace in my system
Run circles around you rap niggas
Like I'm doing drills for the Pistons
Sleep comfy but I can still, hear the whispers
Draw steel, 'cause niggas still don't get the picture
Gotta paint it red just so they can see it
If you can't understand colors, nigga Ice-T it
Now bring the bass back, turn up the sneer
Tell the bitches with lace fronts start fixing they hair
And Mars give a nigga a drumroll right here
And right there, yeah...
Back, back, back up on that rap shit
Keep that Louie napsack and that backpack shit
GTFOH, with that snapback shit
Fucking three bitches a night, call it a hat trick
Los Angeles, Kings meaning its more than one
Me and Snoop be doing our thing
And I kinda did away with the bling
Use to walk around every fucking day with the bling
In and out the fucking safe with the bling
Niggas come around they ain't safe with the bling
My shine is mine, catch a case for the bling
Out comes the 9 out the waist for the bling
Put this mother fucker in your face for the bling
Burn your tongue now you ain't got a taste for the bling
80 bars left, whole club sold out
And I'ma get this flow out until their ain't no fucking car left
Until there ain't a Cuban cigar left
See my nigga Dre in here, Yeah he on the far left
Long way from car theft, around the corner from homicide
If you seen the shit that I seen
You probably be traumatized
Remember when my brother died
Thats what made my mama cry
Spent four years alone then my grandmama died
Damn, I ain't never been the same
Pay homage to the woman that gave the world to Game
So the drama it will never die
That's on my mama five
Fuck with my kids or my wifey, that's when the llama fly
Can't afford to lose them
If I had to pick between hip hop or my family
Motherfucker, I'd choose them
As far as rap niggas, I break legs and bruise limbs
Stomp a nigga face in, in some huge Timbs
Niggas don't invite me to shit, I had to move in
Annihilated Bleek, had to tie a couple loose ends
Couple crashed cars, had to lose a few friends
Wifey want an Escalade, I just copped a new Benz
Fuck stock, hood niggas ride new rims
Dubs too small fuck it go on 22 then
22 shrinking now we on 24's
Won't be long til 6's sittin' on that Porsche
Niggas chopping Maybachs, clever, raw
But I'ma chop a Chevy, Mad Max the '64
Bitches love it, niggas like that
Hip Hop was high school punch, I had to spike that
Tell 'Bron and Wade the nigga Mike back
If Uncle Otis rubbed you wrong, go get the ice pack
Undisputed beef king, who the fuck could fight that?
You wanna hit the surplus store, then bring a knife back
Niggas goin' gold, ""shit them is nice plaques""
Finally, get your ass in the ring
Won't fucking fight back
Everybody wants you to swing, go ahead and strike back
Me I'm spitting nothing but flames
I'm like a strike match
Empire Strikes Back, Jedi Mind Tricks
This is how the stars war, why you acting hard for?
Me, I'm hardcore, middle of Darfur
You don't wanna see what the fuck is inside the car door
I got something big under the T-shirt
On the front it say ""Tha Carter IV""
I'm about to order more
Nigga they ain't told you?
It's like the Gulf War
Put a hole in one of you niggas, no par 4
'Rari on the green, got a V12 Ferrari on the green
I be twisting Bob Marley on the green
I took 100 thou just to add another Mazerati to the team
Should of saw me as a teen, facin' the magazine
Any drama, I'm loading up a case of the magazines
Not the Source or the XXL know what I mean?
Rolling Stone, ain't getting my Vibe
So I remain King
At least til T.I. home
As far as the East, ain't no King nigga B.I. gone
Far as bars that four ocho cinco
So the next line is for Ocho Cinco
Easy on the Clicqot, homie don't drink so
I'ma guzzle the bottle and find me a fucking sink yo
Where Otis? Somewhere playing Bingo
Star on my face, I'm a star like Ringo
Ten bars left, su woo is the lingo
All red everything, no visine though
Just left Boston, no Benzino
Hit something out in New York, Bambino
And I coach my team like Pitino
He know, we hit King of Diamonds
Everybody throwing c-notes
On my way to Sin City, pit stopped in Reno
Feeling like Carlito before they casted Pacino
Matter fact fuck him, De Niro in Casino
500th bar, Fuck You; CeeLo3Embed"

But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
Woah, woah
In search of the pot of gold

[Verse 1: The Game]
It's a mother out there right now 'bout to have the next LeBron
Searchin' for a pot of gold like a leprechaun
They say death comes in threes, who's next in line?
And I just lost a best friend for the second time
Now I'm on a quest to find peace
Still gotta carry my piece and, ""Soo Woo!"" when it's reppin' time
Y'all don't understand, I'm misunderstood
Give Interscope two more albums then I'm done for good
Sold 10 million records, ain't leave the hood
It's a cold world, everybody need a hood
And everybody doin' time, stay headstrong
You still got a chance to live even though you did wrong

Oh, the spotlight is not for me

But my haters busy tryna send me home early
But you can't New Orlean Saint me
I ain't a saint, B, I ain't a god, God
I ain't a angel neither, but I try hard, y'all
I'm lightin' up for all my soldiers at war
As I sit back and watch the ashes on my cigar fall
Wayne just came home and Tip back on the yard, dawg
Guess Pujols ain't the only one playin' hard ball

Holdin' my daughter in the booth
Her momma out there somewhere in that Bentley trynna find a roof
Poof, I wave my wand and here comes Kendrick
Niggas say the west ain't winnin', I'm just tryin' to find the proof
Speakin' of Proof, I'm 'bout to roll one with Snoop
Blow the smoke out to your memory and toast to Eminem
Cause he, gave me the shit that I needed on Documentary
Keep it real with myself, I got murdered like John Kennedy
But that was cool cause I was just there for the energy
Watchin' Bizarre pop pills while 2Pac in my hennessy
First time in Detroit, had to rock the Grant Hills
Cause I threw up my dukes when California was at a stand still
But hope ain't lost cause Dr. Dre the man still
Had faith in me, knew I had heat like an anvil
Ran through entire crews, put their remains in a landfill
And I ain't lost the hunger, I'm eatin' out the can still

Yeah, wherever Hov and Nas at in the world right now
I know they listenin' like
This young nigga be killin' this shit
Hip-hop is life's Cîroc I'm 'bout to drop a pill in this shit
Let's go, esco bars nigga, like Nas nigga
The flow is Rakim with the Birdman cars nigga
Hold on I gotta take Birdman's call nigga

New coupe, remove roof
I'm from where niggas'll do your bitch and bitch niggas'll do you
Inevitably we take celebrity bitches and run a chu-chu
We puttin' on magnums, taggin' that wagon, some of these birds kookoo
And murder is what I do to
These Just Blazes, Kanyes, shit on Swizz, I handle my biz
The whole world know what I do to Dre's shit
Niggas know I'm classic, I ain't even gotta say shit
Frank Ocean more of a man than you niggas, get up off that gay shit
Fuck copyin' styles, niggas be tracin'
Whether it's me, the movie, or Jadakiss, niggas just can't fuck with Jayceon
Let's go

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Laa, da da da dup da ah
Thought you love me before
I'm glad to kill it some more

No matter how hard you try
Can't buy freedom
We're far from being free
Yea we're far from being free
We're far from free
[Verse 3: Game]
Wanna welcome everybody to Jesus Piece
After my album fades, my competition will lyrically be deceased
Niggas saying I'm underrated
Like a younger Jay with heat, but not the ones the Thunder play with
So Los Angeles King is sort of an understatement
Let me find a gun to play with, I leave you niggas under pavement
Tell 'em they rent's due, pay up or get cement shoes
All this dope be around, you act like I ain't lean on that fence too
But now European bitches and cars is what I'm into
You wanna send me to God, I wear 45 in that French shoe
I fuck with Wale, Ross, and my nigga French too
And me and Face just slashed the last beat up like a ginsu
My album like a 'Rari, a lot of dope features
Glad you bought it, now sit back and just blow reefer
I know the concept behind it is gon' reach ya
Now turn this motherfucker up and blow speakers

Ladies and gentleman
I would like to introduce to you
An incredible gentleman
He goes by the name Elijah Blake
Let's go

Ay man, look

First of all Game, shouts out to you
You put your foot in this album's ass
Here's the thing man
This is your public service announcement for free
This is from me, to you, and everybody who listens to this album
At the end of the day, man, you can't be judged
If you a man to God, then be a man to God
If you a nigga from the streets, god damnit, be a nigga from the fucking streets
At the end of the day, you are who you are
God made you for a reason, man
Now I'm not saying go kill nobody
I ain't saying go smack ya lady in the face
What I'm saying is, be who you think you are, man
Don't mix that shit up
At the end of the day, look
Am I perfect? No
Do I want to be perfect? No
Does God know I'm not perfect?
Well that's a fucking question mark, cause here's the thing man
Cuz I'm praying at the wrong times of the day
That's weird, and I'll talk to you about that later
But man bottom line what I'm saying is this dude
Be you do you, can't nobody judge you but you
And at the end of the day if you doing hat you supposed to
Then fuck it man!

Um, yeah
Palms sweatin' guess it's time for the murder
My nigga my nerve, I swerve left you dead on the curb
Tell his family get them black clothes
Any witness gets a 9 cold, could do this with a blindfold
I'm that player on the corner lookin' dry when it rains
Pimp a dollar out a pussy, I ain't tryin' to change
Far from average, I'm smokin' this cabbage
Bottled teeth, joint Karats, say cheese, make the cops freeze
Big cribs, for bars, livin' by the dreams
You only gangsta through your bop screen
My set the reason for the Crime scene, fill up the city with madness
We the reason the hearses left your hood and holdin' up traffic
Let the riddles do the scrappin', keep the gun in my fabric
Better pistol than them badges, you get dealt with the maggots
Heard drive-bys everyday, seen homies die early age
Though we still gang bang anyway
Uh, yeah, Figg side

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh

B's and them H's, tats on faces
Glocks with extendos, chuckin' up the hood
Then throw like 80 out that window the chopper make you limbo
Gotta keep them antennas up, moving down Central
Young niggas with skinnies, moving with them semis
Catch your ass leavin' the club, murk you at Denny's
Squeeze till it's empty, it seems so unreal
'Till the Gunfire got you using tables as a shield
East side, west side, niggas getting chastised
Droppin' like fruit flies, we all know who died
We all go on Insta and get the whole rundown
A 15 second clip until he put the gun down
Know OGs who took more shots like diabetics
Had that MAC paint on your face like cosmetics
Chucking up big ass Bs is my fetish
Type of shit that make you go brazy if I let it
Niggas got zippers, wheelchairs and prosthetics

Hundred days, hundred nights, nigga
Let the K scream till we see the red and blue lights, nigga
From the Hoovers to the Hundreds, nigga
From Kelly Park to Bounty Hunters, nigga (Watch out for the shooters)
Same age as the kids in Iraq now
LA Chiraq now, funerals is packed now
Preachers at the pulpit, Jesus is the background
Grandmother get shot walking out the church, how that sound?
Niggas don't really like it but we grew up in it
City of angels, belly of the beast get chewed up in it
Started as Black Panthers, everything power, everything pro black
Started off unified, the FBI know that
A little coke sprinkled on tables but wasn't no crack
False imprisonment, Huey P, Geronimo Pratt
Now close your eyes, listen to me, your mind'll go back
Picture us chained together under the boat, that's a Kodak
And since today is Thursday, let me hit you with a throwback
Stolen identities, God left us here without LoJack
Forced to find ourselves, forced to break up outta chains
Got tired of getting hanged so we started our own gangs
Tookie Williams (Crip), Sylvester Scott(Blood)
Seventy two Lil' Country caught a slug
And that was the first time a crip ever killed a blood
Now the shit is worldwide cause it is what it was
We know the history and we know the shit could end any day

Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Crips, primarily African American gang
Though we still gang bang anyway, uh
Founded in Los Angeles, California 1969
By Raymond Washington and Stanley Williams
Though we still gang bang anyway
Today there's over a million Crip members worldwide
Associated with the blue bandana
Bloods, also primarily African American
Street gang founded in Los Angeles county city known as Compton
By Sylvester Scott and Benson Owens
A mission he formed to provide members protection from the Crips
Today there's over 5 million Bloods worldwide
The government still can't contain us
And our fate was sealed forever
When 17 year old LA brim Frederick ""Lil Country"" Garrett
Was murdered by west side Crips on June 5th, 1972

I got 'em in every color, yeah I'm a known stunner
When I hit a switch I get higher than long jumpers
Lowridin with a hood rat or a grown woman
I'll do anything - but I won't fuck Mariah
Even if she had Ashanti butt naked in bed
Cause she got a fo'head just like Tyra
I can say what the fuck I want
You thought Dre retired, left me a six-fo' and his Dayton wires?
These niggas is a waste of rhymin
Doc got somthin to say be quiet
(Look out for Detox)

Show you how that low rider bounce off the flo' - You ain't know?

Been holding this pain inside for so long
Though the rain never goes away
They say I should leave these streets behind me
But it's so hard to escape
Oh Lord please send me an angel
To lead me out of this place
Take me away, away
Far away, to better days

[Verse 1: The Game]
First thing I wanna do is say ""What up"" to T.I
King of the south, now everybody see why
I'm just driving and thinking how I survived here
And I ain't seen Dre and Eminem in five years
That sound Shady right, I live a crazy life
So many black thoughts I had to paint the Mercedes white
I could tell you 'bout the rims, but I ain't here for that
Going out like Big and Pac, I fear for that
Take this Lambo, and put six holes in it
Shut up the glass and leave my body exposed in it
Lift the doors up and let all of my demons out
And I can see my brother now cause that's what I've been dreamin 'bout
I ain't thinkin 'bout bitches or pulling Beamers out
I'm thinkin 'bout my sons' safety everytime they leave the house
I know how to make it out the hood, I seen the route
And here's the proof, me, Venus and Serena out
[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Game]
I'm sittin on these stairs at this church, 'bout to start a verse
And somewhere in the world, somebody 'bout to start a hearse
Tell me who inside it, Who's son is that
And how he get there, now tell me who gun was that
I ain't saying confess, definitely ain't saying snitch
But if you killed the nigga, help his mama dig his ditch
I'm from a hood where niggas gotta keep they gun cocked
And kids wear Dre Beats to stop the sound of gun shots
But at least they got the Dre Beats
Cause kids in Africa ain't even got shoes on they feet
And I seen it with my own eyes
At the same time I'm picking flies off my own eyes
Can you feel that, If you can hear 'em buzzin
You can feel the pain of Mike Tyson and his baby mother
They lost they baby daughter, and she was only three
She never got a chance to blossom on the family tree

[Hook]

Verse 3: The Game]

We got a new president and I love that he black
But I'mma ask him like Bush ""Where the soldiers at?""
Now move the camera to New Orleans ""Where the soldiers at?""
The water dried up, well nigga do the Nolia clap
We all juveniles, we all been through some trials
And some tribulations, I'm in this booth pacin'
What do I say next, should I talk about some cars?
Or the next chapter of my life and show you all my scars
All my bullet wounds and my stab wounds
I can't show you, I covered 'em up with tattoos
I can't do nothing but spit the truth
On probation, smoke and drink Patron before I hit the booth
You makin' songs for the club, when niggas drinking
I make 'em for the ride home, when niggas thinking
One minute you here, next minute shit is tragic
And this a Jim Jonsin track, now feel the static

No feelings for a ho, that ain't my main thing

Bitches do too, this is my boo
Two C's on that bag but she throw up Piru
And we off that Cîroc, she don't mind if I do
Her girlfriend a thot, tell her hop in my coupé
Tell her hop in my bed, tell her hop off my roof

Pop the pussy, don’t play with it
I don’t care if Kanye hit it, I don’t care if Jay hit it
I’mma eat it up and I’mma lay with it
We shot a chopper at the gun range
Got stupid cars, got dumb change
Red bottoms, let the tongue hang
Got an off-white Porsche, cum stain
I’m whippin’ work (I remember)
Roll up that purp (I remember)
Pour up that syrup (I don’t remember)
(How Tunechi had that purple Slushy comin’ out that blender)
Got a Keisha, got a Rhonda

Dropped it off to my Auntie, told her hold it

87 did 30 mil', wonder what Coogi think
Quarters, 9 1/2 sold  (I remember)
Yeah, it’s the middle of June, and it’s snowing like December

I taught myself how to spit from listening to It Was Written
My first bars wasn't dope but I had that in the kitchen
Suge wouldn't listen, Irv wouldn't listen
So I ran around with Diddy, Aftermath in the Mission
I would never ask another man for permission I do me
Fuck the Illuminati, I'd rather ride around in hoopties
But now it's the Ghost, my gold Ds is two threes
Still hop in the freestyle, kick it like two Bruce Lee's
Cut open the noose leaves
Foreign on the hill like it's Lauryn
Smoking la la like the Fugees
Thinking to myself, is it God or Lucy?
Prada or Gucci, popping Cris', Rihanna, Karrueche

I'm like sixteen Jay's but the beat I can manage
So every sweet 16 is like Duke and Kansas
You bout to lose advantage, I will come through crews and bandits
Bruise and damage, fuck your rules and manners
I kick back, click clack, bump the Wu in Phantoms
Fuck rap, I only respect Ja Rule and Hammer

Are we gonna die? Are we gonna die?

Light a blunt, throw on Nas, collect my thoughts
Blow the candles out as I contemplate in the dark
Dumpin' ashes on the fuckin' Time magazine
Tryna burn a hole between Israel and Palestine
All this world news, all these dead bodies
All these kids dying, the talk of illuminati
As I'm murderin' ink, I get a call from Irv Gotti
Say ""Keep spittin' cause when you do it's like a 12-gauge shotty""
Got machetes and them cannons loaded up
Got them Xany's and that lean in my cup
These politician's can come up missin', I'm on a mission
You hear them gun shots, now mother fuckers listenin'
Feel that you can take their life cause they ain't got a pot to piss in
Raise the Christian, kill you for these kids as victims
Fuck the system
You give a kid 30 cent and think you sponsor somethin'?

What if we ran through Beverley Hills, got 70 kills
Ridin' down Rodeo in the Chevy with pills
And pop one, load 12 slugs in the eagle
And shot one, Donald Sterling hopped in his Benz
I got one, beam on the back of his dome
Palm sweaty on the back of the chrome
That's my adrenaline
So we purge Sandusky, purge Zimmerman
Purge every mother fucker rapin' women in
Purge niggas killin' kids, back to back in two vans
Me and my mercenaries, middle of South Sudan
Carryin' babies bodies, long as I got two hands
Long as I got two feet, millions and my crew deep
We purge for the families, they deaths ain't in vein now
Crash my ass, niggas know who shot that plane down
Two hundred and ninety eight innocent lives severed
Flyin' on Aaliyah's wings all the way to heaven
And so we Purge

Imagine going to the stores without cops harrasing
Imagine Mike Brown walkin', them same cops just passed 'em
I'm smokin' hash, and let me ash it before I talk in past tense
I hope his mama tears is like acid to your fuckin badges
2 shots in his brain, 4 in his fashion
Thinkin' 'bout his casket in this Phantom, swear I almost crashed it
That's why I'm headed to Ferguson with this German ruger
Cause I'm probably more like Nelson Mandela than Martin Luther
More like Ice T than Ice Cube, I'm a cop killer
Murder all the cops, then the cops will probably stop killin'
On my knees prayin', wish my nigga Pac was livin'
But he fell victim to the Rampart Division, purge
Cops killed Biggie, cops beat up Rodney King
We tore up the city nigga, purge
Or just stand there like J. Cole
And shoot at cops in the same spot till the case closed, purge

Crazy how he mournin' his wife's death and I'm celebrating my son's life
I'll never understand death, shit

I'll never understand

I felt abandoned like Quik now that Mausberg gone
So I don't hop in the SS without the Mossberg homes
I've been rappin' for a year and a half, my life is real
Put the gun in his mouth, he gon' bite the steel
Come to Compton, I got stripes for real
Before Dre, before the ice, before the deal - I was almost killed
Like 'Pac before the Death Row deal
I got shot over two pounds of weed, still ain't found them niggas
But karma come quicker for a nigga on the other side of the gun
That's somethin I gotta teach my son

[Hook: Faith Evans]
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
'Cause, the, game, don't, change
[Verse 2: The Game]
I heard they got Bloods in New York now
Red rags in Uptown Harlem now, I need that love
Front court at the Knicks game, new chick, French name
New car, new house, and sometimes friends change
And you don't need that love, when you G's like us
And your Jesus piece is sim-u-lar to Biggie's
And your life story is sim-u-lar to 50's
First they hate you, then they love you, then they hate you again
What the fuck do it take for a gangsta to win?
No mics, no Unsigned Hype, nigga fuck The Source
Plus them awards I don't need
And them niggas breathing the same air as me, acting like they don't bleed
We don't drive the same speed, this a Continental T
That's a case of Armadale, this a continental suite
So I'mma drown in my own sorrows
Live life, fuck tomorrow, nigga 'cause reality is

[Hook: Faith Evans]
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love
'Cause, the, game, don't, change
[Verse 3: The Game]
I was gassed up, Murder Inc., Roc-A-Fella passed up
Sat in Daddy's House with Black Rob and Lou and asked Puff
Now The Game's set in stone, the Franck Muller's set in stones
Dre cut me a check, I'm gone
Tryin' to be the king of the streets, niggas'll wet your throne
But I got nieces to feed, two coasts to please
So I roam through the city like the ghost of E
Gotta put Compton back where it's 'sposed to be
Nuthin' between all my niggas that's close to me
In the streets with two fellas packin' toast for me
I'm 'posed to be, got all the critics watchin' my pivot
On my block in the Coupe readin' kites from prison
I got niggas doing life in prison
All my fallen soldiers is one of the reasons we pour out liquor
So this song is for Ms. Wallace, Afeni Shakur
And all the mothers of dead sons that went out in the war

[Hook: Faith Evans]
I don't need your love, no no no no
I don't need your love
Need it, I don't want it, I don't need it
I don't need your love, no I don't need your love
I don't need your love

[Verse 1: Game]
Jacob sold me my first couple pieces
I was killing niggas who misunderstood what diseased is
Spent half a mill on a Ferrari, I coulda leased it
Driving Scott Storch's Bugatti 'fore they released it
Drop The Documentary, rockin' khakis with creases
Dope and hip-hop, it resurfaced with some leeches
Ten times platinum, now I'm chillin', where the beach is?
Time to show the world, what a motherfuckin' beast is
Blanca, bulletproof cars in Sri Lanka
Twelve years old, on his shoulder, a rocket launcher
Ten thousand miles away, there's an owner of a corner store
A white man walks in, spit shinin' his Audemars
While somewhere in Africa, Jo-Burg and Congo is goin' to war
Rebels enslavin' they own people, diggin' water or
Get murdered 'cause that choppa is a carnivore
He found one and stole it, now the village tryna find that boy

How you sellin' the shit our people is diggin' for?
Diamonds, cotton, that belong to niggas though
LeBron and Durantula gave America a look at gold
And what you give us back, is another fucking liquor store
And we need blunts, so we walk in that motherfucker
Money in the safe, so we in that motherfucker
But you can't forget the tape, tryna pin a motherfucker
DA ain't got a case, I'ma win that mothercuker
And it ain’t about the Chinese, dude, I eat Chinese food
Where you think Michael Jordan find these shoes
We robbin’ each other for 'em, think I should hide these jewels
Run up on you in broad day with them Siamese tools
But nah, Mandela did twenty-eight straight
Without a fucking complaint, put an afro on a Saint
Put a wig on a judge, put a nigga in some chains
Over change, kill him, lethal injection inside his veins

John Wilkes Boothe killed Lincoln and you thought he freed slaves
What the fuck was you thinkin'? Nigga fuck Lincoln
I’m rolling up kush in my Lincoln, now let it sink in
Rolled against Obama now you divin' in the deep end
I’d rather take my chances at this water fountain drinkin'
Where the fuck is the loyalty, knock these niggas fuckin’ teeth in?
In the hood singin' like they Aubrey or The Weeknd
Pull that towel from under that door, and let it seep in
There's a lot of shit I don’t like, so bring Chief Keef in
I don’t like these phony ass jewelers with that fake shit
Overcharging niggas an arm and leg, just to make shit
And you wonder why we take shit, y'all put us on slave ships
That’s the reason we hate shit, rob our own niggas for them

[Verse 1: Game]
Once upon a time in the projects, yo
I watched my Uncle Greg put Ds on a '6-4
I washed it on Monday so he bought me a gold chain
Chopped crack and watched ""Colors"" so I soaked up game
Drove the Impala on his lap, that was my role model
Used to let me kill the corner of his 40 ounce bottle
On the weekend him and my Pops flashed a 'Vette
Til' one weekend my uncle got stabbed to death
He got murdered by a fiend, my pops ain't like that
He was from Nutty Blocc, they used to call him Maniac
Crazy ass nigga, with a Black Panther tat'
Kill a nigga, cross him out on his Compton hat
Told me when I got older, I would understand that
It's blood in, blood out, and ain't no turnin' back
Few summers went by and we moved across the tracks

I was the first nigga with a Starter jacket on the block
Used to build model cars and make them motherfuckers hop
Moms banged Hoover Crip, she was known for sellin' rocks
Let me collect the 40 ounce bottles in the dope spot
Bought my first Converse, thought I couldn't be stopped
When I creased up my khakis and threw on my Ronnie Lott
Used to think that I was hard, so I stole my brother's Glock
And that's the day my life changed, 'cause that night he got shot
Killed by another Crip over his Rolex watch
I got high for three years off that ""Chronic"" from the Doc
I was drinkin' 40 ounces a lot
And every liquor store in Compton sold out the day Eazy dropped
I start bangin' red laces in my A-di-das
Drinkin' out a brown paper bag on my first drive-by
I was a menace to society

I got a lot of dead homies, some Blood some Crip
This is life, stop watchin' that ""Boyz N The Hood"" shit
You see this red rag hangin' outta my jeans
I went to 20 funerals by the age of 19
Then I went to college, basketball was my dream
Quit the team, 'cause I'd rather shoot rock with the fiends
Wanted to be Freeway Rick
He showed me how to turn a stolen 5.0 into a brick
Bought a Cadillac, thought I was rich, bangin' DJ Quik
On Crenshaw got jacked for my shit
Took a long chronic hit, and thought about the time
When I was 12 years old and I emptied my first clip
Hit my first switch, same night fucked my first bitch
Thought I was dreamin 'til I pinched her tits
She caught a stray bullet ridin' shotgun in my shit

Pull the rag off the six-fo'
Hit the switch, show niggas how the shit go
The Game is back, the Aftermath chain is gone
The Ds is chrome, the frame is black (So watch it lift up)
'Til the motherfucker bounce and break
And knock both of the screws out the licence plate
Let the games begin
These other rap niggas so far behind me could taste my rims
Shit, let the chronic burn as the Daytons spin
It ain’t been this much drama since I first heard Eminem
In the club, poppin' X pills like M&Ms
Call it Dre day, we celebratin', bitch bring a friend
Bottles on me, tell the waiter to order another round
And put that cheap-ass Hypnotic down (Put your ‘cris up!)
If you feel the same way
Who got 'em hittin' switches NY to LA

[Chorus]
(If I could fit the whole hood in the club)
Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back
(I turn it into a strip-club)
Call it a lap-dance, when the six-fo' bounce that ass
(If I could fit the whole world in the club)
Tell the DJ to bang my shit, the west-coast in this bitch
(Pop bottles and twist up)
Roll up chronic and hash
In a blunt, call it Aftermath

Somebody tell me where the drinks at, where the bitches at
You fuckin' on the first night, meet me in the back
I got a pound of chronic, and a gang of freaks
Move bitch! Who the fuck you think they came to see?
The protégé of the D-R-E
Take a picture with him, then you gotta fuck me
And you gotta fuck Busta, can’t touch Eve
Got somethin' in my waist that you can’t touch either
That’s, my gangsta bitch, and like Crips and Bloods
I’m in the club on some gangsta shit (So nigga twist up)
Light another dub
Bitches get scared when niggas start fightin' in the club
Ain’t nothin' but a g-thing, baby it’s a g-thing
Bounce like you got hydraulics in your g-string
I fuck a different bitch seven days a week
Hit the switch, watch it bounce like a Scott Storch beat

Hop in the low-rider, long as you got bitches in the back

Niggas thought I wasn’t coming back, look at me now
Hoppin' out the same Cherry six-fo'
With the motherfucking top down, I'm The Game, nigga
Call your bitch, she ain't home, she with Game, nigga
Remember that, Dre you passed me the torch
I lit the chronic with it, now the world is my ashtray
Ridin' three-wheel motion ‘till the ass scrapes
Turn sunset into a motherfucking drag-race
Now watch it bounce
Hit the switch, let it bounce till the police shut the shit down
(When you hit the club)
Tell 'em you came with me (We gonna twist up)
In the V.I.P
It’s a new day, and if you ever knew Dre
Motherfucker, you would say I was the new Dre
Same Impala, different spokes
Same chronic, just a different smoke

[Intro: The Game & Diddy]
I put that on Piru
Yo Game, let's go

[Chorus: The Game]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA
Bandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 1: The Game & Diddy]
Ran the west for a decade nigga, check the bio
Gave you Cincinnati fitteds like I get it in Ohio
Autographs on the vinyl made the Lamb albino
Straight away in the Wraith, that's a Peyton Manning spiral
You lookin' at your idol, Jesus wrote the Bible
Yeezus, that's my Nike town rival
Dare a nigga try me now, like why me now
Lookin' for Red Octobers, I will tie him down
Stay laced, spit nothin' but based, yeah
All my shit bump like Craig Mack face
Ask your favorite bitch how my dick taste (Baaaaaaaaddd Boyyyyyy)
Ask your neighbor's bitch how my dick taste
Don't take orders, I dictate, get your shit straight
Dickface, perpetual Rollies with the big face
I got 'em lovin' the movement
Beard so long, I'm feelin' like Rick Rubin
[Chorus: The Game]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA
Bandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out

From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
In a 64, 6'5, too big for a Bugatti
That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Verse 2: The Game]
Top floor at the Biltmore, say they want a
War, shit, that's what I'm built for, loungin'
Miami with the eye candy
Bitches names Sandy and Bambi, my exes can't stand me
God blessed the nigga with more swag than Jigga
More hoes than Trigga, Trigga know, that's my nigga though
Figure four down, Figueroa, Ric Flair
Phantom, all red flannel, niggas don't hit me though
Spit on models, R.Kelly, piss on the center fold
Ever since Doc showed me a billion in a envelope
Love Jimmy, fuck Interscope, I'm a don
Walk outside, naked, Cuban cigar and Louboutins, huh
Shit on my lawn, snakes in the grass
I hear 'em slitherin' and hissin' whenever I pass
Ridin' with somethin' French; Khloe Kardash'
Two-hundred on the dash, that's your ass
[Chorus: The Game]
I've been shot stabbed, left for dead, walked through every hood in LA
Bandana on my head, guarantee that shit was red
Machetes and them choppers out, bitches with their knockers out
I done fucked 'em all, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga
From the corner playing lookout to kitchen cookouts
Yeah, that's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

That's why I'm standing on Ferraris, nigga

[Outro: Diddy]
Yo, this nigga Game bought me a motherfuckin' red Ferrari for my birthday, nigga. (I put that on Piru) Told me I was honorary. (Put that on Piru)
I said, nigga, I'm with whatever with this motherfuckin' red Ferrari, nigga. Yeah, I'll take it
Nigga, Game givin' out red Ferraris for no reason, it was just a Tuesday
A motherfuckin' Tuesday. Niggas said happy Tuesday, Puff
Now that nigga wanna stand on my Ferrari every day
Now that nigga wanna stand on my motherfuckin' Ferrari all the time
Drivin' down the street with Hype Williams shootin' a video. We ain't even shootin' a video, we just motherfuckin' ridin' down the street, this nigga got Hype Williams shootin' and shit
See this what happens when that East meets West, we get together, know what I'm sayin'? Say fuck the rest, we start partyin' and bullshittin', havin' a good time, throwin' pool parties and shit
Niggas start buyin' niggas from the East Coast Ferraris and shit, shit all good, red Ferraris at that, nigga

Doughboy: Shit! Rick! Come on, man!
Tre: Ricky!
Help me! Help me! Somebody, help me!
Ricky, Ricky!
Ricky!

[Verse 1: The Game]
Blood of a slave, heart of a giant
Had to leave Aftermath, Dre said I was too defiant
That was five years ago, look how fast it go
Destroyin' Interscope, shot myself like Plaxico
But fuck that, blaze one, where the matches, yo?
Hit the freeway and see how fast the Aston go
Roll the window down, clip off the ashes so
You can see all my diamonds and how much cash I blow
How many bitches I fuck, how many cars I drive
How many goons I got, count 'em and they all outside
Niggas try to shut me up like Malcom
But standin' in the window K smokin' was the outcome
Sometimes I get a little stressed and pop a Valium
Hit Hollywood late night and knock down a stallion
So niggas think twice 'bout my medallion or
You'll hear Cuba Gooding yelling ""Ricky!""
My nostalgia is a hunnid percent Compton, zero percent snitch
Park a Bentley and the Phantom on blocks where I used to pitch
Made the Cincinnati fitted more famous than Griffey did
And just to think, several years ago they tried to split his wig
Two to the chest, struck his heart, one hit his rib
Then I blacked out, like a movie, all I could hear
[Interlude: Boyz n the Hood (1991)]
Come on, let's get 'em, let's get em
Get 'em, man, get 'em
Cut him off, pull right here, cut him off
Go, man, go

[Verse 2: The Game]
Feelin' all fucked up, woke up to a doctor
All I could think about was if the cops took my weed and my choppers
They want me to sing like Sinatra,
I told the detective get this clear like Belvedere vodka
Them five that shots then created a monster
Hell's Kitchen comin' straight out of Compton
I seen Boyz n the Hood, Morris Chestnut was a actor
2Pac was the real life ""Ricky!""
Then they shot down the nigga that shot him, swear to God
If I'm lying then Compton is New York and I'm Rakim
I'm from where niggas get murdered over stock rims
And punched in the jaw just for a cocked brim
Nobody mama let the cops in, we ain't got no options
Wanted to be a boxer, but I was boxed in
Then my grandmother house went up for auction
And that's what what killed her, I'm goin' back to buy the block then
Too many niggas locked in, dig up Cochran
And defend all my niggas ith they face under stockings
Rather face God than 25 with no options
If Compton ain't the murder capital, we in the top ten
Drive by with our face painted, like a clown
With a tre-pound, forty shells bouncin' off the ground
This how my livin' room sound, when my brother got shot down

Gucci in my closet, pardon my head
Pardon my French, but I’m on my Nas shit, off with your head
Off with your bitch, she offered me head, I offered her dick
Slid my black card at the reception, now we off in the Ritz
I’m rolling this kush, she coughing and shit
Freak bitch named Jada love the LOX, I got her talkin’ to Kiss
Got my hands behind my head, now she all in the splits
Dick must be good ‘cause now she in Boston with bricks
Got a text on my iPhone, she caught with my shit
Offered her ten, she took it ‘cause she’s far from a snitch
Hold her mama and her daddy down, got a sister at Georgetown
Paying her tuition so she ain’t gotta be strippin’
It’s money so I ain’t trippin’, this bullshit get printed
Them banks get scoped out, black cars get rented
My Gucci suit tailored, my fade get tapered

Hard bottom Ferragamos, IQ too much for mediocre convo
I know what Farrakhan know, three-story condo
IPod shuffling between Common, Jay Electronica and Bono
Our motto, the last words of Paul Castellano
Nothin’ but endless paper and bitches for niggas I know
Smokin’ Cheeba, feeding divas McDonald’s
All the way in Milano, ashin’ out Cohibas
Fuckin’ in that blue Aventador, the nose like Gonzo
Let a bitch get a breather, then she back hittin’ high notes
Throwin’ Louis luggage at dealerships, fuck a car note
15’s in everything, beating like Harpo
Rolling purple like Harpo, bitches by the car load
They wanna see Prince, I’m pulling strings like Carlos
Santana, now we in Magic, Atlanta
Wipin’ Ciroc off my Loubi’s with my Gucci bandana, cuz I...

I'm a motherfucking gangbanging nightmare, wake up motherfuckers
I traded in my white Nike Airs
For a red pair of Converse, back to the hood
My own niggas acting like I turned my back on the hood
I used my rap money to put crack in the hood
Even brought the nigga Dr. Dre back to the hood
I showed niggas the Bentley then let you drive it
Gone for two days and I ain't even check the mileage
When we was fighting with Crips it wasn't about no dollars
It was about selling dope to put our kids through college
I'm sitting on the block, reminiscing for hours
Wiping my tears cause now half of my niggas is cowards
And I was still fuckin with niggas
After I got shot and didn't get one hospital visit
My homey Snoop told me it'd be days like this
It hurt my heart, to say this shit

[Hook]
[Verse 2: The Game]
Red bandana in my back pocket, I'm for real
This ain't a pastel color khaki suit, and I ain't Pharrell
I don't front about shit I pull my gun up out shit
And let everything fly to keep my son up outta this
I thought you loved me nigga, talk is cheap
Remember, the bulletholes in my son's car seat
My baby momma found four shells
I ain't get one ""keep your head up,"" all I got was ""keep it real""
'Keep it real' my niggas?
Last year alone I spent one point five mill' on my niggas
After the bullshit, I stayed right there
Took you to award shows, there go Jay right there, where? Right there!
I had all you niggas in suits, cleaner than a pair of fresh Nike Airs
I'm supposed to enjoy this shit but it's quite clear
The last twelve months been a fucking nightmare

This shit worse than arguing with my bitch
I done been through mo' ups and downs, than the Impala switch
Get yo hand out my pocket nigga, go fish
I was born by myself so I don't owe y'all shit
Nigga you tell me, what you want me to do
Drop my son off at home and come bang wit'chu?
Oh now it's fuck Game, nah nigga fuck you
I put that on my life, matter fact, that's on Piru
And the reality is, I could die too
And end up in the cemetery, right beside you, we can both rot
Angels flying over my headstone, but the devils inside yo' box
You wanted my shine so I gave you ice
Then I gave you a second chance and you played me twice
Couldn't be a real homeboy to save yo' life
I shoulda took Dr. Dre's advice

I know who killed Pac, nigga
The police know who killed Pac, nigga
Suge Knight know who killed Pac, nigga
He died at the car wash, the world heard the shots, nigga
Then they killed Biggie, he just came through to visit
Rampart division, Pirus ain't had nothing to do with it
So many niggas in caskets, then turned ashes
Some get shot, some Hussein Fatal in car crashes
I think it's a conspiracy theory, Illuminati
How Pac died and two months later they killed Kadafi
Then they killed Buntry Al and Heron, they getting sloppy
LAPD, these niggas worse than the Nazis
And Pac was only 25, thuggin' as a youngin'
Sitting shotgun, I wonder if he seen them shots coming
Guess it don't matter, all the niggas buried, though
Wouldn't have never happened if Suge kept it real with Harry-O

[Interlude: Harry-O]
""The way I look at it is like this, even me man, coming up in that game, right. I came up in that game, man, and I was blind to a lot of things. And even though I came to jail for some bullshit, I believe that the karma had a lot to do with that. See that's what happened with fat boy when he disrespected me in the game. But I was a good dude in a lot of ways to a lot of people and so a lot of people that crossed me in different ways think they gon' have karma. So karma swings for me both ways, what you put out you get back. You put out good shit, you gon' get good shit; it may not always look like it because sometimes there be obstacles in the between. But I done learned 'cause when I was on the street I used to go hard in the paint about different shit. What I learned over the years though is, man, sometimes you ain't gotta be the judge, the jury or the situation 'cause karma gonna handle it’s business 'cause it’s [fair]""

Late night down sunset, likin' the sin
On a tour bus in St. Paul, riding to win
Don't know how it begin, every day was a new
When he was young, living life fast and rhyming his truth
And if crack had took a part of the homies family tree
The lil' nigga he was talking 'bout was probably me
And him to know my life story and we not even meet
When we did, it was like we'd known each other for dealing
When the last time I seen him? He was playing his tape
That he would later title Makaveli the Great
Smile for me, yeah, it's strictly for my niggas
Try to touch money, high on weed and liquor
Hoping God'll forgive us, we been stuck here in the Matrix
Dead before you dishonor a nigga when he face him

But fuck it 'cause that was you
Damn we got some beautiful kids
But you never say it somethin' we did
I guess your baby daddy you
Regardless of the shit we go through
I got Jason in the booth, 2 AM singin' shit about you

[Hook: Jason Derulo]
Every time I decide to leave you all in the past
Baby I be, thinking 'bout you on the long drive, yeah
And you ain't no one to make me feel unsatisfied, no, uh
But baby you, you got me going, uh
But you got me going, you got me going, uh
But you got me, you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me, yeah

Blood is money and I spent it on ya
Ain't it funny how it ended, oh yeah?
You said you'd go down for the last time
But we both know it's not the last but I saved mine, uh
Long as you going down
I'ma tell you what you want to hear, uh
Well you got me, you got me, you got me
You got me, you got me, yeah, oh
I'ma tell you baby, you got me, you got me, you got me

Yo you can keep asking them fucking questions all fucking day man, I told you that, I told you the fuck happened, man
Told your partner the same thing, man
How long a nigga gotta stay here? Raggedy-ass precinct

[Verse 1]
It was money on the table with the bricks
I was in the livin' room fillin' on this bitch
Heard my car alarm going off on my 6
So my dogs start barkin' and some niggas hit the fence
So I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
Pulled the blinds down and took one hit of the Indo'
Them niggas ain't doing shit, but stealin' my neighbors rims so
Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
That's what I'm rollin' with...
Nah, I ain't seen shit and I ain't snitchin' on nobody
Yeah, that's my four-five, but it ain't got no bodies
Them two dead niggas? Them is nobody
They should have torched 'em, then you wouldn't had no bodies
I mean look at these pictures, shit is so sloppy
Couldn't have been me, I do my shit like John Gotti
Feed a nigga to the sharks after dark

[Verse 2]
Man, fuck this shit, I thought I told y'all
It was money on the table by the bricks
I was at the kitchen table choppin' up some shit
Listenin' to Jeezy and I heard a little (*bullet sound*)
So I turned the radio down and cocked my four-fif'
Oh shit... Am I hit? Nah, just a hole in my Jordan fit
So I turn down all the lights and cocked my four-fifth
Seen some niggas jump in they Escalade and that was it
How much longer I gotta stay in this mothafucka?
Let me get a cigarette, I don't even smoke
But shit, y'all got a nigga stressed
I gotta stay in this mothafucka 'til I confess?
Shit, y'all bitches better get some rest
'Cause it'll be a cold day in Miami
'Fore I snitch on myself or the 'hood, you understand me?
Yeah, I fuck with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
Niggas runnin' 'round the 'hood singin' they should get a Grammy
And you two motherfuckas should get an Oscar
With this good-cop-bad-cop shit, take me to process
'Cause I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
I watched First 48 so fuck your 25 years
No evidence, no bid, I don't know who split them niggas' wigs
[Verse: 3]
Already told y'all, it was money on the table with the bricks
I was walkin' to the bathroom to take a shit
Then I heard my dogs barkin', and some noise by the fence
So I ran to my room and reached for the four-fifth
Then I seen three niggas by my back door
Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer
Guess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store5Embed"

With 99 miles left, on the Avis rental car
Blowing horns like Miles Davis
At the pearly gates, God let me in
Give me a room by Aaliyah's with ESPN
I know I got more sins than two lesbians
Been back and forth across the border like Mexicans
But (I'm running) like New York pedestrians
Trying not to scuff my Nike Air checks again
It's funny how niggas be the best of friends
And fall out over pussy and wanna dead they man
One of my niggas in the grave the other one in the pen
She fucking my enemies inside my homeboy's Benz
Now she begging God's mercy 'cause she ain't listen to Nas
And never heard about Ike with the Iverson jersey
He got a cousin named Jason that rock the Gary Payton
Now the same trifling bitch is a HIV patient, true story

If I catch a murder one, nigga, I'm running
Homicide come around and they keep on coming
That's why I'm out of state and I keep on running
I ain't Nelly, but my Desert Eagle's on, girl
Just dropped bail, traveling the world
When I sign my deal I said fuck jail
I went on tour to Barcelona and Brazil

'Cause I gotta pack them shows
And Dre told me ain't no coming back from gold
So I gotta get my album in place
My G-Unit features, my Eminem sixteen, my Dr. Dre beats
And it was two years from today when I started rhyming
And took my demo to Suge and he ain't sign me
Niggas threatening my life like it's hard to find me
See me shining in the hood like twenty inch Lexanis
My mom said I'm hard head, I don't follow the rules
Why should I when Reebok giving niggas they own shoes
And I'm dealing with the same problems 50 Cent got
Yayo in jail and they think I'm trying to take his spot
I'm in the studio laughing at Chris Rock
Then I turn on MTV and see Soulja Slim shot
And niggas trying to gun me down in the rim shop
'Cause I just want the same recognition that the Crips got
They say I'm the next in line and if I get shot
Then I go out as the Bobby Fischer of hip hop
Make your chest move
Sylvia Rhone and Kevin Lyle slept cool
Jimmy Iovine was the best move

Inside a Ferrari with the D-R-E
Run up I let it sing like Nate D-O-double-G
Walk through 8 Mile, G-Unit's on my feet
Got a cherry lowrider in the N-Y-C
Eve took me to Philly, never been to the pen
Been to Uptown with 50, seen niggas in Timbs
I done seen Young Buck scuff Air Force Ones
In Cashville, but Compton is {where I'm from}
Where it's just me, my son, and my bitch
She graduated when Notorious BIG dropped ""Me & My Bitch""
She get them birds past, I put her in first class
And tell her to carry on that Dooney & Burke bag
She from Grape Street, she know how to work the mag
And only buy white tees, tell 'em to keep the purple tags
Cause the laces in my Chucks keep the beef crackin
I lay niggas out like creased khakis
In that G-wagon, lean like the 23's draggin
I got the whole N-Y-C saggin

[Hook: Nate Dogg]
If you don't know
(Aftermath, nigga witta attitude) (Game time niggas, Westside)

Y'all niggas got it fucked up
What you thought cause I'm from Compton I couldn't do numbers like Usher?
Platinum certified, nigga that's a mill' plus
Play both sides of the fence cause the Crips feel cuz
See me ridin with Nate, nigga it's still Blood
You can C-walk to this, homey it's still love
Nigga I've been bangin since Mary J did ""Real Love""
(If you don't know) I painted the Rover black
The West coast is back, I can smoke to that
Moms got the CL-6, that's a fact
I bought the house, I'm just waitin on the platinum plaques
Niggas lookin for a cat to jack
Homey I'm willin to do two life sentences back to back
So please don't push me

We did it for the West, motherfucker, like Kanye
Niggas get stretched out on La Cienega
Got three thousand stacks, I ain't talking 'bout Andre
I put it on your head, I ain't talking no toupee
See I stayed the same, ain't go weird like Lupe
Squeeze on this trigger like ain't no more toothpaste
(You ain't gon' do shit) Bitch, of course I is
You want this money, you gon' have to drive the course I did
I got that Wraith out, you talking 'bout the Porsche out here
You in the nosebleeds, come down to where the courtside is
How a nigga with a rojo rag end up in Soho
Bag, any bitch walking with a solo swag
You think you ballin' in that four do' Jag? Nah
In Tom Fords with a MK bag? nah
Give you a bird's eye view of the streets
Nigga, welcome to Compton, take you to Carson next week
Ab-Soul!
[Chorus: The Game]
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol (dollar and a dream)
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal (dollar and a dream)
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream! (Look at me now)
(Look at me now, then one day)
Started with a dollar and a dream!
(Dream, and this is what I deserve)

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Uhh, I was, fathered by the bastards
Pardon my mannerisms
The Curtiss magnet that managed without the metal with him
How the hell I did it? I let God ad lib it
I put that on Leetwood, I ain’t lying one sentence
Bitch, I started with a dollar and a dream
We went from helping old ladies with their groceries at Alpha Beta
For a  couple quarters to a baby hustling
Something major, we had to grow up sooner or later, but
I’m so Del Amo, my mama still stay off Anna Lee
Carson across my belly, I prove you lost already
Roccett my big brother, Bishop left the door crack
Game took me on my first tour, now look where we at
In the studio getting paid to reflect on that
Documenting true facts
Not to mention this the Documentary 2, too
You do the addition in ballerina shoes
Enough with the clever raps, it’s more important than that
I put my city on the map, nigga
Yeah, I really put my city on the map
I mean, when the last time you heard Carson on the track, nigga?
Let alone when they calling out stomping grounds on the West
I’ll wait...
Yeah, that’s what I thought, I’m the best, nigga
This the new West, nigga, respect that
It’s Top Dawg, all I’m missing is the red hat
But don’t question what pocket I had left, my handkerchief
I’m guilty by affiliation, in many ways gangsta
But let me explain something, a paradox if you may
I threw on my fresh Supreme Chuck Taylors today
And then I got a call from Chuck Taylor, I’m saying
The game ain’t changed, we still changing the game
Soul!

On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal (dollar and a dream)

[Verse 3: The Game]
My first album was a set up. I was the little nigga
Pac was talking to when he said ""keep your head up""
'Cause he knew what I would be facing after his demise
Jayceon had to pitch them pies, better life than flipping fries
I'm the one the Crips despise, move the Yay or kiss the sky
For having dreams that 50 died, Eulogy by Mary Blige
Hopped up in that enterprise, had to stop a genocide
Went from underdog to watching Top Dawg and Kendrick rise
Now tell me can I testify, pull over trying to rest for 5
On a block, no tint on the Wraith left these kids mesmerized
They ask me how I did it, how I got it, say I'm king you looking brolic
I put them weights down start practicing lyrical exercise
Tell me who the next to die, probably who the next in line
They got me battling ghost 'cause I'm the illest one alive
That's word to Pac, Pun, Biggie, why I stand as my city
If we was 'bout to run a train, you couldn't fuck with me
Ever since I saved my coast, it's been born again
If I ain't shit then who the king of California then?
Who could out-rap me?
Now think about if the same nigga you bout to say can run up and out-strap me
Yeah, out-trap me, yeah, out-gat me
I mean think about it, exactly
Speaking matter-of-factly I'm down playing that actually
Call me Game I ain't one still I get paid like an athlete
Do the math after the math, Doc two in the bag
Lived up to expectations, Dre took me first in the draft
Now who the fuck want what
Nobody survives so look alive when them Impalas in the cut
[Chorus: Game]
Started with a dollar and a dream and a pistol (dollar and a dream)
On the corner rag hangin', slangin' crystal (dollar and a dream)
I said you gangbanging let me see credentials
And when I pull this gun out you know how this go
Started with a dollar and a dream! (Look at me now)

Lamborghini outside but, nigga, that won't change shit
Same nigga that gave you classic after classic
Could still chop rock and zip it, plastic after plastic
Why you think Dr. Dre don't take me on them yachts with 'em?
Whisperin' to Snoop, ""This nigga probably got a Glock with 'em,"" facts
Smoke comin' out the ‘Rari hood

Motivation for all my niggas that's watchin'
All my niggas from Watts and South Central and Compton

Young niggas stay woke, old niggas stay woke

Probably die up in these streets but I survive through my name
Every nigga 'round me killers and I doubt it'd change
If the police get behind us, we go out with a bang

But, fuck a dream if it's not gon' pay
You feel me?

I ain't goin' back to jail, nigga that's what I flush for
My money or my Glock, who do I trust more?
I don't know, it's probably the one that I touch more

And my Rolex racist cause it hate niggas

Money like Dwight Howard, next time he a free agent
I'm tryin' to make enough money so I could feed Asia
Have Asians in the kitchen cookin' in Louis V. aprons
Word to Martha Stewart, if I could park a Buick
Then I could flip a Brink's truck, I got the heart to do it
Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
Speak no Ingles but dinero I talk it fluent

[Hook]
Dead president, big paper (""for the money"")
Benjamins, skyscrapers, my niggas get (""money"")
My bitches get (""money"") like the strippers get
From the block to the club I'll make it rain (""money"")
In California niggas die (""for the money"")
From the South to New York, them bullets fly for the (""money"")
Don't stop gettin' (""money"") It don't matter where you from

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Tie on a bandana, then we lay him out
Fighting over two colors in the crayon box
It's no love, It's no love
40 ounces in my cup, I'm po'd up
We out here killin' each other, but so what?
Keep it up and there's gon' be no Crips and no Bloods
Nigga take a look around, the crack game has slowed up
The government versus the people, now tell me
Who rules the world with only one desire?
I don't believe there's anything higher
Rather get it now than to read about the outcome
I'd rather have the crown, than a ribbon or medallion
And oh my days, I guess it's okay
If I lay up in the shade when my rent is in the mattress
But be at the course if I have to use patience
I'm shootin' a premature dream in the napkin
Battlin' the evils in the flesh that I'm wrapped in
Waiting for my eagle, but the seagulls are distractin'

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
What's happenin', niggas?
What's happenin'?
What's happenin'?
What's happenin'?
What's happenin'? Yeah
[Verse 2: The Game]
What's happenin'? My nigga just died from AIDS
What's happenin'? ISIS throwin' grenades
What's happenin'? White boys shootin' up a church
What's happenin'? My nigga 2-2 just got some work
What's happenin'? You can get it if you got it, nigga
But I ain't got it, nigga, I'm just a solid nigga
Who run Compton, fuck bitches and flick Impala switches
Even if I was born blind, you niggas couldn't stop my vision
Right on time with mine thanks to them old Doc prescriptions
West side flourishin' again, this what 2Pac envisioned
Obama freeing lifers, that was locked in prison
El Chapo said he ran the world, and they forgot to listen
Not me, nigga, one split second, I say ""Fuck rap""
And if I ran into El Chapo, he had work as one his captains
And gave me 100 bricks and said ""'Migo, get it brackin'""
I walk into a Mexican Mafia meeting like

[Bridge: Anderson .Paak]
What's happenin'? Pac's gone, Brenda's still got a baby
What's happenin'? Lost ones in the land of the crazy
What's happenin'? You can have a bad bitch in a Mercedes
But that don't make your basic ass Beyoncé or Jay-Z
What's happenin'? Obama 'bout to move out the White House
What's happenin'? Couple 'hood niggas 'bout to roll them dice out
What's happenin'? Is you gon' let me use your EBT card? (yeah)
I wonder if I could slide it for commissary, yah
[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one runnin' again
(You know I bust my thang for you)
You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you
Plannin' your whole life under concrete in the soil
Just a continuation, I wonder where you get your game from
If I know anythin', it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man
It's a chess game full of kings and pawns
Black and white squares, just depends what side you on
(What side is you on? What you want?
What you want? What you want?)
I want a red '64 Impala with them things on it

[Verse 3: The Game]
It's a black out inside an abandoned crack house
Only thing from last night was dead bodies and glass pipes
That was the age 4, and by the age 10
They opened up the caged doors and let the fuckin' beasts out
Fuck my auntie couch, I'm 'bout to take the street route
And get my shit the gangsta way, 'cause I can't be no Steve Stoute
I'm too Nas for these niggas, I got a surprise for these niggas
Potato cookin' on the barrel, I bring the fries to these niggas
Funeral hall, casket fit to the size of you niggas
Chrome 45, no lie, come say goodbye to you niggas
Sway got all the answers, Kanye lied to you niggas
I don't even wanna be in no top 5 with you niggas
I break ties with you niggas, then pay tithes for you niggas
Los Angeles king, I will no fly zone you niggas
Take a caravan and Impalas and drive to you niggas
Close one and aim, Fetty Wap's eye to you niggas

Ain't it a shame?
Another lost one runnin' again

You do the same old thing that your brothers did before you

If I know anythin' it's that my old head taught me all alone
And it's a cold game, better get your coat, get your snow chains, man

Impala Off-White, ski mask all black
Adidas tracksuit, drawstrings, chokin' the MAC
Got a couple bullets in it, gangstas slide in the rented
Dumpin' out the window, fuck the world and everything in it
I'm a west side nigga, ego trippin' and walkin'
Feds listenin' so we talkin' in codes to keep 'em off us
Draco, tote it, 36 shots
Don Julio got me loaded, don't think I'm not
Go mob on niggas, mob figures, mob triggers
Don't get your punk ass killed on Instagram Live, nigga
My niggas rob niggas, bury you alive
Let the bullets live inside niggas, ain't nowhere to hide
It's survival of the fittest, boy, you fuckin' with the realest
Glock nine, blue steel, holster wrap the chinchilla

Born in trenches with the crack, swallow dope, shit the sack
If you frontin' it, come back, if I front, you bring it back
Turn a bird to a Benz, park a Benz by the trap
Let 'em raid, we gon' flush, if you snitchin', you get touched
Tell my mama I'm on the run, not givin' a fuck
Who want what? I put a team together, smash out
Set you up, send a bitch over with her ass out
In California, we got them pictures niggas map out
In California, we turn a mansion to a stash house
I fuck around and leave a dub and they O.D. tonight
You in good hands, you know the Bloods gon' treat you right
Ain't tryna be your man, no, I don't trust 'em, I just beat it right
Gotta put her in a Uber just so I could sleep at night
Never stop bangin', nigga, you know it's still Cedar, right?

Too high, can’t come down
Losing my head, spinning round and round
Round and round, round and round

[Verse 1: Game]
Back to the Hooves
Ridin' down 74th and Hoover with my nigga ScHoolboy
Cadillac and a coupe
See them niggas hatin' from afar, can’t catch 'em now
But they getting smacked when we do
Rat-a-tat like we Snoop, Crown on the Vic
Crown on my wrist, crown on my bitch
And a couple crowns on my crew
Couple pounds of the blue, ivy in it
Tsunami in it when I be in it
Got the lobby in it, Tommy in it
The trunk got a body in it
Niggas be like, ""He bodying it""
Ziploc full of J’s, closet full of J’s
Workin' on my Pippen, he’s Scotty in it
Bath tub big enough to fit a Audi in it
8 gold chains like a Saudi in it
Murder with the ink, I’m Gotti in it
Don’t get too pop, get your ass 2Pac'd
Cargos with the 12 gauge shotty in it
Plus I still got a crib on Brazil
I ain’t never hardly there but I got a Maserati in it
That’s my new addition, no Bobby in it
Chop shops in the hood, no karate in it
So much money, got a money tree
Whoop so many niggas’ ass, shit we Money Team
Same fuck niggas with they hand out, same sad song
Bring the bands out, nigga should be workin on they money scheme
Back to the convers', kill 'em with one verse
Converse with the worst 'til one of our gun burst
Call the mortuary, tell him niggas in one hearse
Cause Compton ain’t like the city of Commerce
No back talk, back wall, end up in asphalt
Niggas got them choppas like we flyin' a black hawk
Put you with the roots, thinkin' a nigga was Black Thought
Now hold that thought
Motherfuckers wanna act loco
Hit 'em with numerous shots from the 4-4

Everything on life and I’d die for it
Made a mil', you ain’t even know it
Tell Illuminati I’m down for it
Call Jigga, I'm next nigga
Son niggas my new litter
Fuck the world on Earth Day
Her booty clap on my birthday
I would take the cake but I’ve been paid
I’m a real nigga, you’s arcade
Had a switchblade in the 5th grade
Smoked plenty weed on my mama’s couch
Now I’m going big, I can buy the house
You sound water down, I sound off a ounce
See this for those who say ""Where you from?""
And for those hoes who go' make me cum
But them fuck niggas we don’t fuck with them
And fuck niggas gon' lose a lung
Knock knock nigga, come feel the drum
If the bread low, I'ma stack the crumb
Hide the contraband in-between my gum
Before smoking dope, I was selling coke
Well rocked up to a 8 year old
When it popped up, call it pot luck
500 G’s, nigga pretty please
Condos where it’s sun and trees
10 tees with my 80s
Hoover hats like the Star of David
Pull on, shots a must, get me faded
Ran up on 'em, I ain't good with aimin'
Move out the set but the set I’m banging

Motherfuck friends, tinted windows on the Benz
Doing doughnuts in the bitch got me trippin like a bucket

10 hut, bring the squadron with me
See niggas talk ballin like they been in the gym
But you lookin like a novice to me now quit talkin to me
Can I vent?

Killin these niggas, I’m a general nigga
Turn yo head to a target for free
Now I’m on, look at me
Started (what?) started with them pistols and palm trees
Now when niggas come through the wood
Niggas gotta know that that’s all me
See the set catch rec
When I slide through throwin up all Bs
And niggas wanna act like they thuggin like us
We said, ""Boy, please""
This S to the K to the E to the Mmm nigga
New Rolls go vroom nigga

Got enough loot to fill up a room nigga
And I’m rolling these blunts at 100 a go
Gave her that dick now she beggin' for more
Made me a milli, yo bitch load is illie
But I ain’t got, still got 100 to go
And I do it, I does it, I spit it, you love it

Nigga done been everywhere
Left trails in my city everywhere
But nowhere like home, C-O-M-P-T-O-N on
Bitch come and dust my throne
Stand from my grandmother’s porch to my executive Porsche
Now I’m driving through London and Rome
With a Parisian bitch, rockin corn rows
Backseat of my Panamera watchin' pornos
Where we goin? What we doin?
Fly to Johannesburg, leave the city in ruins
Then fly to Dubai on my poolside, coolin'
My Audemar ain't waterproof, fuck it, go and get a new one
I done been everywhere around the world and that’s cool
But can't no hotel fuckin' reserve us parked through
My hood, gorillas move whenever sharks move
Move back to Compton, shit, we ought to
Condos on Wilshire, shit I bought two
Livin' down the street where BIG got shot, I haunt you
And the very next day where Pac met his fate
It’s how we live our life, surrounded by tape

But don’t get it confused, city still got rules
Wear the wrong colors, nigga end up on the news
Lights out, like Durant in The Drew
Then I’m right back down Compton Avenue in a Buick
If you had a heart, niggas put a bullet through it
And it took a coma for you to be king, would you do it?
Would you do it?
If I dropped you off at Watts, would you walk through it?
Would you be from Grape Street or would you Piru it?

Key to the city, they should honor us

Get greedy with the clip, no aim on it

Burn like the bridge and yo business, uh

Now I rep the floor until the ending, uh
Smoking on L's cause I’m winnin', uh
Wax getting blowed just to kindle it, uh

Second floor of my hotel, I'm rollin' up, 'bout to blaze
And zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze
As I daze about the past, and them days in the past
He set my mind free, so my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a King, I do the math
Coincidentally on your birthdays, I ditched the class
Cause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school, in front of the bus
Not even thinkin' 'bout how Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars and she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us
Sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face
(Ohhhh)
Cause sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face

[Chorus: Sample]
Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all
[Verse 2: Nas]
Uhh, word up, Game
Standin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'
I've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'
To the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them
Them sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks
Should never be allowed at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta
So people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther, the martyr, the trooper, hate killed him
Nobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'
As a kid I ain't relate really
I would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your words awoke in me
First I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed
I was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strength you had to have to march
You was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart
We miss you
Feel like King be in me sometimes

[Chorus: Sample]
Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all
[Verse 3: The Game]
The word ""nigga"" is nothin' like ""nigga""
Don't sound shit alike, like Game, like Jigga
One came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga
One is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture
The rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches
Make 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today, would Bill Gates march?
I know Obama would but would Hilary take part?
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Cause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call
That the future just took a fuckin' head shot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped
Would he give me the answer? Probably not

[Chorus: Sample]
Way up high, saw it all
A whole new world outside this bubble
A whole new world outside this bubble
Way up high, I will fly
I will hover the world
Saw it all
I will hover the world
Saw it all11Embed"

Angel, angel
Angel, angel

[Verse 1: Common]
I spent my day so, first I pray yo
Then I lay low, looking for the halo
Or more yayo, my little angel
Reminded me to stay playful
Faithful walks I take in the woods, thinking what's good
Things that I can change I should
Things I can't, need to be understood
Th-this is the bliss, I used to drift from the hood
For a second at least, I'm resurrecting the peace
Pipes that Indians used to light, we called it Chief, right?
Stepping on the leafs right to reach heights
Th-th-th-that I never seen, it's so so evergreen
Some use it for medicine, or to write better things
I was in Amsterdam man, bike pedalling
To the nature spot to taste the flavors they got
My eyes drop, I like it a lot
Yeah, my angel

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)
[Verse 2: The Game]
Th-th-the way that I rhyme blow nigga's mind
Like the first time you heard Mary J. and you were standing in line
To purchase tickets to see her blow like Chicago wind
And I'm ridin with Common looking for Chicago Zen
And like Chicago winds, I was once a Street Disciple
Rockin every Jordan shoe, Nike put out by Michael
That made me feel like I could fly, sometimes I wanted to die
Prolly cause the angel dust was fuckin with my third eye
So I started hip-hop and I understand why Common used to love her
She got me open so I even had to fuck her
But I used the rubber, cause she was married to Rakim
So I bought me a gold chain, pretendin' that I was him
So I can get close to the girl I loved the most
But she left Cali and went on tour with Ne-Yo and Ghost
Big gave her one more chance and she took Big down
I should've knew when Shock G and Pac told me she get around
An angel

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)
[Verse 3: The Game]
Fly away, fly away
My love for her is not about jewelry and cars
I love her cause she love me, just for who I are
Who I is, who I am, resembles the rims on the Lam'
I shine like Shyne when Barrington Levy was sayin
""Didilly whoooa!"", I got love for the streets
Peace to New York and every hood in the East
Before I was duckin' cops, gunshots
I used to be an L.A. Dodger, now I'm a (angel)
From the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold
Between the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome
Your hood not alone, they knockin, we not at home
And when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam
Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones
The ones they put wires on, they got us on tap
But I put wires on, my Bentley in fact
I spit it through the wires on a Kanye track

[Hook]
I wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings
Because I'm riding with my (angel)
Going through the city of the Chi
Makes me feel like I'm in the city of (angels)
Ohh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (angel)
She takes me high, she will always be my (angel)
[Outro: Common]
Yeah, it's The Game and Common
Spread your wings, follow your dreams
Things will be so serene
L.A. and the Chi is a team
Yeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on
Yeah, it's for the world boy
We do it forever, yeah5Embed"

[Verse 1: The Game]
I'm from the home of the malt liquor, talk slicker
Where guns spark quicker, on fraud niggas
Them niggas better walk with you, take the long way home
My finger itchin' and this barrel so loooong
Like Pinocchio's nose my list of foes grows
Casket closed, air tight like Mystikal's cornrows
Expose rap niggas, take hoes from rap niggas
Never said shit when they seen me, get your toe tag nigga
The Compton lyricist, you niggas can't get with this
Used to tap Dre on the shoulder like, ""Nigga come hear this shit""
He thinkin' he slick and shit, nigga sweeter than licorice
Los Angeles god, we mob like Infamous
Ain't from Queensbridge or Brooklyn but we done shook ones
Bullets, I done took some, crack, I done cook some
Don't you stand there and look dumb
Ain't no honor amongst thieves, especially when the hook come lives, I done took some

[Hook: Sha Sha]
When I look around I hear something tell me
That I’m the type of nigga you could be down for
And I be hearing niggas say they gon’ kill me
And be the type of niggas I think I should make a move on
But I came to let you know I keep that heat for real
[Verse 2: The Game]
I kicks in doors when your rap bars is Iggy
I pull up floors and take them charges with me
Aventador as I explore the city
Phillipe's with my henchmen, nigga, word to Jimmy
You could be swimmin’ in the Hudson, it’s nothin’
Think I’m bluffin’? Guns cocked, say somethin’
Ain’t too many real niggas in this here rap shit
The industry soft when Plies getting slammed and shit
I feel like Mayweather in May weather
Whoop the white nigga ass, it might pay better
Got my Timbs on the gas in this grey sweater
Tag Coogi, I bet you’d be more cautious if you knew me
Your girl tryna do me, hoochie, groupie
She tryna catch up on a Gucci, baby, no, I’m out like Karrueche
Gave me that BJ so I slid in that Pizookie
And that’s why I’m the dookie
You fuck me, I’m fucking your bitch, stupid

Niggas think they the coldest but nigga you just the oldest

Yo, 'Ye, this nigga didn't even want to put you on
Them he turned around, put on Sean
But forgot to tell him Beni Han-Han don't sell no fuckin' wontons
I don't wear Sean John, but fuck with that Cîroc shit
2Pac back, well, hit 'em up with some Pac shit
(Who run the world?) Jayceon
Yeah, with Kelly Rowland, come and be my motivation
If you invented swag, then I invented gangsta
Got one in the chamber; the throne is now in danger
And I don't wear no Gucci Gucci Fendi Fendi Prada
I'm Charles Louboutin, you niggas ain't saying nada
Lil white bitch, better stay in your place
You call me a nigga, I'ma put the K in your face
This a stick up bitch

Here go courtside seats, you are now watching the greatest
Shades blocking the haters, stays rocking the latest
The show goes on 'til I start aiming the lasers
And Lupe'll soufflé half you motherfuckers
This the Drew League, I don't wanna speak about The Rucker
Cause Jennifer Lopez just got a divorce
And I already got her up in the Porsche
Tryna teach you how to love
How to love
Marc Anthony too short (Bitch!) look how that nigga look
Man, I'm 6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot
Crooks and castles, all my niggas crooks with castles

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party
Sitting up in Marvin's Room, blowing that Marley
You wanna hit it

Don't run up on me, try to take it from me, boom
I ain't Morris Chestnut, I ain't Ricky
But I'll give you 9 shots, you can call it 50

Working on that Detox, blowing on that sticky
Can I hit it in the morning? Bet it be a quickie
Gotta hustle hard, Ace, Tunechi and Ricky
Waves Frank Ocean, you could see my odd future
You gonna need more than Novocain after I shoot you
Yesterday I went to Coachella, not to see Jigga
I went to see Wiz, but there's Amber: perfect
I took a seat on the red futon
Hit it with that Wiz shit on, whatever
So put that pussy on my face
And let me taste a little taste
I'ma eat it up like it's my last

And what time you get home anyway?

And that's what the fuck you sleeping on the couch for

And the next bitch ain't nothing but a house call

And nothing can compare to the temper that you hear
When you get caught in a stare at the next derriere
Now she's explaining to you
That she's the baddest bitch that ever graced a pair of shoes
And if you wanna gamble to find better, you lose
And all this loud chirping that you consider rude
But when food is on the table
We may be arguing like we Cain and we Abel
Then we have some makeup love and we get back stable
Have a little girl, I cut the cord from her navel

Where niggas get smoked over their Jordans and their Pippens
Welcome to California, nah, it ain't cold as New York
But life is a bitch out here: word to Too Short
Wack as a shooter so we called him Tony Kukoc
Gang banging had us addicted like it was Newports
Whoever thought that it would spread like petroleum
Now BP connect got us praying to them holy men
Just had a daughter, almost named her Katrina
If I raise her right, then maybe she can take over FEMA
Spike Lee in New Orleans shooting documentaries
And Game's still in Cali, eatin' off The Documentary
Take em to the symmetry I mean the cemetery
Where everybody boxed in: Refrigerator Perry

And every little fuck up, they blame it on Barack

So what's going on with you faggots?
And what you gonna do when your swagger no longer matters?
And your bitch ain't the baddest cause she in her mid-40s
And your Phantom played out so you hating on the shorties
Cause they running around like they was your age, when you was your age
Fucking bitches raw cause now the world ain't got no AIDS
Yeah, 2050 on these niggas
Golddiggers sucked you dry left hickeys on you niggas
I used to run around like you, run the town like you
Walk my red nose and clown like you
But it got old like Betty White
This rap shit real deep like Barry White
Reminiscing on the days I used to carry white
Walking though them Crip hoods in the Cherry Nikes
Now I live a married life, walking in the house, to them home-cooked meals
Joint American Express accounts and less dollar bills

But just like Luda, I was born in the Trap

But like Soulja Boy, I was born in the Trap
Broke ass niggas still begging for a stack
Take 'em to Shawty Lo, nigga, learn how to Trap

Shit deeper than The Roots band
15s drumming, Questlove in the coupe fam
Ridin' through Pittsburgh, Wiz got the Steelers
Born by the jungle so I came with gorillas
Since niggas dropping more dimes than we fuckin'
We out the hood, tryna get money like P touching
Splitting backwoods just to get our weed stuffed in
The crack we cookin, we don't need ovens
We need something to put in the mouth of our kids
Instead of copping chains, lets fly to Chile and dig
Go to Haiti and feed, to the Bahamas and breathe
On the way back, scoop my nigga Shyne from Belize, you know
Sometimes I feel like this rap shit is heaven sent
Then I get a high, feel like it's irrelevant
So I'm about to pop the trunk like an elephant

'Sup, nigga, huh?
You know what this shit is?
Stay down and come up (Damn right)
Street niggas is street niggas alike
It ain't even one way, nigga (Two of America's most)
Stay down till you come up, nigga, uh
Four songs, nigga (Blood Money, let's go!)

[Hook: Jeezy]
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he left and came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I left and came back in that black on black

[Verse 1: Game]
Nigga come through for a nine and a half
I'm a tell him ain't nothin' left
Nigga need an eight, tell him everythin' straight
All they gotta do is wait, tell a nigga I'm a chef
How you think a nigga went and got that Wraith?
Could've went to jail but I bought that case
Lawyer came through, told him it's about time
Jim Carrey to the Rollie, I just switch that switch
Put ten karats on my daughter ear, fuck it
She deserved every rock I done sold out in public
Do anythin' for my Destiny's Child
She a Beyoncé, never be LeToya Luckett
Black on black, checkerboard Louis luggage
On a PJ feelin' like Warren Buffett
With the Minnesota Twins, ain't no Kirby Puckett
Lift the shade, see the clouds, tell Aaliyah that I love her
Back and forth in a Lear
My grandmother say I never see her
She want me come home on Thanksgivin'
Put on some black on black like here
Black on black to my dear
Black on black in my ear
Black Maserati that I gave to my mama
Right hand to the father, she can't even find the gears
[Hook: Jeezy]
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he left and came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I never came back in that black on black

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Shit get real, we don't fold up
This is what I told myself in my grandma's kitchen
At the table, nigga, choppin' my blow up
Said she want to sell more like my father
Same time, had me for a couple dollars
Yeah, I'm 'bout to pull an all nighter
I'm 'bout to kill these niggas so you might not see me 'til tomorrow
Just like that, then my palms start itchin'
Suede hit the block, then my bong gone missin'
See, I'm 'bout to take me a trip to the other side of town
And I'm goin' there to find me a chicken
Yeah, I got a nigga in the spot with a nine right now
So, I'm goin' there to sell him a pigeon
My pastor told me that the money is the root of all evil
I said if it is, then I losin' my religion
[Bridge: Jeezy]
If I had to be precise, tell you two things about life
Niggas win everyday, niggas fail every night
I say, ""Now Oprah got a billion dollars and you're nowhere near her""
Type of shit I tell myself while starin' in the mirror

[Hook: Jeezy]
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he left and came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I never came back in that black on black

[Verse 3: Kevin Gates]
Mayonnaise jar, straight drop, no whippin'
Electric's off, everything's spoilin' in the fridge
I ain't bathed in a week, house smellin' like pickles
Street showin' no pity, still gettin' to the business
Safety pin the zip break it down sell nickels
Had to ball him out of jail, blew the money on the bail
Went flat, bounced back from a 30-cent flipper
I don't even know a nigga livin' how I'm livin'
I don't even know how many times I've been to prison
Shit get gangsta, we call Hot Beezle
Bought two things at the third, I wanna appease you
Two-fifty-two on the scale, that's a nina
Eighteen zaps, five hundred-four grams
Add an extra gram when you weigh it with the bag
Real trap talk, keep it real, don't believe you
When you get out of line, swear to God, I'm a leave you
Dicks cut the water 'fore they kick a nigga door
Tried to flush it down the toilet but the dope just float
(Wooh!) Tear gas from the cannon
Everybody scramblin', but I ain't never panic
Double homicide, broad day, that's my jacket
Try to bird feed, cut throat, I'mma jack you
And I take change, I'm a serve when they askin'
Come from out of town, I'mma tax, no relaxin'
[Hook: Jeezy]
Everythin' wrong, this can't be right
Winning so much, this can't be life (Yeah)
Shit get real, man, you can't hold back
(Stay on back, nigga, you gotta do what you gotta do)
If he left and came back in that black on black
I still do it for them niggas with them bricks on bricks
I still do it for them niggas with them nicks on nicks
Let me tell you how a real nigga supposed to bounce back
See I never came back in that black on black

Stay with me, please, don't leave me, baby
I love you, stay with me, please, baby
Someone's coming, please, please

[Chorus: will.i.am]
It seems like everywhere I go, everybody’s in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the

[Verse 1: Nas]
It be jam-packed in front of the stoops in Siberia
Same way they are in the middle of Nigeria
Every part of the whole world, there's an area
That, if you're poor, another day alive is a miracle
The blocks in Watts got crooked cops that frame the innocent
No different from Flint, Michigan
Living in the D, checking in with the pimps and them
It's similar to O-Town, in the Southern Peninsula
Pretty city, skyscrapers will fool you, look through to
Inner cities the rich won't move to
The nice parts, they well-protected by a vanguard
The opposite of how these concentration camps are
Low-income housing, it dwells murderers
But children don’t qualify for health services
The bourgeois act like they don’t see starvations
Like they spraying Estée Lauder on sanitation
[Chorus: will.i.am]
It seems like everywhere I go, everybody’s in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the

[Verse 2: The Game]
Streetlights come on, cop cars' lights flicker
They smoke us like cigarettes, need a light, nigga?
Used to chastise or string us up to spite niggas
War to fight for the culture, instead we eaten by vultures
They mix us like mimosas, hang us on wanted posters
Ask for license and registration with they gun out the holster
Some of us guilty, some of us not, some of us filthy rich
Others just watch us niggas drive up the block
We think we keeping it one hundred coming back to the hood
They think we flossin' money, so they pull a ratchet: what's good?
It happens in Compton, happens in Queens, happened to Big L
Happened to Chinx and 2Pac in that passenger's seat
Sometimes it's internal, happens to you before you happen to blink
What's beef? Cops killing niggas dead in the streets
So before we look outside, we gotta look within
Cause, now, we the dinosaurs, I think the world 'bout to end

[Chorus: will.i.am]
It seems like everywhere I go, everybody’s in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto
The, the, the, the
[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm from the project buildings, high stories
My stories from violence to glory
Dog-eat-dog world, gory
In the gutter, brother despise brother
Throwing threats at each other
Broken bottles and bar fights with box cutters
Alcoholics, narcotics, organized
Families sleep from a gas stove, burned alive
They bagging up drugs with plastic gloves
On his way to the top with his cash, he shrugs
Kidnappers, degenerate thieves and gamblers
Stealing, panhandlers, wrapping grams up
Rubber bands on they Grams, what?
Playing cards and they bored
Members of gangs, living by and dying by the sword
Block parties, food stamp, debit cards
Your hood ain't no different from ours
We share the same dreams, same money
Same clothes and cars, instead we get the same jail bars

[Bridge: Nas (will.i.am)]
The world's a ghetto, the world's a ghetto
The world's a ghetto (Ghetto)
The world's a ghetto
[Verse 4: The Game]
Me and God's son, jumping out of project buildings in black parachutes
Both classic, both ride through the hood in a pair of coupes
Flow sick, mix the Henny with the Theraflu
He told me I was ill at that Houston's, nigga, where was you?
Hip-hop critics, sit the fuck down, get a chair or two
I ain't tryna kick knowledge, just a pair of graphic parables
Grew up, spent the whole middle school in the same pair of shoes
Me and my brother sharing shoes, my childhood was terrible
That's why I spend nights on the rooftop, smoking medical
You got a minute, my nigga? Let me break down the variables
Adapted to my surroundings, flow better than I used to
Momma, this for us buyers, for the days I wore FUBU
Having beaucoup dreams, deuce-deuce in jeans, my nigga
Now, I'ma end your career in two sixteens, my niggas
If he the God's son, then I must be the prophet
And all this ""King of L.A."" shit, you niggas need to stop it
(The ghetto)

[Chorus: will.i.am]
It seems like everywhere I go, everybody’s in a struggle
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
Oh, the whole world is a ghetto
The ghetto, the ghetto, the ghetto

[Outro: Anderson .Paak]
Uh, it's a ghetto
Uh, it's a ghetto
It's a ghetto
(You gonna take that top note or what, man?
We gonna do this harmony or we gonna do it right
This motherfucker Chuck gonna come here swinging
He's gonna come here drunk off that shit
Come on, now, let's get it right, tighten up, nigga
Hey, one, two, three, four)
It's a ghetto, it's a ghetto
It's a ghetto, it's a ghetto
One more time
It's a ghetto, yeah
It's a ghetto, it's a ghetto
Hey, it's a ghetto
(Alright, alright, alright, that sound good
But we need to work on this other one, now
Let's get it tight
Come on, Lyrica, JC, Pharaoh
Let's make this shit happen man, come on)

Oh, oh, oh, took your love away

[Hook: will.i.am]
I'm cooling in LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA

[Verse 1: The Game]
Pull up to the Rosco's
Only guy here, 'cause niggas from here
Know you gotta swerve around the potholes
Eating chickens with these chickens, politicin'
We gon' get a new team or not?
They up and down like Impala switches
All these girls got extensions, even with the long hair
Everybody tripping, we mix Cîroc with Patrón here
Don't walk around alone here, everybody from a gang
Niggas ask you where you from
That mean you gotta run that chain
Smoking on that purple rain
We only smoke a certain strain
Soon as you call twice nigga
Welcome to the circle maine
Catch me off of Rodeo, Alameda, Figueroa
Whoop these rappers ass, they all bums nigga, skid row
And I ain't dissing homeless people, I be down there feeding niggas
100 days, 100 nights, we killing for no reason nigga
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Impala
[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm
And the stars ain't only in the sky
Because the stars lay on the floor
And I-I-I-I-I, I got the city on lock if you wanna explore
And baby I been cooling in LA
La-la-la-la-la-la
Baby when you coming to LA?
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
I'm from that big blue raggin', tip toe taggin'
Mustard and mayonnaise, with Daynas on the wagon
Brown paper baggin', baby mama naggin'
You're either skinny jeans, Gucci belt or straight saggin'
Pleasure and agony, black James Cagney
The wood is the wood, but the hood is like a cavity
So much tragedy, rarely see clarity
I'm like a heir-to-be, charity, sincerely
Los Angeles, scandalous, handle us how?
We the ones you get your swag from, write that down
Home of the green leaf, watch out now
High school lesson, y'all can drop out now
California highway, California my way
I do it that way, then roll a fat J
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my Cadillac car
[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]
In LA
The place where stars are born
And it ain't never cold outside
Because the rain will never storm

And baby I been cooling in LA

Baby when you coming to LA?

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
I got LA poppin', cars be hoppin'
No refreshing these hoes, they keep shoppin'
Sunset droppin', chicken heads flockin'
No recess, my flows, there's no stoppin'
DeLorean rollin', pockets stay swollen
Drive down the 10, East Los is where I'm goin'
Cholo swagger, que pasa wassup?
I'm rockin it in LA
LA native, LA Raider, LA Rams, motherfuck them traitors
LA Clippers, LA Lakers, trippin' off Kobe, you the motherfuckin' greatest
LA Dodgers, finger to the Padres
East Los niggas sayin' chinga tu madre
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, look at me in my fancy car

(Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton, Compton)
[Verse 4: The Game]
It's time to blackout, time to spit this crack out
Niggas been fiending for this shit, Aftermath a crack house
The way I spit, niggas'll think I pulled the MAC out
I said the way I spit, niggas'll think I blew J-Lo back out
Still Compton nigga, fuck y'all thought I went on vacation?
Same nigga that used to break in houses and steal PlayStations
I hate waiting
I told Dre to put out Detox, or I'ma do it
This is that nigga, The Chronic mixed with embalming fluid
Bring your chin here blood, so I can put this llama to it
Disrespectful nigga, see this window? I send your mama through it
Do it for the coast, so we can toast to it
Who showed you all the Pirus, the SA's and how the Los do it?
Similar to how the vice lords and folks do it
You remember Bump J, out west? I'm the closest to it
Put on for my city bitch 'cause I'm supposed to do it
Straight Outta Compton, I'm the fucking movie poster to it, nigga

Man it's easy to see you're special to me
Whether we lovers or friends, we'll always be
I want you to know, you're special

[Verse 1: The Game]
L-A-X to J-F-K, that's where it all happened
Caught you walkin out that Gucci store in Manhattan
I was in chains and cuffs, you was wit'cha girls
I was in that Aftermath chain, you was in pearls
It was me against the world baby girl; you had dreams of stardom
The Prince of Compton meets the Queen of Harlem
First date at Mr. Chao's it was kosher, I wore culture
The fur, the Gucci, Louis, Fendi, Prada, Dolce
You're runnin circles in my living room, tearin up sofas
McLaren or Rover, fuck it ma let's tear up the highway
Let the Sprewells spin 'til the plates fall off
Then we can go one-on-one in Dre's house
Jeans painted with the waist cut out, you rock 'em the fly way
That lil' bit of Compton mixed with Bed-Stuy way
And girl, I'm not tryin to excite you, I'm tryin to wife you
Bamboo earring, white Air Nike you, yeah

I like your style, like the way you move, the way you talk
The way you smile, the way you swingin them hips when you walk
The way you look, the way you ride when you workin them thighs
The way you lickin your lips when you look in my eyes
You down for me? I'm down for you
You go down on me, I'll go down on you
I wanna do all the things that your man won't do
I'm from the hood, so I know how to handle you
Keep you in pink rocks and G-Unit canvas shoes
Show you how to gangsta lean when the Lambo move
I'll take you to New York City, Atlanta too
Show you how to fly them birds and them hammers through
And you know

Let me tell you 'bout the birds and bees
How I stand on the block all day and flip birds and ki's
Your boyfriend don't like me, cause he don't get a fourth of my cheese
And you can take back the Porsche and his keys
Hop in the Range Rover, you ain't gotta force him to leave
I got a chrome four-four in my jeans
You got Gucci frames coverin the mark on your face
Cause he don't want you to leave, and I don't want you to stay
Sometimes I wanna snatch that nigga out his CLK
I know he treatin you the way K-Ci did Mary J
I wanna, ease your pain, kick off your Louis sandals
Let me, wipe your tears with my G-Unit bandana
You make me wanna peel you out them jeans when you rockin them
It's ""Me & My Girlfriend"" like 2Pac and them
Jay-Z and Beyonce, or Bobby and Whitney
We the 0-5 Bonnie and Clyde, feel me?
