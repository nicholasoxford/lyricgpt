[Verse 1]
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend, so
On the radio, that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know, like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone, got no patience, 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl, why is you lying? Girl, why you Mufasa?
Yeah, mi casa su casa, got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes, now the flow is so lava
Yeah, we spit that saliva, iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra, or we let bygones be bygones
""My God, you pay for your friends?"" I'll take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies, why I feel so the opposite?
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit, is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet (Woah)
Sorry, I'm just scared of the future
'Til 3005, I got your back, we can do this, hol' up

[Verse 2]
I used to care what people thought, but now I care more
I mean, nobody out here's got it figured out
So, therefore, I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it
So insecure, no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame, we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine, or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone, whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs
Got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go
Emily, Fam, and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk, at least I think so
Can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear, they're not here
'Cause they don't care
It's kinda sad, but I'm laughing, whatever happens
Assassins, I'm stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping, I'm glad that it happened, I mean it
Between us, I think there's something special
And if I lose my mental, just hold my hand
Even if you don't understand, hol' up
[Chorus]
No matter what you say or what you do (No, no)
When I'm alone, I'd rather be with you (You and me)

I got more tail than that PetCo (What?)
You faker than some Sweet'N Low (Why?)

But really, are you eating though? (Yeah)
Are you eating though? Nigga, are you eating though?

Never catching cases, why they faces look so E-M-O?
Watch a hater hate me, wanna play me like a piano

Your girl, she jockin' these (Yeah?)
No hands like soccer teams and y'all fuck boys like Socrates

Ain't nobody—

Okay, it's Childish Gambino, homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ
Move white girls like there's coke up my asscrack
Move black girls 'cause, man, fuck it, I'll do either
I love pussy, I love bitches, dude, I should be runnin’ PETA
In Adidas, with some short shorts, B-O-O all over me
My green is where it's supposed to be, your green is in my grocery
This Asian dude, I stole his girl, and now he got that Kogi beef
My dick is like an accent mark, it's all about the over E's
Hot like a parked car
I sound weird like ""nigga"" with a hard 'R'
Fly like the logo on my cousin's 440
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies, whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands, lookin' for Earl like Toejam
I made the beat retarded, so I'm callin' it a slow jam
Butcher and I know it, man, kill beef, go ham
These rappers are afraid of him
'Cause I'm a beast, bitch, ""grrr"", Invader Zim
Gambino is a call girl, fuck you, pay me
Brand new whip for these niggas like slavery
Told me I was awful and that shit did not faze me
Tell me how I suck again, my memory is hazy
“You're my favorite rapper now”, yeah, dude, I better be
Or you can fuckin, kiss my ass, Human Centipede
You wanna see my girl? I ain't that dumb
You wanna see my girl? Check Maxim

Fuck that, got goons like an archvillain
I'm from the South, ain't got no accent, don't know why
So this rap is child's play, I do my name like Princess Di
Yeah, they say they want the realness, rap about my real life
Told me I should just quit, ""First of all, you talk white
Second off, you talk like you haven't given up yet""
Rap's stepfather, yeah, you hate me but you will respect
I put in work, ask Ludwig
Put my soul on the track like shoes did
Played this for my cousin, now he can't even think straight
Black and white music? Now, nigga, that's a mixtape
Shoutout to my blerds, they represent the realness
Shoutout to Gambino Girls, my dick is in the building
I know you hate me 'cause your little cousin play me out
I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin' ""Ow""
I'm sorry for who followed me
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah, I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table, don't bother me
I don't talk soft, that's that other guy
I'm screamin' ""What the fuck is up?"" like I ain't seen the sky
The shit I'm doin' this year? Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it, Casey Anthony

I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over, when it's all over
No settling down, my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling, you start crying
I come over, I'm inside you
I can't find you, the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
Text say that ""It's not fair""
That's code for ""He's not here""
And I'ma flirt with this new girl
And I'ma call if it don't work
So we fuck 'til we come to conclusions

I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go 100
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time, but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome, good problems?
Right? Wrong
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers, but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through

Power 106!
LA, it's ya girl, Yesi Ortiz
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think
It's Lloyd, called ""Oakland"", on Power 106
[Verse 1: Lloyd]
I was making Japanese and she's watching DVDs
In Oakland, in Oakland
Now I'm driving up the 5 and she waits 'til I arrive
In Oakland, in Oakland
Everything that I wanted
Only gotta drive for the moment
If you tell me, ""Turn around,"" then I'm on it
For the moment, but you know me
You know how I get when I'm lonely
And I think about you and the moments
But everything you do is so Oakland, so Oakland

[Chorus 1: Lloyd & Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
Before I get to The Bay, babe, that's a problem
Because I'm way too scared to call
And you might get me to stay, and oh
[Post-Chorus: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
I don't really mind the drive
But I think I'd rather die in Oakland, in Oakland
With my hands on two and ten
So I guess it all depends on Oakland, on Oakland
And I'm nervous, truth be told
I never saw me growing old in Oakland, in Oakland
And if I married you tonight
It would probably start a riot in Oakland, in Oakland

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Everything, that I needed
Now that I got you in your feelings
Everything you won't say, you tweet it
And a nigga don’t like that shit at all
So treated
Can we just roll with the feeling?
Can we just roll for a minute?
Wait a minute

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
Foot on the gas, I'm just trying to pass
All the red lights and the stop signs
I'm ready to go
But I'm really not ready, girl, that's a problem
'Cause I'm way too scared to fall
And I know you choose to stay, and oh
[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
All the girlfriends saying, ""Here we go again""
Rich kid, but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
X-O the O face on your exes, right?
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me, I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me, weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July, house in Kauai, yeah, we can try
So let's try

[Outro: Childish Gambino & Lloyd]
Whoa
I took off my nine-to-five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me, just hit me
And if I left you all alone, would you still pick up the phone?
It's iffy, you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon in Oakland, in Oakland
The only one I know is you
So the fuck I'm supposed to do in Oakland? In Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland
In Oakland, in Oakland

Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac, two Charlie Murphys, and Akon
The girls that you brought, man, where are they from?
Where are they from? We were playing PlayStation

But, afterwards, it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up

I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
""What is he wearing? Somebody jack that fool's steeze""
If I'm a faggot, spell it right, I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazing, I'm a phenom
I'm assassin, I'ma kill y'all
I'ma say ma-ma-sa, ma-ma-ma, coo-sa
And this shit's closed now cause I ball too hard
And I'm cumming on her face, have I gone too far?
I don't know, who cares, I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these fake niggas always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out
They tryin', nigga
Realest motherfucker in the game like Tron, nigga
Forget these white girls
I need some variation
Especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend? Roll solo
Can I stay at your place? No hobo
Not my fault, man, these ladies love me

Can we try something new and not be suspect?
I don’t really know, we fucked up bad
You don’t wanna see my dudes when they get mad

Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor, no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos

How old are you?
Saying that you never date older dudes
Why I never wanna say no to you

Nevertheless, I got that fresh like it was Crest
Grind 'cause I'm stressed
TMJ or TMI, it's a lie that you're living
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same-sex marriage
Same sex everyday, monotonous
Lost God, never pray, forgotten us
Lost love, never say it just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walkin' in it
With a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said, ""If you gon' miss Heaven, why do it by two inches?""
Old money and new bitches

Trolling, trolling, trolling these niggas
Rickrolling these niggas
They mad 'cause they don't know any better
""Hold up, it's the kid—quick, tell him he can't sit with us!""
Fuck it, got money, bought friends like I'm TBS
VVS, I can see it all with the clarity
Real deep, hope they dig a nigga 'fore they bury me
Even though we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow, that's that dial-up, watch it pile up, fly

[Chorus]
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
Andrew Auernheimer
Pulling on her weave, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
[Verse 2]
We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask like a lucha—
Door open, we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway, the manager pissed as hell
I mean, where's the line between Donny-G and Gambino?
He hang with girls like he Lena, but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina, thirty dollars I swallowed
The Sauza so malo (I nuzzled my Nyla)
And then she said, ""You need to grow up
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago, sing me a different song""
Whether you're trolling or controlling, just a reminder
You think you get it, you don't, it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone—now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell, just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden, this burden hurting, they said there was curtains
Certain demise, look in his eyes, the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and had a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love, saying, ""Go hard""
Making dope, it's a trap; Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams, so it seems we're meant to die
I had to figure it out; ""It's the best,"" no, that's a lie
Had to get some stuff off my chest, I vaporized
High on my own, it took time to realize
Because the Internet, mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey, at least we're together
Man, I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make him believe in himself, people who needed my help
Feelings I felt, killing myself, no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information, retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation, your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication, but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met, doors left open
(Who is this? Don't do it, where are you?
Who is this? Who is this?) I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game, but he move with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever, my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make her dance, my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence, first-person shooter
First person to move, first person to speak
My mils aren't meek, they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference, these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny, the day you born, that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner, we conversatin'
She beautiful in the face, but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit, becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening, she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith, she getting hers
Niggas take her props, like a musical, live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time, I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams, on the moon, I visit her
Every night I text her, ""I wanna solve the world, I think I need your help""
She text me, ""How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself?""
I mean she right though, .45 like a lightbulb
And I could've died like my iPhone, but I kept going like a psycho
And I took Chance like a dice roll, dropping jewels like it's puberty
Wrote a note on the glass: ""You see what these labels do to me?""
Text said, ""I'm wet""; I said, ""Hold up, wait a minute""
H2O plus my D, that's my hood, I'm living in it
Never forget this feeling, never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit, fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit, but act like it don't stink
We were childish, but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit, eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies, I'm afraid to go nuts
""Life: The Biggest Troll"", but the joke is on us
Yeah, the joke's you showed up
[Outro]
You're here now
You have to help me
You have to help me
I need you—you have to help me
You have to help me

All these haters, see you later
All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
So CG, but a nigga stay real though
I'm fly, I'm ill, I'm runnin' shit
3-points, field goal
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian, bail
Yeah, they starin' at me jealous 'cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help like an old gold digger
Uncool, but lyrically I'm a stone-cold killer
So it's 400 blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah, now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it, too busy, they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man, you ain't been there, nigga you been scared
And I'm still livin' single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn’t white enough to use your pool when I was eight
Stone Mountain, you raised me well
I’m stared at by Confederates, but hard as hell
Tight jeans, penny loafers, but I still drink a fo' dime
Staying on my me shit, but hated on by both sides
I’m just a kid who blowin' up with my father’s name
And every black ""You're not black enough""
Is a white ""you're all the same""
Mm Food like Rapp Snitch Knishes
'Cause it's Oreos, Twinkies, coconuts, delicious
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room?
I said, ""I want a full house""
They said, ""You got it, dude""

[Verse 2]
Holla, holla, holla, holla at your boy
Like your dad when he's pissed off
Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk
Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk
People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen? Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters
So, my studio be a funeral
Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?
Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den
Man I'm Hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage wit' my family in front of me
I am what I am: everything I wanna be

I know you know I know you got that power

[Spoken Word Outro]
This is on a bus back from camp
I'm thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn't met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pine needles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don’t know if you do or don't more-than-like me
You've never said, so I haven't been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who's smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don't go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won't go to the same high school
So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And then I'm like, “Can I tell you something?”
And all of a sudden I'm telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there's no expression on it
And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time
Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
And regrettably, I end up using the word “destiny”
I don't remember in what context. Doesn't really matter
Before long I'm out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”
I don't know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus
So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long, I really am
I wake up, the bus isn't moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you're not there
Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore
We're parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad's car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row, on our way off
It's Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can't really see her face
But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn't even know you were friends with them
I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer, even though there's two weeks until school starts
This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not
I'm just saying it's what I learned
I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always
Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them
But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad? Sure. But it's a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit
But that's not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
I still haven't73Embed"

[Verse 1]
A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise, the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi, texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on the West End
He's lucky, she's a career woman, no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit, it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here, it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But, I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh, on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster, bitch
Yo, but not in the lame way
Like, you ain't livin' out in BK
Like, you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like, your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like, she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie, but she different

Fuck you

We can pretend if you want to, like
We in love and started dating at your art school
'Cause either way we both lying more than half of the time
Except for when I’m home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other, I'm taking you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
Yellow-911-Persian girl-in-the-back car
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch, I love Rugrats
Watching lames handle they fame, they bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Analling anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding, stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow, she still look good though
Love is Eastside, who are you to hate?
Movie ass; not a 10, but a super 8
You ain't see me at the show? I was super great

""I had a dream
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people, so many pretty faces
I talked to some birds, I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going, and going, and going
And even when you laughed, you cried
And even when you were sad, you were really happy
'Cause you were here, and I got to meet every star
Every planet, everything that made me
And we all kissed, and became the same
We became the same, we became the same.""

Who would have thought this? We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness, it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition, keep 'em off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been

Why try at all? Why bother?

It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know

Why try at all? Dark calling
So we're left alone, no one left to call upon
Be still my broken bones, as I travel on

To make me try and forget that there was something wrong

We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man, I can't tell her
The fear that I feel, man, it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killer
With the drums and the groove, so it feel Dilla

Alright it's Childish baby, Mr. Talk-About-His-Dick-Again
Nerdy-ass black kid, whatever, man, I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token, who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred, use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm, dude, show respect
Something crazy and Asian, Virginia Tech
She too fine, I do dimes
If not that, I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops, it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts, I'm double suspect
Ballin' since '83, half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem, I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids, not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
Like, ""What is this nigga doin? Rap is for real blacks
I hate that fucking faggot, man, he think that we feel that""
Or ""I wrote on rape culture my junior year at Brown
So I'm allowed to say what all his raps are about""
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's? Nigga

Runnin this thang, money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
What, what's my name?
In the woods, got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man, fuck a backpacker

[Verse 2]
Niggas with OCD, N-W-O
All white like my clothes, CW shows
Nigga got signed, it's an anomaly
No cosign: trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
""Man, fuck you nigga...fuck you nigga!""
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit, turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon, bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans, baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM, she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
""Super Bass,"" super face inside a garage
It's not a massage, spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame, these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that, boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back, how the fuck a nigga say that?
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback, comin' on that mace took

Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick

[VISUAL]
You can't live your life on a bus...
EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY
A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber
All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end

A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy

       CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is

He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo

The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off
The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours

       FATHER: How was camp?

The Boy ""shrugs""

       FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?

       THE BOY: No

The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh

       FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight

       THE BOY: Frito pie

       FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-

       THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie

Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window

EXT. MANSION - DAY
The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic
INT. MANSION - DAY
An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care

The Father's phone rings:

       FATHER: Hello

       PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-

Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off

The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice

The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics
He starts checking his mail. His friend ""FAM"" sent him something that says ""this is you"" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video

He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as ""VERY HOTTTTTTT"". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying

""This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! [CRYING EMOJI]"" is the top comment
The Boy stares. Then types ""fuck u niggers"" in the comments

He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart

He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with ""Fuck U"", ""You wouldn't say that to my face faggot"", and ""LMFAO crackers b crazy""

The Boy smiles...bec a use the in t e  rnet15 YEARS LATER*******[PLAY SONG ""CRAWL"" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

The room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer

There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has ""hackz"" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk

There's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz ""Demon Days"" poster, and a ""Black Dynamite"" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors ""You Are My Starship"" is the album on top of the others

Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right

The Boy (more a man now) is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen
INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on (you're not supposed to do that). He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate
EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING
The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background
The boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:

       FAM: when u wanna paddle out? [PURPLE DEVIL FACE EMOJI]

       The Boy texts back: pick me up

CUT TO:

EXT. MANSION FRONT DRIVEWAY - MORNING
An old, red (a gross red. a weak red) Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop. FAM, steps out of the car. Daps up

       FAM: Let's take one of yours

       THE BOY: Nah

       FAM: Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my car

       THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous

       FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?

""...why do you even care?""

       THE BOY: Aight

INT. GARAGE - MORNING

The garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles

       FAM (pointing to the car no one's ever seen): That one-
       THE BOY: No
       THE BOY: The Bimmer

We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head

       FAM: Nah...nah

They get in the 911

CUT TO:

EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY

The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk

       SOMEONE FROM A WINDOW: I work nights, dickhead!

       FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?

Fam honks more
The Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name ""You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar"" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights
He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
...someone tweeted ""roscoe's wetsuit""

""...what's that?""

The Boy drops ""roscoe's wetsuit"" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to ""what is roscoe's wetsuit?"" is...""roscoe's wetsuit"". Hilarious

SWANK, STEVE, MARCUS (Chance the Rapper), and AJ (STEFAN) walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911

       SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to get these in there?

       FAM: You guys take your car

       STEVE: What about your boards? Where are they?

       FAM: Can we borrow some?

They all make a face

       SWANK: We need a bigger car then. I'ma drive to your house and get the Tahoe

       THE BOY: Come on, guys. This is taking forever

       AJ: Where we going?

       FAM: Dockweiler

       MARCUS: I swam into a diaper last time

       FAM: I'm GRIMEY. I ONLY SWIM IN DIRTY WATERS! YOU KNOW THIS!

       SOMEONE AGAIN: Shut the fuck up!

Fam honks the horn

       SWANK: I'm drivin that Porsche the way back. I know that shit

Swank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street

       THE BOY: What's ""roscoe's wetsuit"" mean?

       FAM: I don't know

They drive off

EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY

The guys carry the boards through the sand to ocean, making a strange pattern behind them

They setup camp and start changing on the beach

       MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls

       THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early

       MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?

       THE BOY: I asked every girl

       FAM: You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house

       STEVE: Why white girls?

       MARCUS: Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-

At that moment, they all notice a girl sitting on her board in the ocean. Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black

       MARCUS (CONT'D to AJ): See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me

A plane flies low overhead. (Dockweiler is right next to LAX)

       MARCUS (CONT'D) (staring at the plane)
It's gonna crush me

       SWANK (re: girl): It's like seeing a mermaid

       STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee

       MARCUS (R. Kelly): I'ma flirt

Marcus runs to the water with his board. They all follow

EXT. OCEAN - MORNING

Marcus swims up to the girl on his board

       MARCUS: Sup

       GIRL: Hi

       MARCUS: I'm Marcus
       SASHA: Sasha
       MARCUS: It's lookin alright today
       SASHA (Australian accent): Yeah. It's the only reason I'm out here
       MARCUS: Oh, you're Australian (pause) You ever seen ""Kangaroo Jack""?
       SASHA (not looking at him): Yeah
       MARCUS: Classic
       SASHA: ...wha?
       MARCUS (not mean...just serious): It's a fucking classic

Silence. Sasha is weirded out. All the guys, except The Boy, swim up

       STEVE (to Sasha. Out of breath): Hi. Did Marcus ruin it already?
       SASHA: Yes
Steve splashes Marcus
Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth

       SWANK: How long you been surfing?
       SASHA: Ten years. You?
       SWANK: Bouta month
AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?

He passes it. She takes a hit

       SWANK: What you doin tonight?
       SASHA: My friend's birthday in Santa Monica
       MARCUS: Yo, we're right around close. We're having a party tonight in a mansion. You should come. And if your friend's a girl or a guy who has weed, they should come too
       AJ: I'm Djing. I start off with Jodeci, then the switch over to 90's rap using ""Dream Lover"" to transition, play ACTUAL ATLANTA TRAP for an hour, hour and a half. Then motown, soul, and house. Girls. Go. Crazy
       SASHA: What's your DJ name?
       AJ: Twercules. no ""DJ"". Just Twercules. I got a tumblr where I post my mixes. It's getting pretty popular. I don't know. You sing? Model? Act?
       SASHA: I'ma go in

Sasha starts paddling and catches a wave into the beach

       AJ: I shouldn't have said ""bitches""
       MARCUS (thinks): ...you didn't

AJ thinks on this. This is probably saying more about him than he realizes

EXT. BEACH - MORNING
Sasha carries her board onto the beach. The Boy is sitting there

       SASHA: You goin in?
       THE BOY: Don't know yet
       SASHA: Then why'd you put on your wetsuit?

...roscoe's wetsuit


       THE BOY: Everyone else was
       SASHA: That's an awful reason

She starts walking

       THE BOY: You should come to the party. It'll be fun. (then) They invited you, right?
       SASHA: Where is it?
       THE BOY: [EDIT]. Text me [EDIT]
       SASHA: I'll remember. I'll bring some friends

She walks off

Later that day:

*******[PLAY SONG ""WORLDSTAR"" AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. I-10 - EVENING
The guys drive down the highway eating In-N-Out. Head nods all around. Swank is now driving the Porsche. Crazily. Fam is with The Boy and the rest of the guys in the other car. Marcus drops his animal style fries on the floor

       MARCUS: Fuck
       FAM: You see you fuckin up this car?
       THE BOY: It's fine
       FAM: He's driving crazy. (iphone goes off) And he's textin me

The text says: R E C K L E S S

       FAM (CONT'D): This nigga's so lame

The Boy sees a tweet of the lead singer of a boy band tweet ""follow your heart and [HEART EMOJI] all who cross your path!"". The Boy retweets it with a [LAUGHING/CRYING EMOJI]

       FAM (CONT'D): I gotta stop somewhere first

CUT TO:

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

[VISUAL]

Fam pulls outside of a club. Lots of people are trying to get in. He and The Boy get out and walk to the bouncer, their friend CHEESE. Fam and Cheese dap. The Boy stands on the side next to a line of people trying get in VIP. They look at each other. He is not dressed appropriately to get in

Fam and Cheese do that handshake thing they do. Fam walks in

Some guys in a black SUV rolls by and yell at the dude next to The Boy

       MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you out here Jay! Don't let me catch you!

The Boy watches this for a second. He looks down for a moment...

Someone has spray painted ""roscoe's wetsuit"" on the sidewalk. He stares at it

       MAN IN CAR (CONT'D): I got yours, muthafucka!

The Boy snaps out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts recording the fight. Fam walks out and sees the fight in action

       JAY (I GUESS?): You scared, bitch! That's why you scared!
       MAN IN CAR: I got something for yo ho-ass my nigga!

POP. POP

..what's happening?

Jay is bleeding from his stomach. The Boy is seeing this through his phone. It takes a moment for him to realize-
POP. POP
...run. now
Fam is already running. Everyone in the line is screaming and running. The Boy runs

       COP: Drop your weapon!

(these are cleaner and succinct) POP.POP.POP

Runs to the side of the building. The SUV that was firing slows down. The driver is dead. Car horn blares as the car slows to a stop, mixing with girls crying and ""oh shit!"" and ""fuck"". Jay is very close to dead. The blood on the sidewalk is almost black. A street sign (No parking between 7-9am and 4-7pm) is reflected in the dark blood. He turns to The Boy, looks around. He knows what's happening. He's leaving

That was the end. He'll never read this sentence. Or any sentence. He ended earlier. Before this sentence. As far as he knows, before any sentence. He's back to his/the natural state

The Boy felt something

It's funny, cause this dude is dead. There really isn't a connection...it's more him seeing himself for the first time since-

       SOME NIGGA: Damnnnnn.....!

       HIS FRIEND: WORLDSTAR!
The Boy's phone rings:

       THE BOY: Yeah
       FAM: Get in the car

The Boy turns and sees the car rolling up to the alley he's hiding in. The Boy runs up and jumps in. They speed off

INT. CAR - NIGHT
       FAM: That shit was NUTS!
       STEVE: I knew something was about to happen. I knew it
       MARCUS: Donnie Darko. I'm tellin you

The Boy is looking at the footage on his phone. He's got a death on video. It's looped. Over and over

The Boy touches his shearling coat...there's a hole in it. Bullet hole? He puts his finger through...

...i shouldn't be (here)

He looks at Fam and Steve. They're talking

       MARCUS (CONT'D): Bitches high heels everywhere! They ran out they shoes, cuh

       FAM: BAP! BAP! BAP! Oooow. That nigga lit up

The Boy just keeps watching the video

       FAM: Yo. You got it on video?

       THE BOY: Yeah

       FAM: Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope. (then) We gotta pic up Doc from the jazz club

INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT

Fam and The Boy Stand in the back. Doc is on stage playing saxophone with a band. He's doing a solo

       THE BOY: Does it weird you out that you almost died today?

       FAM: Not really. I'm not trippin on death

       THE BOY: I'm not trippin. I'm just sayin, if you think about it, there's no reason for us to be here

       FAM: Doc be hanging with the weirdest people. Look at these niggas. They all look like James Blake. Is that who likes Jazz now?

       THE BOY: I was thinking about it and I can't offer anyone anything. Like, my job is tweeting at people. That's my job

       FAM: That's not your job. You do it cause it's funny. You're rich. We don't have to do anything

       THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?

       FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?

       THE BOY: All we did was print shirts for ourselves. Who else is buying that shit? And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope

       FAM: I don't know what to tell you. We are doing dope shit. We are making moves. We can do whatever we want-

       THE BOY: But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once

       FAM: Then don't make a shirt, my nigga

       JAMES BLAKEY LOOKING DUDE: Shhh!

The Boy fiddles with the hole in his jacket

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

All the guys walk in with plastic bags from the grocery store. They have blue cups, alcohol, s'more fixings, and gummy bears

If I was the director, I'd have everyone walk in in slow motion into the house with ""Nosetalgia"" by Pusha T playing

Walking into bedrooms. Opening drawers. Pulling out bags of weed

CUT TO:

AJ walks into his large closet. Pulls out a bowl. There are some prescription bottles there too

CUT TO:

A naked Marcus steps out of the shower and goes in his closet and pulls out some condoms
CUT TO:

Fam is meditating in the center of his bed. He's floating off the bed by about 4 inchesRAP GENIUS NOTE: This is the end of Part 1, continue on at Part 273Embed"

See now I don't wanna see an era, an era, an era
See now I just wanna live forever, and ever
Maybe it's the last night
Maybe it's the last night

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young, didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day and call for help
We were gods, nobody was above me (Woo)
That ""A"" on my chest like adultery (Yeah)
That ""A"" on my chest, put your fist up (Yeah)
That ""A"" on my chest like a chipmunk
Alvin, Theodore
Breathe in, breathe out, mi amor
Breathe in, breathe out, never mind
It was time, number nine
L-L-Lies, feline with a death wish
Eatin' right, didn't help shit
No name on the guest list
Hold on, we were destined

[Chorus: Azealia Banks & Childish Gambino]
See now I don't wanna see an era (No) An era (No) an era
See now I just wanna live forever and ever

All I don't have's the future
Take on my soul
All night

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, break free from all of the insides
The godless denied us
But we don't give a damn 'bout the next day
We were never here, never know if the world change
Common sense, the consequences
Retweet the truth, then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed, never live long
Live and die by the line, ""Never know fear""
Even I won't survive, is it unfair?
Is it unfair? 'Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress only thing that'll last (Last, last)
3005, the year that we fear only God will survive
To be alone is alive

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
He slangs his yay through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least, for sure
And they say there's no way, I should stay with someone like you
But I tell them, ""No""
There's no way I could stray, gotta stay with someone like you
'Cause I know one day you could take me away, far away
I know you could pay all the money you made
There'll be plenty of sunshine

[Refrain: Childish Gambino]
I never worry 'bout it
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)
I have my nigga count it, no, no
(Back up them O's, back up them O's, back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold
(Dressed up in gold, C3PO, C3PO)
I'm out of time, oh, no, no, no
(Act like you know, act like you know, act like you know)

Oh, we gon' have a party
All my friends will be there
We drink all the vodka
There's music everywhere
Now wait a minute (Wait a minute!)
Do you like to party?
'Cause if you don't (Oooohh-wah!)
Don't come over here
We got smoking, Blue Dream
Drinking, cocaine, fucking
I wanna show you what it is, ohh

[Verse]
Thought I was done but that wasn't the case
Got a new stack that I threw in your face
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis
Infinity pool and a statue that's Buddhist
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino
Saw I was rich, now they fucking with 'Bino
Brown leather bag, the vacation Messina
The boat in the harbor, I rule the marina
10K for the drinks, now they say I'm insane
It's been that for a minute, now Hedi Slimane
I been black, lucrative, since Danity Kane
Who came back for a minute, now everything changed
High as a kite, lime in the light
Y'all niggas might whine every night
I ain't invite all these people to my motherfuckin' house
""Get the fuck out of my house!""

What the fuck do y’all niggas really want?
I went with realness instead
But all the ""real niggas"" I know either crazy or dead
Yeah, I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude’s for real or not
I’m not trying to come hard, I’m trying to come me
That’s why these older songs that I used to make I’d release free
What’s the point of rap if you can’t be yourself, huh?
That’s why I come first like my cell phone
I’m a role model, I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it’s dumb, that’s the fucking reason I’m doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit?
Or is it real shit?
‘Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend’s baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit?
(See, that’s not even right)
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she’s sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That’s not life, dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
’Cause I ain’t Mumford, I ain’t tryin’ to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain’t the coolest but I know I got passion
I got passion!
[Hook]
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find

[Segue]
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
She said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”
I said, “Baby, I’m okay”
Said, “Why you gotta act so strange?”

[Verse 2]
Am I serious? I don’t even know
Are you hearing this? This shit is laughable
I ain’t trying, I’m doing, these other rappers are foolish
I got fame, my A&R’s a computer
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes?
Who wears short shorts and makes jokes sometimes?
My nigga like, “I’d get you MTV if I could, man
But Pitchfork only likes rappers who crazy or hood, man”
So, I guess we gon' see
I ain’t Curren$y, but if there ain’t money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up, I don't want to be here
My mom loves to text me Psalm verses
She don’t look at me like I’m the same person
I used to be the sweet one, but things change
And I don’t want them missing a son like Bon’s last name
And all my uncles alcoholics, shame on me
I drink whiskey till I’m grounded, no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no idea and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be
[Hook]
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
I really wanna do her right and it doesn’t matter
We’ve got all the shine we need to find
We need to find
We need to find60Embed"

I've been grindin' my whole life, nigga
I've been grindin' my whole life, Rosenberg
I've been grindin' my whole life, Fam
Yo, let me see, yo, uh

[Verse 1]
Stuntin' on the low so they feel better
Damn, why they hatin' on a real nigga?
East side Atlanta where they kill niggas
I was in a coma but I stayed with you
I'll be right by your side, radio play me that new 3005
Bino won't die, illest rapper alive
See what's up with Fredo when I'm out in the Chi
Murder everything I touch, but I don't know why
And he can get the business, your girlfriend love me
Turn it up, who is this? Shots at your fitted
Gra-ta-ta, are we not that fly?
Are we not young God, is this not black excellence?
I could lie to you people but my soul too sensitive
Gam-b, y'all ain't got shit on me, man I'm so fly, like XYZ
Threat to the throne, man, I'ma murder this
You are such a poser, you ain't ever heard of this
Shots at you fake boys walkin' 'round in turtlenecks
And a du-rag? Wanna be me so bad
And the hair so homeless, record labels want us
Bino well read, like Octobers
Hit me on my Snapchat, hit me on my Nextel Chirp
Run up on them boys, get murked
Nigga sit down, he can't stand me
Curly black hair, bright pink panties
Blush on the vanity, tanner with her ass out
We don't have to love each other, she just wanna cash out
Stone Mountain bitch, run it off a mixtape
This is for my niggas up in Onyx getting shitfaced
He just dropped a mixtape, she got so excited
Took her to a Clippers game and niggas ain't invited
Drugs on the rider, need to clean my act up
Man, I thought he was an actor
Thought he was a fuckin' joke, when I wrote them fuckin' notes
Everything I do is dope, I hope you niggas overdose
I hope you niggas hear the truth, so honest in my interviews
If Parker Lewis couldn't lose, I'm blackin' out at Tongue & Groove
Royalty, I run the crew, we them boys
[Interlude]
Yo, I've been grindin' my whole life, nigga
Nah I'm talkin' 'bout?
I'm just sayin' I'm grindin' my whole life, nigga
Nah know I'm talkin' 'bout?
Yo, I got some more, I got some more, yeah, yeah
Let me see, Imma try and go in, uh, uhm

[Verse 2]
Mothafuckin' right, we the niggas huffin' OG
In the club tryna keep it lowkey
She was all on my D, then we fell out of it
Cause I'm never really there and she tired of it
Real nigga shit, real love, real pain, real intimate
These niggas so scared, I'm killin' it
These niggas so scared, I'm killin' it
So serious, gave the wrong young niggas money
They gave the wrong young niggas money
Gave the wrong young niggas money
Schoolin' these niggas, got so many zeros they think I'm a dummy
Unlike these other niggas, man I'm really from Atlanta
This dark-skinned art student with light-skinned advantage
I'm ahead of my time, online messiah
Who spits so much fire that you a God damned liar
If you say he ain't hot, numbers don't lie
Niggas do though, when they say he ain't cold
Niggas need to learn code, man I'm sick with the Python
Mothafucka, I'm ill, born just to die, that's the human curse
The world in my words, spit a universe
I know they hate a nigga down in Spin Mag
Worst album, best song, how you spin that?
The best part is that they love Chance
But our fans are the same, you should fuck with your man
And I wonder what they'd say if that EP drop
""His verse was wack, his verse was hot""
I'm on my jock cause I don't need these hoes
They're all the same so I don't need these clothes
Same white shirt with his nappy ass hair
Like ""bitch do I look like I care?""
Nah, in the end they will notice that we've been God
I watched these niggas switch jerseys when your team lost
And yet it's bitch move nigga, make the show 6 figures
Then you fly to Kauai for a week off
And his girl's body lookin' like a centaur
They do what they can, I do what I want
Let's move it along, the point of this song
I think you doin' fine all the time, drop a fuckin' bomb, nigga Vietnam
On my mom with my hand to God
So my hand's on my fuckin' chest, but you didn't notice
Niggas hang around like we didn't notice
Niggas can't help me but they want a selfie
Cause their girl is a fan and they really love us?
Know behind closed doors
You fuck with the kid or you still not sure? Be a man about it
Don't talk your shit and shake hands about it
Be a man, I doubt it, I don't know

Why I'm looking so fly, I'm just being me
Moved up, weed in my girl clutch
White girls, so the twelve never really searched
Smoke cars, swear to god she need a bigger purse
Royalty, I'm the boss, we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian, wonder if she let me slide in?
The OG making noise like a firetruck
Flew in, touched down, then we light 'em up
I've been saying that the clique, there's a lot of us
They talk shit, but nobody else on top of us
Got popular, this the real shit
Get—in the face with a full clip
Get—in the aim, niggas don't slip
Then get—with a case just for sellin' it
I know them gorillas, I hang with them killers
They paint 'em as villains when really they livin', we gotta ball

I ain't write shit down, I'ma steal that crown

And I can be your spotlight (Spotlight)

You shoulda seen me last night, last night

I could've been a tragedy
That’s why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
‘Cause they ain’t have the smarts or the heart
Ain’t you read the fucking book Things Fall Apart?
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Try to tell it to your heart, Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Calling me the new Will Smith, that’s Jaden
Calling me a faggot when I’m rapping, that’s hating
I need to slow down, what the fuck is y’all saying?
Step inside the party, y’all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple: Live easy and Bruce Willis
I’m the boss, Michael Scott, y’all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire, y’all motherfuckers is chillin', what is this?
That’s why these fucking emcees want their asses back
Don’t you know that I’m a rapist? Ask a track
Whiskey sipping, wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fucking hate me, that’s what I’m used to
Suck a dick, we the shit, Metamucil

Than pill-popping all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I’m Jessie in this bitch, I’m so excited
There’s a party at the top, you ain’t invited
But it’s lame, and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breaking up’s a mistake

Not going back

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Dirty girls love my dick; they’re cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat, it’s not kosher
Relax, black chick, I think that I have offended thee
Got nothing against the sisters, I just don’t think they’re into me
I am not a thug, AKA: what they pretend to be
I am just myself, AKA: my worst enemy
Yeah, bitch, cut the swag with a fucking knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It’s cool though, it’s all good
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I’m sorry, babe, but I act me
I don’t ""act black,"" whatever that be
I’m just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah, they're looking for some In-N-Out, animal style
With this lettuce, cheese, bread—making sandwiches
That’s why you niggas fail like all of your parents’ marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones, told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
But she cute, so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man, I threw that shit away, it felt dumb
Believe me, it was bad, we’re better off, you’re welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse, crazy, right?
I guess it all goes somewhere, you know that?
Like that bullshit, you talked before Culdesac
""I didn’t know he had it in him""
Couldn’t see me as Spider-Man, but now I’m spittin’ venom
Now you payin’ attention, pick your fucking face up
When I wanna be a superhero, I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because
[Outro: Beldina Malaika, Childish Gambino]
Fake love, these fake dreams
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt
Your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you’re ready to be (be)
But it isn’t with me (me)
So I’m ready to leave you alone
I don’t really wanna fight like this
I don’t ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold onto
I just wanna be your girl
Everything you haven’t heard
Plus, I just wanna be with you

Yeah nigga, it's me again
I'm still around, I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
""Gambino Girl forever"" on that bracelet that she bought online
To dudes who couldn't take it, might I say, ""Hasta luego""
'Cause I'm takin' all your city like I'm Carmen Sandiego
I am smokin', I'm on fire
I am blazin', don't get hurt
To my white dudes, it's a concert
To my black nerds, this is church
From that NYU dorm to the Emory
Everyone hated me, I'm more hip-hop than you'll ever be
I'm bustin', bustin', bustin', I'm bustin' on these niggas, man
And nothin', nothin' nothin', n-nothin' is the same again
You lookin' dumb as hell man for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around, she busy sleepin' on him
Will he fail? Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic, I'm the talk of the nation, ha

New shit, you didn't know?
Black rock like a fuckin' LOST episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway, you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt, that's that 20/20 hindsight
My shit be Jackson, Jordan, Bolton, Keaton, Tyson, 5 Mikes
Donald Glover, no relation
Always workin', no vacation
They couldn't feel me, novocaine-tion
Murder verses, the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all, like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me, that's somethin' that's so unusual
I've seen the future, and the future go, ah

Hollering at this Japanese girl, Asian mommy
But is it too soon for Japanese girls? Too tsunami?
Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame?
Was I supposed to stay uncool? Please remind me
(What the fuck is up?) Yeah, it's Cheezy, ho
I'm so cheesy, ho, my swag's got high cholesterol
I know y'all girls, I met them all, you're her ex-man like Cannonball
I ain't got shit to say to ya, I'm known for bad behavior
Look at me, man, I went to the W from Double Tree
Makin' out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee
Can I live up to all this hype they have for me? It's hard to tell
But these girls I'm kissin' chase the blues away like Gargamel
I'm back in the game, coach put me in
T-Pain flow, all I do is win
With a glass full of Macallan to mess me up
And the cash we can throw at them unless we fuck
Dopeness, after this, I hit the highway
I'm headin' west like I'm fuckin' blowin' Kanye
Read the fuckin' news, Huey Lewis, nigga
You can't go H.A.M, you's a Jewish nigga
Donald Glover, you don't have to call me ""Childish""
Except for when I'm flirting with your half-Latino stylist
Photoshoot, beach house playin' Beach House, free wireless
So I can post these pictures on my website of her smilin'
I kissed this girl I've liked since back when I was just a sophomore
But I'm afraid to text her ""What the fuck it take so long for?!""
What the fuck has changed? Is it swagger? Is it money?
I still dress the fuckin' same and my nose is still as ugly as the day you fuckin' met me
They're tellin' me I'm the rapper for these white kids
'Cause black kids can't possibly like the same shit
I wanna bring you back to the studio, try and get your number
These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their Tumblrs
I like it when you tweet me, you smell like baby lotion
I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean
Her pussy tastes like vanilla, tasty ho
Clown niggas, then I kill 'em, Gacy flow
It's crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick
I'm Pryor in his last years: comedian who's sick
Fuck, but I am sick, seriously
I don't feel so good, 'cause I don't get sleep
And I'm always travelin', and I don't go home
And my friends don't call, 'cause I turned off my phone
I've made mistakes, I bumped my head
Inside of this girl, inside of my bed
Whatever, man, I'm just havin' fun
I'm sorry that I fucked her, but now you know that she's not the one
I'm doin' you a favor, like every time I rhyme
Or write a script or do a movie, there's a million ways to shine
Choose one instead of what you're doing tonight

""You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you!""

Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off

Fuck you! I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows, cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
""Yeah, so, whatcha gonna do man?
You don't speak to the hood, man""
If I was given one chance I think I could, man
These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like, how the hell he drop a EP and meet JAY-Z?
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin', ""You could tear this up!""

Don't ever leave me, my love

Fuck the fussin' and fightin' and arguin' to this and that

I never text her back
I know it's comin' quick, wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male, because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room, I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months, ain't heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when ya chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder, you heard me?
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year, I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck, but I still like
If we were kids, I'd have the black K-swiss and Reebok

Findin' you's like findin' Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish, nah, I’m skippin' all of it
Black and white girls always come wit' a set of politics
That’s all that I was sayin', I’m a proud man
They wanna holler when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes, but she push a brown Focus
And she’s doin' coke in front of me, but act like I don’t notice
There ain't breakage in that Trojan? She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz, goes both ways
They too busy stabbin' hoes like OJ
They too busy trappin' pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is ""Do, re""
If you had told me the truth, we'd be okay

Listening to ""Sky Is the Limit"" on my Walkman

But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
And okay at them computers at the post office

You're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it
'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father, you should stick around if you could
'Cause even if you're bad at it, you could Tiger Woods or MJ

He said Atlanta wanted somethin'

Copycats making sure T.I.P. keep that crown

I went hard 'cause niggas say that I'm soft

I'm aiming a little hard, I gotta be honest

I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock

For hanging at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel's real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel

Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed, man, I'm royalty

Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you

[Verse 1]
First off, let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
So I'll probably use the B word a couple times
I used to love your fucking mouth, you had enough of mine
But what's the reason for, you never gave me any sign
When we were making out, you kind of act like it was nothing
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends
You fucked me in a different way, I guess it all depends
Texting on my day off, ""Hey babe what's going on?""
""Sorry I can't make it out"", sad face emoticon
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on
I told ya I'm a soldier need a girl scout to tag along
Face down, ass up, that's the way you left me
I thought there was a spark but we were missing Lisa Leslie
""You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me!""
I'm always fucking childish, you knew that when you met me

[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
[Verse 2]
You ain't that fine, bitch what the fuck you heard?
I love these shitty ass chicks I guess I'll never learn
I hate it when you think you really getting something good
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should
I got so many fucking girls, I can't even count 'em
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about them
Never kiss in public, but at home I am affectionate
Fucking bitches left and right, my dick is ambidextrous
I know you probably texting this lyric to your friends
Saying ""This nigga think he all that. He fucking sucked in bed"", well uhh…
I think we both know that I worked that ass
I hope your dude can keep it stretched, yoga class
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference
But you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence
So let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it

[Chorus]
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am
Nobody really wants you
Who's in love with you now?
I swear to God, I swear to God I am

We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our woe-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Verse 1]
'Bino, will you be my baby daddy? (Yup)
I'm too fresh, man, the world ain't never had me, yup
I'm too fresh, man, y'all ain't never gave me that
Stone Mountain, ain't no doubting, and these niggas won't hold me back, ah
They wasn't hating him anyway
My roommate exercise, man, he moving that heavyweight
My girl ain't down to ride, couldn't deal with my day to day
I'm at my Grandma's house, man, like I don't know what to say
Maybe ""I'm sorry"" but sorry don't pay the rent
I promise to pay you back and I don't know where he at
But tell him he missing out, his grandson cool as fuck
And tell me who be standing when them other ones giving up?
Let's keep it spontaneous, uh, I don't need that rehearsal
More flow, man, than Progressive commercials
Get with the program, 'cause the plus loan ain't putting us on
I got a month long before I take the bus home

We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Verse 2]
I know this music shit ain't shit
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it
Damn, I wasn't in it, damn, we wasn't finished
Damn, I got us tickets, damn, we went to Venice
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision
Gotta make it, 'cause if not I'm a failure, my wallet Azalea
And my brother still moving, ain't no shit I can tell him
Trying keep him out of trouble, but the cops is wilding
And it's nice to have a felon when the boys get violent
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love
Grandma's couch, my biggest fear, and fantasy
When I ain't in her arms all I'm making is enemies
Hear 'em screaming obscenities at a nigga
Wanted to live bigger
Them Edenwald projects was eatin' our concept
Of anyone walking out, what is you talking about?
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold
On the same train that my parents met on
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto
High off of pressure, man, that's a stiletto
Got your own couch now but you don't feel better
[Chorus]
Oh, eh, oh
Lost all of our woe
We lost all of our whoa-oh, sad love songs
Hey centipede, centipede, centipede...

[Intro]
I know it's your first
I will try to be gentle
My love....

[Verse 1]
Worst rapper to ever spit on an open mic
Worst rapper to ever get on so many likes
Worst rapper to ever blow up and over night
And when my D swell my D-12 friends, but Obie Trice
Young, black and gifted but he still in America
Heard the flow was gettin' better, is he sleeping with Erykah?
They passing me they demos, these rappers, I think it's funny
Cause they tryna get my demo, young white kids with money
I promise, worst rapper, iTunes most played
It's just me and both Macs, self made, self paid
Headlines saying he leaving to be a rapper
With niggas saying:
""This dummy; he eating off of his acting, I mean
Who the fuck wanna be a rapper, it's stupid, I mean
Who knew that every rapper with a new crew
Wanna do shit on Hulu,""—that's the blueprint
You drive until the lease up
I drive until it's dirty, please somebody call a Brinks truck
Yeah they know me, happy face emoji
That OG, I might OD so Avengers keep it lowkey (Ahh)
Well I'm sitting on top of the world
There's only one second secure
And I can't get it back
My life is a sham, no time to react; breathe
Find solace in the fact my ball bigger
Pause, like dog fingers
Give a fuck 'bout y'all niggas
Get the point like ball kickers
I do shit, eat good, need a toothpick
Your girl play my music
So that's thumbs down to your new shit
[Verse 2]
Buddha stance on a forest on the ayahuasca
I'm as high as copters, binoculars
Looking down on my confidence
Truly honest man, I wish there was more of us freaking out
I wet the bed the first night on my tour bus
God damn, what you doing man?
I can't name a lot of rappers that you better than
He hates women and himself, I won't give him the chance
Tear myself down first to make 'em pay in advance
Heard a lot of y'all talking behind his back
When he walking out
Me and Fam in the corner, what are they talking 'bout?
The same dudes who laughing after you go
Be the same dudes emailing asking you 'bout your show
It's on FX? Tight nigga
Me and my homies making flicks
Me and my homies making beats
Me and my homies making hits
Me and my homies hit the spot, roll with us, gold diggers
I don't really like those niggas, Childish like goldfishes
We saw this kid get shot up by the cops in Atlanta
They shot through his Phantom
And tandem cannons were blamming him
He was standing there like 20 seconds before
Now he gasping for air, bullet holes inside of his dome
What's the point? I don't know
Why am I here? Why am I alive? Why do you care?
Living real everyday, what was your undoing?
Khalifa's first name now there's urine on him (Eww)
Damn 'Bino why you gotta do it to em?
I'm Terio, I'm Terio, my cousin ""Ooooh-ahh-Ooh-ing""
New shit, new shit alert, never fake (Ugh)
There's levels to the shit like a wedding cake
[Outro]
My new girl so pretty that the world shine
My new girl getting kissed by the coastline
My new girl so pretty we can bovine
Worst rapper ever, how I'm giving out a cosign?
Chance The Rapper, yeah that nigga crazy

I used to walk on the beach at night
I remember
The best time was when well, me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night, but just enough time
Magic happened, nothing was born luckily
It's up to me, but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never, it's real
Electric eels in the water, we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I'd like to write a poem for you, leave it for you in your room Under the moon, romance

Music was my side chick, but now we’re moving in together
Always felt misunderstood, I guess I have to tolerate
My swag Jehovah Witness, dude, it never take a holiday
APC jeans, brown leather jacket on
Kitsuné cable knit, cardigan from Rag & Bone
Thick Filipino chick, homemade bracelet
Her booty make her just a rapper, she ain’t gotta say shit
I’m someone they admire
Set the game ablaze, I’m an arcade fire
Laughed at my rise like my motion was funny
Yes, ashy to classy, my lotion is money
The ride is easy when the dollar’s there to grease the wheels
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel
It seems the more I try to connect with the world
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before
I wanna pick up the phone, ask my dad how to handle it
But what will happen when my dad’s not there to answer it?
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down
Like when these niggas called me ""faggot"" and we homies now
But we are not homies, I just keep you around
‘Cause all your talkin’ is the noise I need to kill the sound
Of all these voices tellin’ me no one can help me out

""You are the bestest, I will obey you""
These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin’ other dudes
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude
Actions over words, ""girls will be girls,"" that’s all it proves
I used to be this guy sittin’ with an open heart
Now my computer screen’s the only place I feel a spark
I don’t fuck with fake bitches
Except for when I fuck with fake bitches
Canon 5D to take pictures
Of these girls who wouldn’t talk to me a year ago

Here I go again, talkin’ money, women and clothes and cars, right?
You could switch all of my words out with Plies’, right?
People sayin’ we’re the same, please, come from under me
We are just some rappers, got no luxury of subtlety
No subjects when we’re rappin’, we say it like we hear it

Read your Twitter messages, too proud to block you

They called me ""fat nose,"" my mom say, ""You handsome to me""
Mrs. Glover ma'am, your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in, but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in NY deal crack
It's weird, you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
7 dollars an hour, WIC vouchers, it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit
But all they get now is, ""Can your son read this script?""
[Hook]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows

[Verse 2]
Yeah, Dad lost his job, mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face, she still made dinner
“Donald, watch the meter so they don’t turn the lights off""
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He’s supposed to pay ‘em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my mama made us sleep with Phillips heads
Under the pillow, like that would do somethin'
But she’s got six kids, she’s gotta do somethin'
She don’t want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad cause his father ain’t around
He lookin' at me now, like
""Why you so fuckin' lucky? I had a father too
But he ain’t around, so I'ma take it out on you""
We used to say ""I love you,"" now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you’re the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over, I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you’re young and black, don't believe 'em
You're still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin', for some reason
[Hook]
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—we can follow the road
There's a world we can visit if we go outside
Outside, outside—no one knows

I just wanna play you something

Everything you love's just gonna leave you one day

Small chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud? Let me back track
I know my game ain’t that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad?
And girls want what they can’t have
So I don’t text back when the screen flash
You love me? You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck, I can be that
Crush girls now, couldn’t last year
Oh, you like me now? Well that’s weird
Last year you were chillin’ with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same?
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you, ma, Raichu
Fuck your life
I don’t really think I drank enough tonight
Looking at you, make me wanna fuck for life
Lame ass dudes gon’ suck tonight
But so are these girls, am I wrong or right?
Girl, do somethin’ to me
“Nah, baby, you way too hood for me”
Y’all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over, mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey, girl, let a python slide on
Stay sick, infect me, Lysol
I’m on the edge, they hoping that I might fall
I make it work, I’m running with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain’t used to
For me, by me, fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me, go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
See the ocean, dope shit, you an ’06, I’m an ’02
But enough about high school
I’m getting laid, or I’m getting lied to
You my stand-in Cameron, let me be your A-Rod
You number one in The Pack, Based God
Should I say something dumb to give us something to fight about?
Never mind, lights out

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose
Have them lights turned on, show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me, me

Swag
2:30 and we still making progress
Talking on Twitter, see where to go next
3:30, man, where did the time go?
I’m chilling with this Asian chick I met in Chicago
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick, man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went?
I must've left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah, we doing stupid shit, have stories when I’m older
But I don’t wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I’m chillin’ out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That’s why I wild out, keep the city up
Uh, I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talking ’bout the girls in my songs
If you don’t like it, I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here, ’cause he bunk
She like, “I’m not a slut”—speed bump
By the way, what’s your name? ‘Cause we drunk

Show me what you doing, I don’t wanna lose (we drunk)

One time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was,  had stars on it as well
So it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly, when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean, our cars came and the lights were on on them so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night
You were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I, a different color, so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure, so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours, turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was yours—it was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life, you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me
On this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight, and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed
Cause the flow cold, like a SoCo
I was smoking-smoking John Lennon—where my Yoko?
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet
Verbal mania, imma show you the illest, get my cousin to kill it
Had a flow but you steal it, I'm in the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back we could fall out
We could fall out, nigga we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a Prius, she giving me that genius
Mensa, we that Tony Danza
Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka, green so Blanka
Vape so good and the pot like lobster
Nigga, I'm a monster, fuck it, I'm a mon-star
Man, I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard
Turn them flashing lights, at least you know who you really are
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god
We are becoming god

But I can't leave you behind
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind

Goddamn, Goddamn, Goddamn
Yo it's kinda hard not to like, get fucking cheesy on this shit
But, does that even matter?
You know what I'm saying, juxtaposition man
Juxta-fucking-position
My nigga Jaden Smith dropping  jewels and niggas don't believe him cause he's Jaden Smith
But it's all about packaging right?
Real shit though, good and bad is all relative man
It really is, a lot of niggas is sheep
We don't even know what we like anymore
We just know what the most hype is
Shit, do you really like that shit you like?
Or you like the way they gave it to you?
You know what I'm saying?
Pepsi, Coca-Cola same thing
Dave Chapelle said that, the one that taste the best
Was the one that was paying him the most at the time
That's all that happens with us man
We some weak niggas man, all of us
Followers, sheeps, plural made that shit up
Apologin' ain't no real word my nigga
We know this, but he knows more cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man
Funny thing is man is like, as a futurist
And I can call myself a futurist
Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone

STEVE
That's debatable

But yo, Misla swears she's seen more vaginas than me. In real life

Listen, I am a woman. I am in locker rooms, in like gyms, whatever. I see naked women all the time. Forever, too. Not just since puberty

DONALD is sitting against a tree and holding the lemons that DANIELLE picks and hands to him

DANIELLE
I've had the most strangely reoccurring dreams over the last week. And uh, it's like of my wedding, but nothing is going right. Everything's a disaster. My guests are all there, it's all of my real life friends. They all look gorgeous. They're all like fully done up in their gowns that they're probably going to wear to the wedding, my family is there. But suddenly I realize I should've been married by now, and I'm not married, I'm not in my wedding dress. I'm all alone, in this giant area where I see my guests being served their cocktail appetizers off of paper plates. Everyone seems to be having a great time, but they're eating off of paper plates. But I am wearing cargo pants. Army cargo pants

DONALD
Like Old Navy?

DANIELLE
Yeah, exactly. Like Old Navy cargo pants. I don't own Old Navy cargo pants. I'm not even sure where that came from in my head, but I'm wearing that with a T shirt and I'm supposed to be getting married. My hair's not done, my makeup's not done. And my mom comes in and asks me, ""Why aren't you getting ready for your wedding?"" And I'm like ""Oh, I will be, I will be"" but suddenly I'm smoking a cigarette, I even don't know why I'm smoking a cigarette, but in my mind I also that I'm three or four weeks pregnant. Horrible, right? So I tell my mom, ""Mom, you don't know this, but I'm three or four weeks pregnant"" and she says not ""Put down the cigarette"", she says, ""Maybe you should get into your wedding dress"". It's all very, very weird. I'm not sure what it means at all

DONALD
I think we have too many lemons
DANIELLE
One more?

DONALD
Yeah

DANIELLE
And these two
DONALD
Yeah, some of them. That'll be enough

The legs of an unknown person balancing and walking along the edge of the pool

CUT TO:

A MONTAGE:

A group of people are dancing around speakers. Assumingly, music is playing, but the events of that scene are muted, and replaced by the dialogue of...

INT. MOVIE ROOM. - NIGHT

DONALD and FLYING LOTUS are exchanging verses they've written

FLYING LOTUS

Investing time on writing lies, slightly truth without a clue
I met my higher self, pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs
He said ""keep the mic smelly like a rotten tooth""
And all your fears forgotten when the Cap is in the booth
I'm an angel in an agony of flame
Feathers growing at the mention of my name, reinvention of my shame
I'm a slave to the darkness of my innermost cave
And all these words I hold tighter than a glowstick at a rave, nigga
Dance around the camp fire, buttnaked, blowing trees
Could give a single fuck if somebody sees, I'm free
Red ""V"" bleed out a scarlet letter, kill a king
And I'll sitting ready for whatever weather the seasons sing
Picking up expensive habits, chasing after little rabbits
Hope they lead me to a place of magic
Sad at all the times I never thought I had it
Losing all these memories, and y'all doubt it matters...
Patterns
DONALD
Mouth to a Pellegrino, bottle color of envy
Who the fuck is Gambino, I hand a waitress a benji
To act like she never met me, I'm saying though
They want the game changed when your shit on the radio
Fruit was so hanging low, I didn't even bother
She tryna land Obama's, man she get it from her mama
I don't blame her, I tame her, give her something to visualize
On my couch watching DVR'd ""American Dad""
Man those new Celine bags are so to die for
I'm in that Porsche on Prozac, them suicide doors
Watch her walk as the death becomes her
Cause Mrs. Tarantino kill bills, no wonder
My heaven is the present, so maybe this is it.
Pray to God every night to make me believe he exists
Drink a fifth of vodka, I don't need no sponsor,
Heard a preacher holler, make him hold these souls

And that's when like the hook...

FLYING LOTUS
Yeah that's tight. I like that

You know you got a little...

He points to DONALD's nose, and DONALD touches it to find blood dripping

DONALD
Oh shit

FLYING LOTUS
Yeah

DONALD gets up, and runs to the bathroom

FLYING LOTUS(CONT'D)
Wow

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DONALD examines his nose in the mirror, surprised by the bleeding
He looks for the source of all the blood, and notices and obstruction in his nasal passage- it's a string
Nauseated and scared, he pulls the long, blood soaked string while gagging and coughing. Finally, he dislodges the string and what is attached at the end, a golden tooth
He places it next to the sink and washes his hands, as the sound of the running water transitions into a similar sound of the shower water as DONALD now sits in the shower

He is still, and his back is to us

CUT TO:

EXT. POOL AREA - NIGHT

DONALD and FAM are sitting next to a bonfire, eating s'mores and swapping childhood stories

FAM
I remember being seventeen, being scared as hell. Getting prank calls, like crazy stuff. Just like senior year in high school. Had a lot of girls, it's crazy. So, this one girl, she was super crazy, she would call my phone from a blocked number, and it was her. But then I started getting like the crazy death threats. Started as a joke, then they knew exactly what kind of car I was driving, where I liked to hang out. Then they started shooting in the area, so I couldn't sleep at home anymore. Went and got a gun from my friend. Started sleeping on the street for a week. The scariest thing about it all though, is having a gun knowing you might have to use it. scarier than than killing somebody is thinking about killing somebody. Sometimes you can't explain why things happen. Those seven days, man, just couldn't handle it. Just couldn't handle it. You just get to that point like why did I get here? Sometimes they just do

DONALD
When I was like five or six, we were living in Decatur, in the projects. On Commerce Drive. It's nice now, but like we were living there and I remember my mom's friend. Like a friend of the family. This kid like... Something happened, I didn't understand it but he had to stay with us for a couple of day. I didn't really understand it. But we didn't have any space. So he had to sleep in my bed. I remember in the morning waking up and he was like ""Let's rub butts"". I was like ""okay"" like whatever I did it. And I didn't really get it. And then I turned, when we turned he kissed me

FAM
He kissed you?

DONALD
Yeah. Like you said, I don't know why it happened. I don't know why it happened

FAM
Did anybody like know about this?

DONALD
Nah, just him

FAM
That's wild

DONALD
It's crazy

FAM
Like I said, sometimes you just can't explain things

DONALD
I'm gonna go inside

FAM
Alright, I gonna stay out here, man

DONALD begins to walk inside as we...

CUT TO:

HALLWAY

DONALD is walking to his room, as the GIRL passes him in the opposite direction
He turns, quizzically

DONALD
Who are you?

She doesn't respond, or even look at him, and keeps walking. Donald continues walking to his room

CUT TO:

INT. DONALD'S ROOM. - NIGHT

He is flying face up, eyes closed. The phone rings and he opens his eyes

He leans over and picks up the phone

WOMAN (V.O.)
Hello, who's this?
DONALD immediately hangs up, looks down for a moment, and takes off his sweatshirt and shirt

He lies down and falls back asleep

I'm afraid my parents won't live long enough to see my kids
I'm afraid my show will fail
I'm scared my girl will get pregnant at not the exact time we want
I'm scared I'll never reach my potential
I'm afraid she's still in love w/ that dude
I feel like I'm letting everyone down
I'm afraid people hate who I really am
I'm afraid I hate who I really am
I'm scared people will find out what I masturbate to
I'm afraid I'm here for nothing
I feel that this will feel pretentious
I'm scared I'll never grow out of Bro Rape
I'm afraid people think I hate my race
I'm afraid people think I hate women
I hate people can say anything
I hate caring what people think
I'm afraid there's someone better for you
Or me
I'm afraid this is all an accident
I'm scared I'll be Tyrese
I'm afraid Dan Harmon hates me
I'm scared I won't know anything ever again
I'm scared I never knew anything
I'm afraid I'll regret this
I'm afraid this doesn't matter at all
I didn't leave Community to rap
I don't wanna rap
I wanted to be on my own
I've been sick this year
I've seen a bunch of people die this year
This is the first time I've felt helpless
But I'm not on that
Kept looking for something to be in with
Follow someone's blueprint. But you have to be on your own
The label doesn't want me to release in December because it's not a holiday record and I'm not a big artist. I started the record last Christmas. Christmas always made me feel lonely, but it helped me restart the new year. I want people to this album when everything's closed. When everything slows down and quiet.  So you can start over
I got really lost last year. But I can't be lonely tho. Cause we're all here
We're all stuck here
I wanted to make something that says, no matter how bad you fuck up, or mistakes you've made during the year, your life, your eternity. You're always allowed to be better. You're always allowed to grow up. If you want172Embed"

Bino, I'm so for real-o, green like I'm Cee Lo
Hangin' out with Kilo... Kish, smokin' on that Keisha
I'ma need that visa
I'm working on everything that I'm touching man
I'm bussin' two white Russians drinking themselves
But it's still ain't nothing yo
It's East side if you can't tell, North Decatur and Glendale
So fuck y'all, all y'all, if y'all don't like me, good
Put that on my partner man, I wish a nigga would
I say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood
I'm in my zone though, fucking 'round with that 4-0
Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto
Girl said that she need the follow, tweet her and she'll do any
Man, I'm trying to stay off, readin' 'em makes me angry
On the back on the tour bus, recording the two of us
Stacks at the Apple store, man this ballin' is new to us
Trying to make amends, bailing on all my friends
Niggas went to the club, sent a beat to Gucci instead
Man I'm feelin' right, my nigga Fam yellin', ""Don't stop""
And half my crew is always faded on some low top
Stopped drinking for the most part
My only vices all our pictures on my laptop
Screaming at me saying, ""I ain't what you really want""
Christina's parents baby all I make is Milians
We got the shows, we got the paper, but I want respect
So tell them haters we ain't quitting yet
Let 'em know

One love, the thing that hasn't changed
My parents lost their job, it's so cold in the A
Now that I'm one percent, I send most of it home
I want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans
And everybody saying, ""Get it while you hitting man
We want them harder beats, that 808 you slipping man""
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter
Heard a voice in the back, hate from all the fake rappers
That I shitted on, shitted on
Shitted on, shitted on
Rap your soul, dude, let the mic blaze
Show 'em A-Town, East Side, all day
I put it on, I put it on
I put it on, I put it on
Life is somethin' IMAX, film is at a climax
I ain't even started, was it stupid I departed?
Man, probably, but now we do the things we always wanted
I'm proud of me, cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with
Please somebody cum laude me
Graduated, anticipated the hatred and doubted me
Not a prodigy, just a hard worker from the Dean's List
But most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress

Oh, this is the idea where you're doing, like, one piece of artwork per track
That's dope

[Verse 1: Bun B]
Late ass nights come from long days
Doin' all the right things in the wrong ways
Doin' all the wrong shit for the right reasons
Sprinklin' midnight game, call it night seasoning
Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol
Trill O.G, mop up the floor with the best of y'all
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all
And catch a flight to Rio de Janero for la festival
Yeah, and that's word to fit a baldy
Ball hard like it's cement inside of my Spalding
And I'll break your face with a no look pass
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass
I use harsh words cause these are hard times
And trill-ass people, nowadays they're such a hard find
So it's one eye open if I could peep ‘em
And one on the scope, so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em
Man, my flow is so parabolic
The energy'll blow you over even if you're brolic
Goddamn it, now that's one for the Googlers
That fell sleep on they desk and never step their noodle up
Takin' lames out never been new to us
The hardest part of this shit is figurin' which of you to bust
Then step your weight up like GNC
And R.I.P. to Chris Luda reppin' CNC

Rest in peace to them niggas who was dead wrong
Toni Braxton to them niggas, that's a sad song
Cry a river Timberlake, the whole industry
Record the whole album in my living room in Italy
Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout
Keep your mouth shut, I can probably help your man out
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven
Kill the web, man these niggas need they hits up
Kiss her neck, add a dime to the tip cup
She is not ""slut,"" fuck a dude who says so
Just because she's fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady
Kill the whole stage, I never needed a mic check
Semen on my spacebar, fuckin' tired of Skype sex
Runnin' with a new breed, me and Bun B
This hip-hop nation, that big country
Nigga, please! We ain't stop for no one
Wu-Tang Generator name, I'm a shōgun
Wu-Tang Generator name, watch him smoke one
Talk a lot of shit, but none of them will approach him
Gambino got first position, the game is ballet
So graceful; drive, he don't need a valet
So angel: fly as I wanna be
Mercy, somebody show these niggas can't hurt me
Woah

Situations will arise, in our lives

Nah fuck that, I'm at South DeKalb Mall
Really in the parking lot, leaning on some broke niggas Camry
The pic you sent last night says you really with the shits

Wasn't ready for all that

I'mma take you to Tongue & Groove
There's $20 to wear my hat inside
I give em $100 and tell em to pay forward for the niggas behind me
They playing Jeezy like that shit came out yesterday
Thug motivation, I was never a thug and they used to respect me for it
But now the game's fucked up and I gotta Michael Corleone these niggas
Quiet, confident, I talked to her

Sick Boi is the crew, fuck these niggas with a dirty dick
When these mothafuckas gonna understand I’m serious?
I’m hard in the paint like I fuck her on her period
James Dean swag, leather jacket, white t-shirt
Rolled up sleeves, nigga lookin’ like a greaser
Word is born, baby my dictionary’s in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum man
Why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit?
Won’t be on the freshmen list, guess I’ll just keep spittin’ shit
Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades
No iced-out chain, Rod Lavers all day
I was hopin’ they would see me just for me, dope rhymer
They do me like my first house, no co-signer
See you usin’ qualifiers, you don’t even know
“I guess he good for a rapper who on a TV show”
Even though, I was rappin’ back when Lance had chemo, ho
Even flow, Pearl Jammin’ niggas can’t leave me alone
I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low
Feel me, though, DVR my thoughts and make your TiVo grow

Aladdin on you fuckers, prince of the game from street rat
Dudes fall off, too steep like tea bags
Steady movin’, don’t worry about where I’mma be
Cause I’mma be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie
Honesty, I’m rappin’ ’bout everything I go through
Everything I’m sayin’, I’m super sayin’ like Goku
Fuck nerdcore, fuck backpack
Fuck rap cool, I make cool rap
I make music for wack blacks to blast back
In fact, I swear the track I lie on’s my last track

[Hook]
Running through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound (All night, all night)
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher
Running through the moment as the sun goes down (Starlight, starlight)
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound (All night, all night)
But it’s all for you to prove it, keep on movin’, keep on usin’
My shine, my shine, my shine
Ooh, take me higher13Embed"

[Verse 1]
I ain't lovin' these fake hoes, room smellin' like 8 Swishers
Room service like 2K, NBA, I'm ballin', nigga
All them niggas, fallin' like Autumn, nigga
Talkin' shit, I saw them niggas, now their daughter want a picture
Rough ain't it? Fuck famous
Niggas too real, got the most haters
Wrote a story so Stephen Curry: how it feel to be golden?
Why was I chosen?
Hanalei Bay with my bae, what can I say?
I did it, my timin' was perfect, I'm comin', they know it
Becomin' the last great American poet
The flow Lindsay Lohan
Tired nigga, retire nigga
My word is art like a hieroglyphic
What island is this?
Cabernet, I can smell her talk
She wanna swim but can barely walk
She 'fraid of sharks, she'd hate my lawyer
Atlanta, Georgia, got somethin' for yah
I'm doin' somethin', stay wit' it
I sport the Oakland A fitted
Cause it's moneyball and I'm throwin' funny
But all the kids'll go get it
God dammit I'm ill
I got one question for the haters, is your girl on the pill?
I'm playin' though, but like really, really?

I'm the man forever
They can't let a nigga live cause the life is better
85 everyday, why'd I bring this sweater?
I fell asleep on the beach, tiny pink umbrella
Fell out of my drink, she yellin', ""What we doin' tonight?""
50k their first week, you ain't doin' it right
Young Bino best friends with the show promoters
Good year, my career is floatin', it's all me
Cause I stay real, the worst pain, niggas don't feel
Cause they ain't feel a nigga, tried to kill a nigga
But he still went stupid
Silver stones on her and the game so clueless
These niggas ain't us
Hopin' that I diss you back so I can make you famous
I'm just tired of haters
The AK goin' off, sound like cicadas
We the clique all day, man I'm so Decatur
Me and Fam backstage, yeah I know you hate us
But you gotta pay us
Let 'em speak at my peak in the game for a minute
But I don't know how
All these light skinned niggas came back in style
Ye lied to us, pretty girls at my concerts
Flow so cold so you know it was my verse
Stank attitude but I like the way she diddy bop
Puffin' white O's, body bang somethin' Nitty Scott
They want the old Bino so they try to rewind
The new Bino too ahead of his time
In a couple of years, they'll have to say I birthed a couple careers
Chances are I get your boy a couple of ears, you know it

And I was on every radio station
And 107.9 was 97.5 again
And they played me at Golden Glide on Friday
And they played me real loud on the street
We drive up Memorial Drive, up Wesley Chapel
I reopen 112, and Jazzy T's
I'd bring back Turner Field. I fire all the cops in Cobb county
Chick-Fil-A will be open on Sundays
I bring back LaFace Records, Freaknik, Kilo Ali, Lou
I get J.R. Crickets some Spelman girls with big booties
I reopen SciTrek, strippers will get Mother's Day off
And I'd have my own Gangsta Grillz mixtape

Centrifugal force pulling me off-course, in a horse race
Changing horses midstream, fourteenth place
On videotape surveillance playback
Sigh you lose face, disgraced, God forbid you
Fall off of the face of the Earth to chase
The black hole of what you thought it was worth today
""Don't shoot the piano player"" I heard them say
It was your fault, centrifugal force, you got caught
Convict monotonous, a verdict thoughtless
As you read it out loud, at least I was being relatively honest
Standing in your office trying to speak to some anacondas
Eking solace out of the sawdust
While your doppelganger stands topless
No one notices, they got their own dramas
Drama-rama's melodramas
You draw commas on the eyes of madonnas
And wonder why you can't turn traumas into nirvanas

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Don't mess your head up, still run with these young bucks
Still runnin' on jet fuel, still pimpin' on what-what
What was I thinkin'? I wasn't; What am I drinkin'? I'm buzzin'
Speakin' of weekends I used to fuck with your cousin
I used to rap about nothin', now I rap about nothin'
But that nothin' was somethin' that ain't nobody was bumpin'
See I still got it boo-boo, just a dad'll do you
Wonders if you don't wanna be under some gross dude

And Jojos, where the fuck my money at? (Money at)
In the hood like I'm fixin' a Pontiac (Pontiac)
On deck wit' a gang of black Kennedies
Eight goons and they all got felonies (Uh)
Still gettin' money like white folks (Woo!)
Still got quotes like Geico
I don't know French, that's ""ma faute"" (Ma faute)
Never not funny like fat jokes
(Like when someone is like, ""What happened to Chris?""
And you- you turn around and there's a fat guy that kind of looks like Chris
And you like, ""Oh shit"" and you start laughin' and shit)
And I'm back in this bitch
And I'm black and I'm rich
And I'm cashin' it in for some passion and sin (Uh, uh, uh)
For some action with them, yeah (Yeah)
Got a stank ho wit' me

Whack dudes, they like you, but only for a day or two
They hated you from now on, like D-Money

Lame song they play on, that play on (Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)

On my shit, on my dick

She like, ""Oh my God, I'm coming"" (Hehe)
I kiss her neck and she love it (Uh)
Yeah we got a safe word (Safe word), but we never use it

Bustin' out bales, I've been bustin' all day
Bustin' out bales, we were sellin' that hay
We been movin' that snow, I was ridin' that sleigh
Double cup C's, had to put them in the safe
Got the semi on deck, .45, AK
Servin' up fiend, I remember that J
Brought his daughter to the house, I was cryin' all day
L's rolled up and I'm packin' that heat
12 roll up and I'm slappin' them feet
He was only sixteen, he was lookin' at three
Now he lookin' at nine, pray to God he don't speak
Water drip rich, so we gave 'em that leak

Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy (Ayy)
Cotton ball white like hen house floors
Could've been broke, this the life I chose
They was in school, I was stirrin' that pot
Daddy couldn't come home, I was takin' that spot
Life move fast, like a movie, so quick
Dark-skinned beauty got a booty so thick
She a down-home chick, she'll hit that lick
Had to drop my old girl 'cause she think that she slick
I ain't seen him in a minute, so I think he might flip
Had to hit him with the stick, man you niggas ain't, woo
If I couldn't move bricks, I don't know what I'd do
I ain't worried 'bout mine, you can worry 'bout you

Turn that beat up for me
Really everything, like the headphones
Yeah, yeah, a little bit louder
No punch, you know that mean that we workin' hard

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]
Look, young rich nigga shit, pops was an immigrant
Lifestyle ill legit, but know I own businesses
Started out the trunk, ended up at the dealership
All gold Rollie, black face no blemishes
Legend in my city cause I grind so vigorous
If I show my face west of Texas, that's a big event
Gotta pay me twenty cents just to hear me vent
I'm really out here on some shit, you should take a flick
Ballin' on my own ten toes, so the difference is
I call shots never ask for permission, man
I got a lot of big plans in my vision and
I ain't failed yet, 'bout a dollar hell yes
I'm a problem-filled test, it's only getting worse
I swear I'm getting money, I just hope you gettin' yours
I'm killin' niggas solo so you know I'm gettin' more
Now that young Gambino on the chorus, go

[Chorus: Childish Gambino]
This is for that real shit, this is for that East side
This is for my bad girls, this is for them good guys
This is for my grandma, this is for that Westside
This is for them niggas talkin' shit on a website
Damn I feel good, you ain't feelin' nothin'
This is for my niggas who be livin' dime a dozen
Bino got that good shit, Nipsey got them aces
On some young rich shit, Kennedys with black faces
[Break: Childish Gambino]
Yeah, black faces
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
Obama on that million dollar bill, black faces
Yeah, nigga, black faces
Look, yo I got this
Yo, turn, turn it up a little
Ay, here we go, okay

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
League of my own, swag Geena Davis
Only rapper make 100k on your playlist
Niggas talk on Twitter, but in life, they don't say shit
My Rollie so racist, all black faces
We the new facet, kill 'em like Jason
Grind in my sleep man a nigga need braces
Wonder what you feelin' like, used to be the nervous type
They ain't mention Bino? Man that shit must be on purpose, right?
Hostile, nigga my style
Kind of flow to paint a picture, Norman Rockwell
I don't eat pasta, everything is low-carb
I don't fly coach now, say I fly Goyard
Leave a face covered in that coast guard
Metaphor Mozart, all we do is tell 'em the truth
M Fox to my people on some family ties
Magazines got black faces when somebody dies
I mean look at Donna Summers, she was tryin' to survive
People wrestle over petty cash
When we should be really cryin' over that one percent
Like we tipped a milk glass
Fuck y'all, I'ma let my grandkids ball
Look to the future, these dudes so last week
See me stuntin' so Conde Nasty
Me and Nipsey on some grown shit, no rent
Own shit, so Jim Crow shit, black faces

Why would you ever want to love me?
Must you love me? Oh

Digital, Childish Gambino
Mixtape demonstrations

[Verse 1: RZA]
This Oxycontin carbon monox' and toxic concoction
Collapse your brain cells, they swell from lack of oxygen
Leave the opposition stuck, without a pot to piss in
Hockin', spitting up blood, shark by sharp precision
Dart incision, darkness imparts your vision
Sparks infliction, (Poof) I'm a mad magician
Verbal plasma, verbal scatter, words that shatter
Every atom in your body, now you're anti-matter
Ripping through the data, checked into the doctor
Took his rhyme splatter, cause my mind's faster
You falling down to ground, while I climb the ladder
Too much garbage in your gallbladder, fall flatter
On your face, now you carry by the pall-bearer
Or wear the black suit, eyes all teared up
Oh no, when your ho make a boss lit up
We in the rib with a smirk nigga, all geared up
Childish Gambino or Bobby Digi'lino on the tracks
We breaking more backs that Sammartino, Bruno
We saw more baselines than Juno
Change more law in New York than Mr. Cuomo
Godfather novels I write like Mario Puzo
Master time fix the clocks like I'm Hugo
Hold the weight like nine sumos
Bust shots like John Lugo
You know how the Wu go
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Look sharp, homie give yourself a facelift
High brow, eyebrows on a spaceship
Take sips of that Ace of Spades-es
Saving all my money just to waste on a bracelet
Can't see them haters, we don't give a fuck though
Charge it to the game, keep a lame so cutthroat
Never slip a fast one, the game is so in front of me
Travel 'round the globe, spend and make 'bout a 100 G's
Pack them crowds up, boss like Bowser
Deep pocket poetry, my custom trousers
Thank God they found us, the game was starvin'
I'm clean and concrete, you ass and Charmin
Bobby Digital, do you really think these niggas know shit?
Shopping in Manhattan and I ran into my old chick
Pride is a bitch, I am not a grown up
Tweetin' when I'm 70, these half-dead followers
She look like she Spelman, secretly she Hofstra
Put her in the club, all she wanna hear is Waka
Put her in the crib, all she wanna hear is Waka
She jerk when I move like her old boy popped her
Home is that Outkast, soul like I'm Phonte
Old-school J's like Beyoncé's fiancé
Back on my dumb shit, nigga we the stupidest
Gave them niggas real shit, don't know what to do with it
I did what I did man, did you really see it though?
'Bino hard and fast, niggas Sweet'N Low
American Royalty, family loyalty
We cream of the crop why the fuck would we stop?
She had two sons: both of 'em good grades
Both of 'em rap songs
Where did she go wrong?

Damn, I guess we're all friends here
Except for I don't know you, like you was me last year
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus ""S-M""
Meaning that I fuck all girls, that is wordplay
Catch me on my iPhone doing what the birds say
I ain't going nowhere, somebody better tell a hater
He's goin' down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard, bitch, I'll fuck your fucking brains out
And make you wash your boyfriend's sheets to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on, it's time to kick the lames out
You got your favorite rapper in your ear, it's time to change out
[Chorus]
Light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put it in my video
Smarty art chicks, you can put it in my video
Dumb hoes, you can put it in my video
Smooth girls, you can put it in my video
Nerd girls, you can put it in my video

[Verse 2]
Watch your girlfriend, I'll fuck her then I up and leave her
Girls chase me like they think my dick is Justin Bieber
Pussy thrown at me, you fuckin' with a wide receiver
I'm a genius, and I ain't try to hide it either
Got a lot of hay, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
Baby girl, shorty, have it however you want it
Whatever you asking 'bout, I promise you that I done it
My swagger's New York but my home is the South
And it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf
And I'm all up in your ear but then I'm all in your mouth
I don't talk, but girls the only thing we're talkin' about

[Chorus]
Light-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Dark-skinned girls, you can put it in my video
Thick girls, you can put it in my video
Thin girls, you can put it in my video
Smarty art chicks, you can put it in my video

I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Sick boi make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
Let me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried 'bout my wallet being empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin' with my Walkman, freestyle rappin'
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin' shot the captain
And this is me relaxing, rappin' is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin' old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith, went off without a hitch, man
C-H-I-L-D is the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listenin'

[Verse 2]
I'ma try to make my street cred stack up
I mean I'm rapping over Grizzly Bear, what the fuck?
Gather swagger up, before I take it all
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
I make your iPod hotter than a lighter would
Picture me in sixth grade, overweight, overbite
Got my fake Adidas on, whiting out the fourth stripe
Kid named Vincent got it out for me, I hate that guy
Frodo from Chicago, really small and shy
You better recognize, cause I know better now
Cause I was always sick, my life's a hospital
And that's some funny shit, that turd is Apatow
That female dog is blind, well bitch look at me now!
I'm wearing tight jeans and nobody's laughing
More pussy than recycled sanitary napkins
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
I did exactly what you niggas said would never happen
I'm doing me so big I can hardly walk
These rappers need ER like they're Charlie Park
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kind of music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
Yes I'm grown and sexy and I'm worth the wait
Girls act like I'm the only dude on earth to date
Put these words on your head and let them percolate
We need to separate, nigga church and state
I used to have to pay for gas in my mama's Saturn
And now I'm paying for a mortgage as a working actor
If living my life is what you say you're chasing after
Nigga stop talking shit and just be a rapper (Be a rapper)12Embed"

Now it's the B to the izzo
You know what it is I'mma stunt on the d-low
Watch me get it in, spin in the seat, black as can be
Rolling it up, giving a fuck, like I'm a slut
""Bino that's my baby what he doin out at the club?""
Fuck about your dress code, my dress code is I got a big bank roll
I think so, time to give these niggas something else
Island in the summer best believe that shit ain't common wealth
Smile on her face best believe she wearing nothing else
Watch the sun set that's a feeling that she never felt
We were born free, that's my God given
How a god living? Fantastic, fans spazz when they see  ya man passing
I'm in the Aston Martin, unforgivable blackness beg your pardon
On my Jack Johnson nigga, all my shows sell tix like Boston nigga
Put this on at the cook out, let me see you shmoney
Old school on the XM got your Auntie singing ""Hola Hola Ayy""
Hit the dream too hard, I'm the new young god
This the new mixtape, but it's still the same game
How you gon be the don, when Don half my name?
How you gon be the G.O.A.T, when we are not the same?
I be feeling all this money but motherfuck the fame
It's the young Bino, I'm in your bae like Oakland
In my bed out of breath I never been this open
If you niggas can't hear me it's the weed I'm smoking
When I opened up the door I had the manager coughing like
""The hotels charging you a maintenance fee""
Gave that nigga 2 stacks and said I'm here all week
Let me roll OG, let me talk my shit
How you hotter than me? You ain't got no hits
You just got a hot feature
Bare sole on the track so my feet hurt
Do some research, know my origin
I'm the new black, fuck oranges
Yeah, that's that nigga that yall love to hate
Redbone like golden gate
Childish y'all know the name, getting hate from Charlemagnes
Last year things done changed, I was thinking bout killing y'all
I was working all night long, white bitches like King Kong
Getting money my theme song, do whatever I want
Fuck your clique do what I want, fuck your bitch do what I want
Here's some shit you niggas didn't know
Probably wrote your nigga verse
Probably wrote your nigga video
High as fuck on Arsenio
Chosen, now they show me my respect nigga
Frozen, Disney movie round his neck nigga
I told ya, I'm the best right now
From Atlanta where them niggas in your chest like ""blow""
Royalty equal sign black philosophers
Became a top 5 cause nobody else was stopping us
They want me Hopsin but I'm popping and getting confident
God forbid we give him props for the job he did
Man his knob need some slobbering
I mean, fuck, do you want more?
I'm killing these niggas and still on tour
Fuck is y'all for?

This is for all of y'all
One day everyone's falling off
So right now we should all ball out

Fifteen nines, five dimes, only two chains
Smoke like Jamaicans, run it like I’m Usain

[VISUAL]

The Boy lies, arms to his side, on his bed, looking at the ceiling

Spiders slowly drop from single strands of web from all the posts on the bed. It looks pretty. All of them dropping simultaneously swaying together. They whisper:

......where are you?
................who is this?
...don't slide

It's almost a song

*******[PLAY SONG ""THE WORST GUYS"" AT THIS POINT]*******

INT. MANSION - NIGHT
More people are at the house. People drinking and smoking. Shoes off. It's a Temple. Respect it

The back wall of the living room has been pushed into the wall, so there's a seamless transiting from living room to backyard patio

People sit on the swings underneath space heaters

EMILY is in the middle of the pool table. Swank plays pool around her. RUBEN is filming Marcus and Steve throwing things in the fire pit
AJ is djing in the middle of the living room

Some guy is running through the living room in just a towel. He is dripping water. He almost slips

The projector room (theatre) is playing Fight/Vine compilations. Two dudes are in there not watching. Just smoking

The Boy walks through the backyard. There's a dude and a girl making out on the bar outside. They're sitting on the bar

       THE BOY: Don't sit on that

They look at him. He stares back. They get down. He walks away. They stare as he leaves. The Boy walks to the edge of the pool and looks at the ocean go into the sky

       THIS KID IN A HAT (laughing/whisper): Hurry!

This kid in a hat and his friend are running out the front door with an iPad and a midi controller. The Boy walks inside. Marcus stops him. He's out of breath and looks wet

       THE BOY: Some guys just stole some stuff

       MARCUS: Please tell me you saw that Argentinan...Argentinian? Argentina-girl. I can't say it-

       THE BOY: Stop inviting random niggas in here. If you don't know their names they can't come

       MARCUS: I don't hear you right now. I just fucked in a steam shower and I feel CRAZY. It's like I came in a Prince video. I like, blacked out. Couldn't breath in there, mane. I- (wait) Fuck! Is she still in there? You think she's okay? (He thinks)

       THE BOY: You're the Florida of my friends
The Boy walks away

INT. FATHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The Boy walks up to the door. Before he can open it, Sasha opens it from the inside. She's with another girl. It feels like they just did a drug or were stealing something themselves

Sasha sees The Boy. Startled. Then she smirks

       SASHA: Come in! Quick!

[VISUAL]

She pulls him in. The other girl flops on the bed

       OTHER GIRL: UUUUUGGGGHHHHHHH. SOOOOO SOOOOOFFFFTTT

       SASHA: Hurry, hurry, hurry. Scoot, scoot

The Boy lays against the wall. Sasha sits on the bed

Silence. Then:

       SASHA (CONT'D): Show us your dick

       THE BOY: Wha?
       SASHA: Do it. Show it

       OTHER GIRL: Ew

Silence

       THE BOY: Ha

Silence

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Why?

       SASHA: Cause it's probably gross and I wanna laugh at it

       OTHER GIRL: I've never seen a black dick. Is it purple?

       SASHA: Grape dick

       OTHER GIRL (agreeing): Grape dick

Sasha gets up and starts to punch The Boy playfully. The other girl is laughing crazy

       SASHA: Do it. Don't be weird!

       OTHER GIRL: Let's be weird a little!

The punches slowly stop. Then Sasha starts kissing The Boy. You can't see below their waist, but stuff is going on. Then stuff stops

       SASHA: What's wrong? This is weird?

       THE BOY: No

       SASHA: You don't want to? This is weird?

       THE BOY: No. I want to

       SASHA: Then...what's going on, chum?

       THE BOY: Hold on

The Boy plays with his dick. Nothing. It's like gum

Silence. Fidgeting. Sasha's got a [ASHAMED EMOJI] look on her face

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Hold on

He walks into the bathroom and closes the door. Locked. Silence. Sasha sits on the floor

       OTHER GIRL: What's up?

*******[PLAY SONG ""SHADOWS"" AT THIS POINT]*******
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The Boy sits on the floor. Head in hands

Damn, guy

The Boy's ex-girlfriend steps out of the linen closet

[VISUAL]

       VANESSA: What are you doing?

       THE BOY (head in hands): Chillin

       VANESSA: In the Bathroom?

       THE BOY: Mmm-hmm

       VANESSA: Well, I want to go out

       THE BOY (""no""): Mmm-mmm

Vanessa playfully throws things from the counter at him (toothbrush, cup, floss, soap). He throws some of it back. She starts laughing. He pulls her to the ground with him

       VANESSA: Why are you so moody?

       THE BOY: I'm not. Let me enjoy this for a second

       VANESSA: We can do this outside, [EDIT]

       THE BOY: We could live the rest of our lives here. There's a TV in the mirror. There's fresh water every time we flush. I heard they're building a sandwich place in the shower

Vanessa smh and smiles

       VANESSA: Get up. We're going

       THE BOY: Come 'on-

       VANESSA: I mean it!

She pulls him up. She opens up the linen closet and pulls The Boy in

Coachella is inside the closet

There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose today. It's a great time

The Boy chases after Vanessa and catches her. He carries her for like three steps, then they walk together, holding hands

       VANESSA (CONT'D): We have to see everything together. I don't wanna split up this time. We each get to choose one band the other one can't make you see- (then) What's wrong?

       THE BOY (smh): ...

       VANESSA (disappointed): Really?...You're really doing this to me? Right now?

       THE BOY: You don't think this is a waste of our time?

       VANESSA: No, I don't think me and you together is a waste of time. That's what you think. And I'm tired of trying to convince you otherwise. At least be a man and break up with me instead of telling me I don't like you

       THE BOY: But you don't! You don't really like me. I just look good when you scroll past me with the rest of your ""I'm almost Vashtie"" bullshit

[NO MOUTH EMOJI]

       VANESSA (teary whisper): You're so mean

       THE BOY: I'm trying to be honest

       VANESSA: Mean doesn't mean honest! Honest can mean mean. But only if you mean it

       THE BOY (so many ""means""): Wait...the-

       VANESSA: I'm trying so hard with you. But I'm not gonna carry us. I won't waste your time anymore

She starts walking away. Then she looks to the sky and shoots up like a rocket
She looks like a shooting star in the sky. Not a sound is heard while this happens. They never see each other again

Then the coyotes come out

They're glowing blue. They're circling and they're talking about music

       WOLF 1: What'd you think of 2 Chainz' set?

       WOLF 2: It was really fun. His live shows have gotten way better. I saw him last spring in Chicago

       WOLF WITH GLASSES: Have you heard that Roc Marciano album on vinyl? It's so good, man

       MESSY, BUT COOL WOLF: You guys, this is my fiance, another wolf. He or she works in a small music or graphic design for niche clothing or this app I'm building

They rip The Boy to shreds while they talk. Blood everywhere. The Boy doesn't make a sound. Lets it happen

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

The Boy realizes he is pacing in the shower. He's been in there for a minute, cause the water is cold

He opens the door. The girls are gone. The small clock on the desk says ""5:23 AM"". There's also a note written in lipstick on the mirror that says ""YOUR FUCKED"" (smh at the ""your""). Probably Sasha. She's probably right
CUT TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house isn't totalled, just dirty. Empty cups, bottles, cigarette butts, etc. The Boy sees Steve and Swank passed out on the couch

       THE BOY: Let's go guys

       STEVE (waking up): Where we going?

       THE BOY: Oakland

       SWANK: When's the flight leave?

       THE BOY: We're driving

       SWANK: Wha? (then) How'd we get poor?

INT. FAM'S ROOM - NIGHT

Fam's sleeping. There's a naked girl sleeping with him. The Boy comes in

       THE BOY: We're going

The Boy leaves. Fam opens his eyes

CUT TO:

*******[PLAY SONG ""TELEGRAPH AVE."" AT THIS POINT]*******

EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

Swank, Steve, and Fam are asleep in the car. The Boy sits down in the driver's seat

       He pulls out his phone and texts someone named NYALA:

Im driving up now

...(that moment you know exactly what they're typing and how they look doing it)
       She writes back: DONT

The Boy looks at this. Then starts up the car and turns on the radio and speeds out of the driveway

A moment passes...

Then we see the girl that was in bed with Fam walk out in the Mansion doorway

       THAT GIRL FAM KNOWS FROM THAT ONE PLACE: Fam?
EXT. I-5 - NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

Everyone's asleep in the car except The Boy who's driving (AJ is there too. They picked him up.). Lloyd's ""Oakland"" is playing on the radio. The Boy turns it up so he feels like he's in a video. He pushes his seat back so he can lean

       SWANK: Ow, ow!

He slammed Swanks knees. Sorry
The Boy speeds through the empty highway. It's really pretty. I'm not sure what those factories are in the middle of nowhere with all the lights on them. They're probably horrible for the earth, but they look really magical at night. He passes one of those factories

There's a lot of rolling hills. Lotta farms. There's a slaughterhouse. Smells and looks grey and awful. All the cows look really sad. Maybe I'm just making them sad. Maybe they're fine

Looking at the rows of crops criss-cross on farms as they pass

There's a billboard. It says: ROSCOE'S WETSUIT

The Boy stares at it. Just a white billboard with ""roscoe's wetsuit"" on it

EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN-N-OUT - DAY

The guys are sitting on their car, eating burgers at the far end of the parking lot

As The Boy bites into his double-double he thinks about the slaughterhouse. Then he looks at his burger. He laughs

Two women walk out. They look like they're in their late 30s. Swank spots em. One of the women is wearing a Northwestern hoodie

       SWANK (re: hoodie): Long way from Chicago

       WOMAN 1: Alumni

       SWANK: There's no way. You can't be over twenty-three

The women just smirk and close their doors. They drive off

       SWANK (CONT'D): See that? Johnny Appleseed of confidence, man. Just leaving little seeds with everyone

A car crazily pulls up next to the In-N-Out. Two dudes jump out with masks and guns

       FAM: Daaammmmnnn

They run inside. We see people running in their cars, and driving off. All of our guys stay seated on their car. Just eating

A minute goes by. No gun shots. Just yelling

The two dudes run out. Just as they do, you can hear the police coming

       ROBBERY DUDE 1: MOVE, RYAN!

       AJ: This nigga's using his real name. Treated

       STEVE: Could be a code name

       AJ: That's definitely his real name. No one's robbery name is ""Ryan"". It's something like...""Snake-Man""

They all make a face

       AJ (CONT'D): Fuck ya'll. I wouldn't rob a place with ya'll pussy ass anyway

The Police roll up. Ryan tries to get away, but they pin him. The other dude shoots at the cop

       FAM: We should leave. They're shooting at the cops. Which means the other cops coming give a fuck 'bout bystanders now

       MARCUS (in anchorman voice): Two men were arrested in an attempted robbery at an In-N-Out burger today. (mumbling) Also some niggers ended up dead, we don't know. This is news, people!

       STEVE: After being frisked, the dead suspects somehow got guns and shot themselves in the head even though they were handcuffed and in the back of a tiny-ass squad car

       THE BOY: Police chief states: ""no investigation needed""

       STEVE: ""White people still safe!""

They laugh. As they start to drive off

Suddenly two cop cars screech in front of them

       COP 1: HANDS IN THE AIR!

       STEVE: Fuck

All of the guys put their hands up

CUT TO:

EXT. OAKLAND STREET - DAY

Everyone looks a little bummed. Silence. More silence

       THE BOY: We're here

They pull over to a row of brownstones

       MARCUS: Great. Why are we where is this?

The Boy gets out of the car and walks up to the door. As he's about to knock, the door opens. Nyla is standing there. Her face is a mix of anger and strange

Sympathy. Like she refused to cry like...an hour ago?

       THE BOY: Hey-

       NYLA: There's a point you reach when you're no longer able to feel like you did. Not about a person, not with a certain place, you just can't feel like you did because that muscle or whatever is just...dead. Or gone

       THE BOY: Hi, Nyla

       NYLA: When you're alone, you might be able to remember it. You might even hear a song that makes you question it. But you don't have it. It doesn't exist anymore. It's dead. Do you understand?

       THE BOY: Yes. Absolutely. But Nyla-

       NYLA: I AM AT THAT POINT, [EDIT]

Tears. She's not crying. She's just that mad

A dude pokes his head out from the hallway in the brownstone. The Boy and him make eye contact

       THE BOY: This isn't what you think it is. I didn't come here to...look, I saw this dude die and-

       NYLA: And you're scared. So you came here

       THE BOY: I'm not scared. I just wanna be with someone
Who knows me for a little

       NYLA: I don't know you. We're not together. I have company. Go home

       THE BOY: Okay, you're being mean now

       NYLA: ""Mean?"" Who cares? You're an adult. Also, you embarrassed me

       THE BOY (to the dude in the hallway): We were planning on having a kid together. She offered and we had a whole plan. Like adults or something. Then I backed out. So... (then) You're second at best is what I'm saying

The guy goes -__- [SIDE EYE EMOJI]

       NYLA: What is wrong with you?

       THE BOY: I don't know

       NYLA: Me neither

This is really sad for both of em. They really wanna know. Nyla closes the door

       NYLA (CONT'D through the door): Please grow up
The Boy stands there...then Swank walks up to him on the stoop of the brownstone

       SWANK: Can I use her bathroom? That double-double's makin moves

The Boy walks away and gets in the car. Swank stands there for a moment. Then tries to cut off a fart with his hand as he walks to the car

CUT TO:

*******[PLAY SONG ""SWEATPANTS"" AT THIS POINT]*******
INT. OAKLAND CLUB - NIGHT

The guys sit at a table in the corner. The Boy is sitting in the corner. Fam is texting. Swank and Steve are talking to two girls. A promoter walks over

       PROMOTER: Ey. You gonna just sit here

       THE BOY: Yeah

       PROMOTER: Well, you gotta order something

       THE BOY: A bottle?

       PROMOTER: Yeah. A bottle

They stare

       THE BOY: I'll take 12 bottles

Promoter gives him a [NO MOUTH EMOJI]. The Boy just stares at him...he's serious. The promoter walks off

CUT TO:

Twelve girls with bottles and sparklers emerge around the club from the back. It's a parade. They curve around the club making a big to do. People are staring, like ""is Diddy here? OMG Diddy's here!""

The parade gets to the top of the stairs where the booth is. But when they turn the corner, the guys are gone already. There's a stack of cash sitting in the middle of the table

The promoter stands there

INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT

[VISUAL]

The guys are eating

       SWANK: But animals eat animals, man. Animals!

       STEVE: The argument is that we've been given the freewill and understanding of life. So we shouldn't because the option is there for us

       SWANK: Man, in Nigeria they made me AND my little brother slaughter a goat. We raised that goat, man. I loved that fucking goat. And one day we came home from school and they just handed us the knife. I've seen the blood man. I've heard the screams. I still ate the shit though


...I was here before


       THE BOY: We were here before

       FAM: What?

       THE BOY: We've done this before

       FAM: Nah man. This is our first time together in Oakland

       THE BOY: This is every night. This is all the nights, man

       FAM (weirded out): Nahhhh. We switch it up, man

The Boy stops listening. Across the way there's a group of kids eating in a booth

They're laughing and talking behind the back of a friend they don't seem to like very much. One of the girls is going in. But behind her, there's a guy in a colorful faux 90's hat. He's writing something on the wall in sharpie

He's writing ""roscoe's wetsuit""

The Boy gets up and walks over

       THE BOY: Excuse me. What does that mean?

       HAT KID: What?

       THE BOY: Roscoe's wetsuit

       HAT KID: Oh. I don't know

       THE BOY: Yes you do

       HAT KID: Wha?

       THE BOY: You know what it means. Tell me

       HAT KID: I don't know. I saw it online

       THE BOY: So you just write shit you see?

       HAT KID: Fuck's your problem?

Fam walks up. Grabs The Boy

       FAM: Ey. Let's just eat

The Boy and Fam sit

       HAT KID: It means I sat on your mom's face

The Boy SLAMS his fist on the table. It's loud. Everyone in the diner looks at him. The Boy doesn't look up

       THE BOY (quiet): Tell me what it is or I'll cut you open and take the answer

Silence

CUT TO:

EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT
The guys roll up to the front of the hotel

       SWANK: That kid was scared as fuck! He was like [OPEN MOUTH EMOJI]

       FAM (to The Boy): You good?

Boy doesn't say anything

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
The guys walk in the lobby. There's an Indian wedding happening. They're probably not called Indian weddings. It's probably just a wedding, but all the people participating happen to be Indian. There's a bunch of guys talking and quietly laughing in the hall. The door to the banquet room is open as they pass. The Boy stops. The bride and groom are slow dancing. The Bride is quite pretty. Green eyes and dark skin. She's got the aura of a business woman. Probably met him at Stanford and was like ""this is reliable"". The groom looks like a caricature of a good ol' fashion white dude

       STEVE: Good for him

       SWANK: Nah. He don't get any interracial points. He's just doing what white guys been doing since forever. Exactly what he wants

       AJ: Really? Like that?

       SWANK: Man, I used to get so pissed when girls would watch Boy Meets World and be like ""Ryder Strong's so dope for having a black girlfriend"". Man, fuck that nigga

       AJ: Come on, man. My dad's white and his parents didn't like my mom. They just started talking again

       SWANK (over the top): Oh you're poor white dad! (then) Nigga, shut up. Take that team light skin shit outside

       THE BOY: I've never seen one of these

       FAM: A first dance?

       THE BOY: A wedding

       FAM: Yeah. (then) Marriage is so wack. I mean, I get it. But come on, yo. Forever? (""Ms. Jackson"") Forever, ever? Forever, ever?

       THE BOY: You think either of them don't wanna do it?

       FAM: Mane, I bet both of em are like that

       THE BOY: They look happy as fuck though

       FAM: Cause they reached their goal. In a year they'll
Be like ""oh fuck...goals are dumb.""

       MARCUS: Goals are dumb?

       FAM: Making your life a goal is dumb. I think. This shit is supposed to be just fun. (then) I took an edible at the diner. It's kickin in. Hard. I'mma go upstairs

       THE BOY: Okay

They both stand there for a moment

       FAM: I'm gonna need some help

AJ takes Fam by the arm

       FAM (CONT'D): There we go

They head to the elevators

       MARCUS: I'mma look for some bridesmaids

He walks off

       STEVE (yelling to Marcus): Gee-van-chi!

       MARCUS (calling back): Nigga, god bless you

       STEVE (to The Boy): What you doin?

The Boy stares at the couple

       THE BOY: I'mma stay down here

       SWANK: You good?

       THE BOY: I'm great

They Kanye shrug, then walk off to the bar. The Boy walks into the banquet

INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT

The lights are low. Most of the people have gotten up to pee or something. The Boy just stares at the couple. Then he decides to start recording. A man comes up to him

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE:Who are you here with?

       THE BOY (not looking up from his phone): The groom. We went to college together

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh. (then) Nice isn't it?

       THE BOY (sincere): Beautiful

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: When the buddies start getting
Married, that means you're next

       THE BOY: I don't think so

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's what everyone says. That's what I said thirty years ago

       THE BOY: I don't believe in marriage. (then) Maybe that's not true. But I am against it

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: What do you believe in?

       THE BOY: Cool baby mamas

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Ahhhhh. But how many women you know are interested in your concept?

       THE BOY: More than you'd think. I find if you have a job and are actually interested in raising a child, women, who are a little older, tend to be responsive. I just don't think they like being labeled that. (then) Do you get tired of it?

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Of marriage?

       THE BOY: Of marriage. Of her. Of yourself

He thinks

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Yes. Sometimes

       THE BOY: Then why?

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: I had to man-up. It was time. I
Don't regret it

       THE BOY: Well I don't have to man-up. I did what I'm supposed to do. I found the things I'm good at. I didn't get anyone pregnant on the way there. And I've had mature relationships that prepared me for what marriage is

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Mature relationships?

       THE BOY: Yeah. I keep in touch with all my exes. We're all friends

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: You still call them

       THE BOY: I send em a happy birthday text or DM 'em

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's not a friend. I do that with my boss. And I hate my boss. (to himself) Fuckin Korean kid thinks he know everything

Silence

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE (CONT'D): What do you do?

       THE BOY: I troll celebrities, politicians, or anyone with large enough online cache until I get a response. I post those responses and/or convos on my blog. And I charge gossip blogs and advertisers to advertise on my site and sometimes me and my friend put out novelty books of fucked up things we find online while digging up dirt on said celebrities and/ or politicians and sell it to niche book stores or larger stores that fit our aesthetic

The man just stares, not understanding

       THE BOY (CONT'D): How old are you?

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Fifty-three

       THE BOY: I'm like Bill O'Reilly

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh

The older man leaves. A shlubby man in a suit comes to the podium in front. People clap for the end of the dance

       MAN IN SUIT: I've known Safia and Greg since college and I honestly knew this day would happen since we were getting high in my dorm room junior year at GW. (to mom) Sorry Mrs. Healey, Greg smokes weed. You gotta deal!

Everyone laughs

       MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): But honestly, may you two spend the rest of your lives healthy and happy

""Awwww""

       MAN IN SUIT (CONT'D): And now, the traditional ""march to forever"" to bless the bride and groom with happiness for all their days to come

Everyone claps
*******[PLAY SONG ""3005"" AT THIS POINT]*******

[VISUAL]
Little creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. Some have banners that say ""HAPPY MARRIAGE!"". Some have sparklers. They all bounce on beat. It's cute for a very short moment. Then it feels wrong

All the creatures have two legs, two arms, like humans.  But they are definitely not humans. One of the giveaways being that they are naked, but don't seem to have genitals

All the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths (their noses being two tiny slits probably don't allow for heavy air traffic)

They're about three feet high. Their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces. They don't have hair anywhere on their bodies. They all have forced smiles on their faces. You can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile. Insinuating carnivorous behavior. If they wanted to, at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in .8 seconds. But they're not right now. They're marching
One of the creatures has tears in its eyes. Still smiling tho. Pushing the smile

Everyone is smiling as they march past, but they're all very cautious. Clearly worried that one may attack. The Boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle. They do this weird clapping, almost step team routine, then stop. The music stops

       CREATURE 1: We did it!

       CREATURE 2: Yay!

Everyone claps. The bride and groom force a smile. The creatures slowly make their way back to the kitchen. All that's heard is their struggled breathing and clammy skin hitting the wooden dance floor. One stares at The Boy as he (or she) leaves

...that was unacceptable. [LEMONGRAB: UNNACCEPTABLE!]RAP GENIUS NOTE: This is the end of Part 2, continue on at Part 315Embed"

I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all

[Verse 1]
Tell em what it is, I'm takin great strides
Hood niggas, hipsters, I ain't trying to take sides
Ex-Girlfriend on my mind, she really fucked me up
Doing shots of whiskey 'till my friends are saying thats enough
I really really miss her, sometimes I wanna fuck it all
Mix some warm Guinness with 20 tablets of tylenol
Call 'em while I'm drifting off, tell her that I love her so
Parents crying harder cause I didn't even leave a note
Saying that I'm selfish and I'm sorry that I left
But it hurts so much to wake up and I left you guys a check
Cause I ain't fucking happy, you don't know shit about me
I think it started when she said she happier without me
I really can't blame her cause I'm happier without me
I don't see what girls are seeing when they say they're all about me
I'm scared they wanna trap me, these hoes are all liars
I double bag my shit and never cum while I'm inside her
I used to be a sweet dude, now I'm so angry
Look at what these girls and these fake niggas made me
Cry when I'm writing, I don't really know why
I think its cause I can't really see myself an old guy
And that scares me, I wanna be around a while
But I feel my purpose goes beyond having raised a child
Bright lights, they tend to burn out fast
So I shine bright, but I'm scared that it won't last
[Hook]
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all
I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, I'mma fuck it all
Fly around the world, eating good, drinking alcohol
You ain't nothing like me, nigga, not at all

[Verse 2]
I'm just about the pop, the industry just noticed it
People watching me, I feel like Amber Rose's tits
Friends of mine are over it, people say I changed
And I tell them that I'm glad, cause I don't wanna stay the same
Cause I used to be poor, I used to be unconfident
I used to hate these haters, now its just the opposite
Not only have I changed, I'm becoming something better
And revenge is for the weak, so I have settled my vendettas
With all of the kids who made my early life a living hell
And I hope you're doing well and feeling better 'bout yourself
Don't know if you can tell, but change is usually for the better
I used to like these bitches but couldn't afford to get em
But now I'll take your girl, yeah player pay homage
That's why I fuck these bad mamas, Kate Gosselin
I'm trying to tell the world I'm nothing to be trifled with
Donald Glover staying hotter than some rifle spit
They only wanna fuck with you after you made your way
But when you started out you couldn't pay em to stay
But now I got em lined up in the lobby door
It makes me wonder what this rapping shit's a hobby for
Oh thats right, because I'm gifted in another field, and another field, and another field
They say my public persona don't have enough appeal
I take a lesson from Kanye and give em something real
I'm getting all this attention I wanna do it right
That's why I'm performing for you like every single night
To all my fans who's saying Donald Glover about to blow
Just give me six months so you can say I told you so

I ain't gonna be around for ever, so fuck it all
Seeing all this pussy, Imma fuck it all

I'm the last of a dying breed
Meaning that I’m not afraid to try a new thing
Can't see me, best to get yourself some Visine
Toe tag a motherfucker
No jokes while these other niggas ""wakka wakka""
Other rappers try and go and get over
You want that hood shit? Best to go and call Hova
I was a good kid, backpack on my shoulder
98 test score in my ThunderCat folder
My cousin was older, my mama used to wake up
Drive me to his school 'cause his school was much safer
But I slipped up and accidentally told a teacher
Now I'm going to a school where I get beat up
Because I ain't get down with them other kids
Probably 'cause I talk too white and I got a dad who's there
Mama couldn't take it, sold the place and got us out of there
Guest room, now the six of us splitting one with a restroom
Now I'm going to this school called Rockbridge
School of the neighborhood we tryna buy a house in
There's not a lot of black kids
So I stick out like a sore thumb with some bad acne
But really, what I wanna know is why I never fit in right
Like a fat dude getting on a packed flight
Even when I make friends in the hallways
I'm wishing I was someone else always
But I'm happy that that shit happened to me
'Cause it taught me most important is to do me
'Cause everybody hates you till they love you
Facebook niggas same niggas that would shove you
'Cause nobody was jocking my style
'Cause I had a high voice, they called me faggot 8 Mile
So I stopped writing for a very long time
Thinkin' that a nigga wasn't made to bust rhymes
And this next part, sounds like nonsense
But I swear to God, Tina Fey gave me confidence
Taught me everything that is good comes from honesty
Everybody's got a voice, you just gotta follow it
She on her role model shit
From the day that I shook her hand
I knew that I'd never die a broke man
So I could try this rapping shit out again
The game need change, I'm a part of it
People tell me I should spit under Donald Glover
But I try to keep my real name undercover
'Cause if you hear my name, then you think it's jokes
And I can't go for that, nigga; Hall and Oates
My nigga stay down like a winter coat
I rap about my life, not ""I'm On a Boat""
'Cause this joke rap shit's gotten out of hand
Only ones who do it well's Lonely Island
Save the raps about your cat, I am not a fan
Leave the joke raps alone, man I'm working here
I do not play around with this bullshit
I am different, call it new shit
Labels want me to hurry and cash my check in
But I keep my shit free till the last possible second
'Cause God knows that I don't need the money
You get your clothes free when you rich, ain't it funny?
But this limelight burn like a muh'fuck
I wanna call my dad crying but I hang up
'Cause I don't want him to worry, he's got his own shit
So I send him a check and tell him to hold it
If anything ever happens, want you to know this
I always took the time to smell the roses
And wherever I am, I am doing fine
I'm here for a good, not a long, time10Embed"

As time goes on (Hello?, hello?)
Your talk keeps getting smaller (Hello?, hello?)
As Childish lives in his short shorts,
He's got no time for your short money!

[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
Two gold chains and I still don't never wear 'em
Why would I wear 'em? Cheese like a camera
Spendin' money son a bitch nigga like Sanford
I'm lookin' in the mirror, I'm like 'Damn, I'm so handsome'
If it ain't 'bout that money, why a young god answer?
Ghost on my wrist (wrist), got me so Casper
Flow so cold, watch them haters get asthma
And every time we fuckin', man she think that's the last one

[Hook: Kari Faux]
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
[Verse 2: Kari Faux]
Three cellphones and I still don't ever call 'em
Why would I call 'em?  Bitch you know I'm ballin'
Spendin' money, make it bounce back like Spalding (Swish)
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans
And he ain't talkin' money nigga, why the fuck you talkin'
All my bitches bossy, all my diamonds flossy
Rap game sriracha man you know I'm saucy
I got a white dude in Boston, he whip an Audi

[Hook: Kari Faux]
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk
Bitch I'm takin' calls, no small talk

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Young Bino, we be mobbin'
You don't see me, I'm on an island
These haters left us no choice
Leave the trap like so moist
Little rock like dope boys
Oh my God, I'm out of fucks
Colombian but she ain't a plug
That's racist
In '96 I had K-swiss
You 96 with some fake bitch
And I 69'd with a bunch of dimes and that money talk my language
Head game so Cambridge
God damn, you dirty...
You were lettin' me bust in it
But if they ask I plead the fifth
[Bridge: Kari Faux]
Ok this the part where I need ya'll to make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Make it bounce, make it bounce like Spalding
Got a new nigga and he say he from New Orleans

This is Royalty
Bang bang

[Verse 1: Gonage]
I got yo bitch layin' naked 'cross the bed, no rosary
Stackin' up this bread like a baker, Josephine
She wanna refill, so I get that ho a bean
Niggas on the sideline yellin' ""Who the fuck is he?""
Bitch I'm @Gonage, you can call me Cody B
Wardrobe overseas, passports all over me
White leather seats lookin' like coca leaf
Every time I crank up the woofer sittin' on a key
I'm Gucci buckled up, house note on my feet
Linen button-up like I'm walkin' round on the beach
Blind hoes notice me in my Range Rover Jeep
So they wanna come and talk to me like Jodeci
Smokin' in the morning, and when I go to sleep
Blowin' presidential man, I think they 'about to vote for me
Any event we party like a frat, no toga sheet
If money ain't the convo, they ain't even 'posed to speak

[Chorus: Gonage]
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Cody Bean Senior, pushin' mean ether
You don't know Childish? Nigga, me neither
Eastside Atlanta, flyest nigga in a Waffle House
If it ain't money, man, we ain't got shit to talk about
Kennedy compound, my 20-room house
So big my ex-girls ain't gotta move out
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
My bank account looking like when little kids break shit—""Oooh!""
If I'm breathin' I can handle it
Watching all my dreams get together like an ampersand
Blueprint the new shit, mixtape management
Show these dummies how to do it, all I want's my ten percent
Porsche brand new, passed 'em a cool hundred
Yeah my girl 5'2"", even her growth stunted
It's the nigga y'all knew back when I flipped meal cards
Now my meals free when I don't taste the fifth star
We can make arrangements, old money Cambridge
Meetin' with the moguls, make 'em richer and they owe you
It's the kid you used to talk about, I'm watchin' people get up on it
On Worldstar and I ain't have to have a nigga moment
Flow's always cold, keep the whole soul anemic
Never left that hard shit, a nigga's always constipated
Got the change for my cousin on froze, no more movin' weight
Flossin' hard, ice king, no more Finn and Jake
Love or hate you gotta say the hype is something handsome
As long as all of 'em bloggin' I'm living Richard Branson
Shit talk is still talk, haters are my billboard
Used to take the Q home, now I hang with ScHoolboy
So iconic, Black Kennedy this shit
Man I'm so ironic, man this ratchet need a fix
Droppin' new shit and the haters get the splashback
Don't be surprised when he ask you where the cash at
[Chorus: Gonage]
If you ain't talkin' cash, don't say shit
In the VIP we champagne-spray shit
I'm in the club lookin' like a bank statement
If you talkin' cash, I can make arrangement
Walked in the club, ain't pay shit
Broke niggas hate, cause they ain't shit
I'm gettin' to the cash pockets on payment
If you talkin' money, I can make arrangement

I can feel it deep inside my body
I've been watching all this all night

This pressure brewing
This world don't feel alright
