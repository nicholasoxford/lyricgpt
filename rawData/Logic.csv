I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Logic]
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die today, I just wanna die
I don't wanna be alive, I don't wanna be alive
I just wanna die
And let me tell you why

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down, but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
[Chorus: Logic]
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die today, you don't gotta die
I want you to be alive, I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die, now let me tell you why
[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath when your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air when you're there chest-to-chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long, seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did

[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
[Chorus: Logic]
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today, I don't wanna die
I finally wanna be alive, I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive, I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh, I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore814Embed"

I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah, they know what I'm about
And I dare you to test me
'Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration
But I'm full of innovation
And I'm tired of all of this high school ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?
Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga, shit

There's nowhere to hide, we call this shit genocide
Hit 'em with that (Do-do-do) and they die
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide
I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' get smacked
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said ""Rover"" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
I'm lookin' for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin'
Batterin' everything and I've had it with the inadequate
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
I'm 'bout to bare-knuckle it, nah, fuck it
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket
Abraca-fuckin'-dabra
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
I'm up, back with a thud
Man, stop
[Outro: Chris D'Elia]
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins

You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'

[Verse 1]
Livin' life like this
Gotta paint a picture when I write like this
Tales from my hood, not a sight like this
Where they up to no good on a night like this
And they murder motherfuckers just 'cause
Type of shit I see, you probably wonder where I was
I was in the crib, just sittin' on the rug
Basedheads comin' through lookin' for the plug
Now, born and raised in my area
Beautiful by day, by night it's hysteria
Fuck around and bury ya tonight
Ridin' with my homies on sight
Momma tell me to come in at night
Now I really gotta go, but they never know
Livin' life to the fullest, I gotta blow
Po-po finna bust in the door, we got blow in the crib
In the kitchen over there next to the baby with the bib
Goddamn, what it feel like, middle of the night
Wakin' up, scared for my life
Never had the heat, just a knife
When the gat go blat like that
Guarantee you it’s a wrap
Finna put you on your back like that
Just breathe, while their mama grieve
Bullet to the dome like an Aleve
Gotta leave for the premises, to murder my nemesis
No, no, uh, uh, just stop, stop, stop
‘Fore they even call the cops
Do it for the money and the bitches
And the drugs and the props
Tell me why another body even gotta drop
Get shot off top for some shit that was gang related
[Break: News Report Sample]
Up first at five tonight, breaking news in Gaithersburg, where a massive manhunt is underway after a deadly shooting. It's all unfolding in the 400 block of West Deer Park and 355. Our Montgomery County reporter joins us, with the latest tonight
[Verse 2]
Livin' life like this
Hope little Bobby never fight like this
Stab a motherfucker with a knife like this
All about the money on a night like this
Run up in the crib, put a bullet in your rib
Got a lot to give, but I never had the chance
Never had the chance, yeah
Stay strapped, but I hate it when I take it out
If you want it I'ma lay it out
Hope my little brother make it out
Every night what I pray about what I pray about
Check it, uh yeah, got a son on the way
But I cling to the streets even though I wanna run away
I imagine a better life
Where I never had a debt in life
Hit you with the *gunshots* in the dead of night
Sellin' crack to my own pops
Pushin' this weight on my own block
If I sell a brick I can buy a house
If they find the key they might lock me up
But I take the chance 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
Take the chance, 'cause I need that shit and don’t give a fuck
[Pause] — Get down or lay down
Hit ya with the Beretta, you better stay down
Stray shots on the playground
Livin' how I'm livin' with the life that I'm given
Anybody that’s ridin' with me, I’m ridin' with 'em
Show me the enemy, and I'ma hit 'em
The second I bit 'em, I get 'em
And hit 'em with the venom
Ain’t no need to pretend I'ma never do it
I knew it, already been through it
I do it for the street, for the fam, for the life

No, I am not an advisor, but I do advise ya
To pay attention, never need to mention

I will, I will, do it like I never done it
And I wanna run it and I wanna keep it goin' and goin'

From the start like this, from the heart like this
Finna murder it, a million miles a minute, no nitrous
Doin' righteous

Swear to God that they would but they won't

With his mans, hammer in his hands, feelin' like the man

But he was born with the white privilege!

Flashbacks of a youngin' sippin' that purple Kool-Aid
Skippin' school with my homies and chiefing reefer for two days
Running from the law, livin' how I'm livin', fuck 'em all
Bumping Triple Six
Hennessy in my cup, drivin' through the sticks
Who the bitch ridin' with me?
Man, the devil tryna get me
Motivated, under-educated, and hated
But finally gettin' cake like a happy belated
Bitch I made it, we on
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, smoke it, inhale it
Write it, record it, mix it, master it, press it up, unveil it
Feel like I've been waitin' forever, forever to inherit
This is war, I declare it
Time is money, I can't spare it
Futuristic, so simplistic
Please decipher my linguistics
Slow it down, Robitussin
I'm the king, ain't no discussion
And now we blowin' up like spontaneous human combustion
My consumption is the illest

Lemme get it right now, ho

Now they know my name through the nation
'Cause my single like that good shit, man, always in rotation
Now they know Logic for Logic, not through my affiliations
Stackin' profit on profit, from this music I'm makin'
Even Jesus had haters, so when you feelin' forsaken
Tell 'em jealous Judases who this is, and man, that'll break 'em
And bitch, I'm still the same
Dash of autotune so y'all can feel the pain

But I insist you call me back 'cause I miss you
I wish you well, well, I wish you would call
'Cause lately it feel like I’m just not yo' sister at all—all
Uh, I’m sorry for callin' and bawlin', I’m all in
And I feel like I'm fallin' lately, it feel like my children hate me
You tell me I'm beautiful and yet no man wanna date me
Haunted by vivid memories of that man who raped me
And lately I, I feel more and more like mommy, I know I’m me, but still
You always seemed to pick up the phone and somehow I feel
Better, but you been answerin' me lesser and lesser
So I resorted to the pills in my dresser, I'm gone
And as for... oh no, he left and he ain’t comin' back
I hate him and if I see him I swear I tell him that
No longer cookin' crack in my kitchen, cuttin' an' sellin' that
He broke my heart, that relationship been to hell and back
I been workin' hard, I been searchin' for God
I can feel the Devil around me as they all applaud
Promise you won't forget me, that you'll always be wit' me
And even when you gone I can call whenever he hit me
Under pressure, I've been feeling under pressure
[Verse 4]
Hey, son, this is your father, don't mean to bother
How are you? Heard you were in town, but I never saw ya
Tried to call ya, where are ya?
In Paris? What a beautiful destination
To perish right by the Eiffel, come now
Please don't be spiteful of all my small talk
I think we're overdue a long talk
When I see kids around the way, I say how I'm your dad
It gets me thinkin' 'bout incredible moments we've had
And on the real, I'm tryin' so hard not to bug you
But do you think you could stop rappin' about my drug use?
I'm two years clean, no longer a fiend
Yeah, I'm 57, but I feel 19
And I love you I swear, Bobby, I know you're there
And when the time is right I know that you gon' take care
Of anything I need, of yo' family
Can I have some tickets to your next show?
Would you stand wit' me?
Can I have some money for my new honey that's hella fine?
I forgot to mention I got divorced from yo' step-mom
My mind goin' crazy, but I still look hella calm
Maybe you could tell *beep*
I've been feelin' under pressure
[Interlude]
Hey, what's up, bro? This Ralph, I didn't want much, man, just calling to see what's going on. I know you're busy. Uh, Dad hit me up, it's his birthday today, but I know you know that. Uh, yeah, he calling, he be tryna introduce me to his new chick and stuff, man, I don't know how to handle that. I don't wanna tell him like nah, I ain't trying to meet her off top, you know? So what you think I should do? Text me, I know you're busy, dawg. But he been callin' me saying he wanna come down, he wanna bring his new chick and Brenda's like ""Damn, he really tryna rock out with his new chick"" 'cause you know we all fuck with Debbie. But I don't know, I don't know how to tell him this shit so just hit me back whenever you got the time, man, I know there's more shit on your plate. You ain't—you ain't gotta hit me, dawg, but if you do I'd appreciate it. When you back, love you, do your thing. Swag RattPack all day, boy. Alright, nigga, hit me
[Verse 5]
Uh, yeah, dear family, I'm so sorry that I've been distant
Everything changed in an instant, my time has been inconsistent
I know that you been insistin', I know that birthday I missed it
I swore I told my assistant, but I guess my mind is in another place
Thoughts off in another world, I started seein' another girl
It fell through, man, what a world
But I'm so focused on my craft, on employin' my staff
Such a perfectionist, I can't even finish this draft
This letter to the ones I love, the ones that I miss
Brothers and sisters that hit me up just to reminisce
Meanwhile, people outside of my blood askin' for favors
I don't owe you a fuckin' thing, you best switch yo' behavior
Truly remarkable how I barely know you, but somehow owe you When you don't even know 'bout the shit I go through, uh
We ain't spoken in a while, tell me sister, how yo' child?
Come now, girl, give me a smile, come on, girl, don't do me foul
Sorry I ain't call before, but I'm callin' you right now
I heard that you was poppin' E, stop resortin' to the vowel
How my mama, how she doin'? Does she know what I'm pursuin'?
I ain't talk to her in years, that relationship she ruined
But sometimes I wake up and wonder just what the fuck I'm doin'
They say family is everything, I swear that shit the truth
I should spend it all with y'all, but I spend it in the booth
This is everything I love, this is everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart it bleed
This is everything I love, everything I need
Never sacrifice this feelin' even though my heart bleed
Under pressure, I've been feelin' under pressure

[Interlude]
Hey, son, I'm sorry I missed your call today, but I was in an AA meeting. Um, a friend of mine was celebrating four years so I couldn't get you right then. And then when I did call you, you weren't able to answer or whatever. Just wonderin' how things are going. Deb and I aren't together anymore, um... Livin' on my own, you know, um... Anyway, the whole family, even the family that you don’t know, my sisters and your aunts that you've never met are very proud of you. Your cousins just love you too. Anyway, son, I love you, I just want you to know that. And just keep grindin', you know? And um, I don't wanna hear you joinin' the Illuminati 'cause then I gotta kill ya.

I can feel you in my lungs, feel you in my veins
Bloodstream only way to make it to my brain
I tried some others but man they just not as good as you
Going crazy 'cause I only feel this good with you
Maybe I'm just not as strong as I once was
When we're together lately I don't even feel a buzz
I'm addicted to this shit like it was hard drugs (Drugs)
Nikki baby, I love you but now I gotta go
'Cause in the end what happens you already know
Probably wonder where I been at, I been laying low
But in my mind I'm wondering what I'm paying for (Paying for)
All these other bitches on my dick but I can't fuck with that
You're the only girl I need I gotta have you back
Even though you turn my lungs black (My lungs black)
Tell me where you been Jack (Been Jack)
Uh, I know this shorty that go by the name of Mary
I used to fuck her way back when I didn't know a thing
Skipping school with all my homies on some truancy
But when I ended things with her it was just you and me
Doing me good, that's what I thought at first
Me and you together, swear to God that's all that worked
Away from you though man it's just so hard to work (Hard to work)
Uh, my heart is hard at work
We been together like ten years
Goddamn, took me as a young man
Everyday I wonder who I am, who will I be, where will I go
What will they write upon my grave?
A free man born as a king, who died as a slave
But everything he gave her was for nothing though
Oh no I can't fade that shit I gotta let you go
You got me tripping like a flight to Vegas
All this shit you got me doing man it's outrageous
All I know is I'm living the life I never would
Finally let you go, I thought I never could
Don't get me wrong, can't forget the times shared
Seem like everywhere I go, I always know you're there
Tried to run but my legs won't
I look away but my head don't
I love it when you're fresh
I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath
I hate it that I need you, Nikki
But I love it when I feed you, Nikki
I hate that I bleed for you
Uh, I long and I need for you
But I love it when I taste you (Taste you)
Nothing can replace you (Replace you)
I wish I could erase you, you’re everywhere I go
But you're everywhere I long to be
And all these other people that don't seem to understand
I'm just a man they always ask what’s wrong with me
Man you're everything I crave
You're the only thing I let in that would put me in the grave
I'm a king, you're my Coretta
But lately, I been feeling like a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)

Slave for the—
Said, I'm a slave for the nicotine (Nicotine, nicotine)
Been a slave for ya

I ain’t here to pick and choose
I ain't here to sing the blues
I’m just here to spread the clues
I’m just here to spread the news
Everybody know I do
Listen
I ain’t ashamed to be white
I ain’t ashamed to be Black
I ain’t ashamed of my beautiful Mexican wife as a matter of fact
I know you fucking with that
And I’m not scared of the people who tell me I should be
Do what you love and don’t ever wonder what it could be
Everybody from my hood, everybody know I’m good
Sometimes I’m misunderstood
But that's just the uneducated that never related and feel like I'm fading off
They feel like I'm fading
I'm right out my mind
Tell 'em!
Momma don't love me
Daddy don't love me
Wonder why I drown in the bubbly
You could be anything you wanna be
'Cept the person you don’t wanna be
Let him hate let em love
Wondering if everybody still like this up above
When that push come to shove
Make me wanna pull up with the, with the gat in the glove like
I just wanna be free
Not a slave to the stereotype
All alone in my room in the middle of the night
I don’t have the words but my stereo might
I don't wanna be black, I don’t wanna be white, I just wanna be a man today
I don't wanna be a Christian, Muslim, gay, straight, or bi, see you later, bye
Not perceived by the things I believe or the color of my skin
Or the fact I’m attracted to her, maybe him
Or the fact I’m a single mother living all alone
Looking for a man and a home to call my own
But I already have one
The only man I’ma ever need is my son, my son, my son, my son
Son, say:
Black is beautiful
Be black and proud
Fuck everybody hatin' on me right now, I’m black and proud
I’m just as white as that Mona Lisa
I’m just as black as my cousin Keisha
I’m biracial so bye Felicia
Praise Black Jesus now call the preacher
Maybe Jesus was black

Blowin' up like a Molotov

Got Champagne problems, and I order more

Fuck around wanna fight like this, take a hike like this

Reinvention, that's my intention
Want so much more than this third-dimension
That's not to mention my true ascension is a bigger picture
No metaphor, I’m being real with ya
But it will hit ya like, ""goddamn!""
Going HAM, full of all of them
In a spaceship, I’m in another system
So futuristic, on another mission
But back on Earth everybody bitchin', I been in the kitchen
Livin' my life—no inhibition, life to death with no intermission
Now the good book said we all the same, and we kill each other but it's all in vain
And we all to blame, can't see the picture when it's out the frame
Real talk, I wanna grip the grain and just ride with ya, build a family then die richer
When ya get to heaven I'ma come and get ya
Sit back and really get the picture
This life, yeah, it done ate away, hard times never stayed away
But one thing I know day to day, I'ma do somethin' 'fore I fade away

(Walk with your tap)

[Verse]
Yeah, in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
Shit is too big, but let's be honest man, it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
'Cause people don't buy music in this day and age, they buy the brand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God, he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

Alright
Seen a lot of shit, yeah
Seen a lot of shit

[Verse 1]
I've seen a lot of shit I shouldn't have but never forgot it though
Brothers on the corner selling crack like it was nada though
Walk inside my kitchen baking soda all up on the floor
Police banging on the door while gripping a .44
I was just a youngin' but this type of shit I've seen before
Y'all see a white boy, but my daddy a negro
Half breed motherfucker grip the mic and he flow
I just wanna spread love, they want me to bleed slow
I just wanna keep the peace and help people
Give some of this money that I'm making to the people
So if you hatin' on me goddamn, you evil
And just don't understand 'cause I'm flyer than Knievel
Been through a lot of shit but I keep it on the D-Lo
Never bustin' in 'em streets but I keep it G though
I ain't into fairy tales, I'm just me, ho!
Only thing I talk about is everything that we know
I heard you got a fucking problem, bitch, I bet I beast
Ain't no need to reach, I don't need a piece
I just kill 'em with kindness, yeah, we leave ‘em deceased
And tell it like it is so now you got it, capiche? Homie, what up?
[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down

[Verse 2]
I hope you live a long life hatin'
Now watch every Grammy just to see who they nominating, uh
So successful they probably say I signed with Satan
But I got God on my side, always down to ride
Don't get it twisted, I ain't perfect in the least
I'm still all up in your girl jeans like a crease
Matter fact like a geneticist
These rappers' records comin' out, they so repetitive
Shout out my homie Chance, peace to Skizzy Mars
RattPack, homie Castro, we dropping bars
It's all love, man that shit is ours
They never thought I'd make it, shooting for the stars
Yeah, I'm a born sinner, but it's a Cole world
Shout out my homies that know me, can't forget my old girl
But that's a touchy subject like a priest, whoa
I heard y'all finally eating over there, we got a feast, though
Keep it RattPack 'til the beat go
You might not get the flow now, let it seep though
Fans know my lyrics deeper than the sea floor
But we dumb it down so they spin it on the radio
Racism all up in 'em, that shit is irrelevant
My flow is colorblind, rapping for the hell of it
I don't give a fuck, my mind-state celibate
Run quick, tell a bitch, rap getting me hella rich
Out the blue like Ella Fitz, my flow is so elegant
Death before dishonor, murderin' rappers in front of they mama's
I rep Artanis, decipher the word 'cause it's ebonics
Reverse the letters and it spells Sinatra, yes, I gotcha, bitch it's Logic
[Chorus]
Let me bring it back down
They think it's a game right now (Yeah)
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now (Yeah)
Back where I came from now
We gon' live it up 'til we bring it back down
They think it's a game right now
But it ain't the same right now, know my name right now

They can't leave us hangin', no, no, not no more, best believe
Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves
Get it done, yeah, I get it done, no blood on the leaves

[Verse 1]
At the Garden, sitting courtside, look around like, ""Oh my God""
I just sold this motherfucker out, I ain't even try
I ain't one to floss, but I got plaques, run it back
Once I touch down, I go deep like a running back
Just jumped on the private jet and rolled a joint
Played the beat then wrote that joint
Wrote a whole movie, then I sold that joint
Fuck Illuminati, that boy 6ix got my back
6ix made this beat, 6ix bring the heat you got on repeat
Word on the street
Can't no one compete, I'm spectacular
That boy got the sauce on the RAGÚ-lar
I don't play no games 'less we talkin' Fortnite
Finally knew I made it, sittin' at the red light
When them soccer moms pull up in they van while I ride
Like, ""Oh my God, children, it's the 1-800 guy""
But my doors suicide, yeah, I'm too alive
Bitch, I have arrived, everybody know I'm one hell of a guy
I ain't tryna fuck your girl, I'm tryna fuck your mama
Fuck the drama, bank account got a extra comma
Yeah, they sweat me like the sauna
Red carpet in my own merch, like that shit is designer
Did you know I'm mixed like Obama?
It ain't a project if Logic ain't talkin' 'bout being biracial
Bicoastal, I'm platinum, go postal, I'm snappin'
Yeah, you know Bobby, but prolly' only know my new shit
That trap shit, that cool shit, but they all know that fool spit

Yeah, that shit is banging, Bobby killed it with no time to grieve, ayy

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you know you made it when they make a meme for ya
Haters that never made it, I'm livin' the dream for ya
Roll up, grab the kush and then roll up
Hold up, better give me what I want when I show up
You know what I do, not who coming through
How 'bout you?
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool
I don't fuck with nobody like mean girls in high school
I don't give a damn that I'm famous
Why it seem like every single celebrity shameless, it's dangerous
Got 50 million but my swag on food stamps
All these models poppin' bottles, bitch, I ain't tryna dance
She said, ""No, I don't wanna pay my bills""
I need a hard workin' woman with respect who will
This for everybody who ain't made it yet
Got five degrees and six figures in debt
Follow your dreams ho, follow your— follow your—, uh
Somebody calling your, uh, it's destiny
Hold up with the turn up for a second man, who's testing me?
I got so much power, don't know why the heavens blessing me
PLP, I think that is the recipe
So I'ma take a moment, use my power for good
Fuck the bullshit, do what you love and get out the hood
[Chorus]
I'm the one, bitch, I am the one, like Keanu Reeves

Okay

We call that ballin', doin' this is my callin'
Flow is so appallin', my phone off and she callin', I'm like, ""Yeah
What it do?"" Penthouse, man, what a view
Fall back, 'cause I'm coming through with my whole team, they coming too
That's real, too real, motherfucker, tell me how you feel
I'm too good for my own good, I won't leak the album, I'll let it spill
Number one, bitch, I bet it will, do the numbers I said it will
I played the game and I'm still the same and I never changed just to get a deal

[Chorus: Logic]
Bitch, I'm ballin'
Ballin', I came from nuttin' to somethin'
Like it's nuttin', yeah, you know I done it, now there's no discussion
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', I made a promise to my mama
I'ma turn these zeros into tens and commas
Bitch, I'm ballin', ballin', closin' million dollar deals
Catch me swervin', burning hundred dollar bills, how it feel
When you ballin', ballin', goin' places they never go
It ain't all about the money, but I stack it 'cause you never know

I'ma live life 'til I overdose while they sleepin' on me, that's comatose

And your next girl is my ex-girl, she fine as hell, but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme, I got no time, so I can't reply to your text, girl

Gon' get it, I'm feelin' myself, fresh to death, bitch, I'm killin' myself; I'm gone
We burnin' it up, step in the building, we turnin' it up
Talkin' that shit, but they never admit when I step to the mic I be murderin' it

You would think we held an election

Never seen a nigga with a bitch that's finer

Ugh, yeah
My name is Logic, if you don't know by now, I'm always on my grind
And at this moment in time, I’m on a road when I write this rhyme
Sitting behind Raheem Devaughn while he’s passed out
'Bout to hit the station 'fore our gas is out
Look outside the window, I see shorties with they asses out, oh my
Good god, you know we fly
Day dreaming out the window, watch how buildings pass me by
See I ain’t signed but at this point in time
I'm feeling like the 3-6-8th
Wonder of the world, just might steal your girl
All I do is rhyme and get money, that’s my repertoire
Holla at honeys, ""Voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?""
Baby what’s the deal, have you ever heard of some shit so real?

Ever since I was a youngin I knew I’d break in the game
While you worshiped other rappers that leave you less entertained

Searching for wisdom in women but only getting brain

Unless you do me foul like a free throw, then we finito

Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with legends
Crazy how one day yo' idols can turn into your brethren
Bitches we severin', hit up my jeweler, watch him freeze us
Breaking bread like I'm Jesus, money ain't everything, but somehow eases
Better believe than think down and leave us
The baby cryin'
Crack cookin' where my sister be fryin' soul food
Plus my other sister just went back to her old dude
He whoopin' her ass—I'll kill him, I'll kill him
I'll motherfuckin' kill him, I said, I really want to kill him—but I can't
'Cause if I do, po-po gon' claim I'm the villain, but I ain't
See my vision from pictures I paint
Do you feel it like I feel it? I grip the mic and then kill it—okay, I'm gone
As memories resurface from hella long in my past
Chillin', sippin' Sinatra from a flask
Little Bobby, just a youngin', skating was my hobby
Tryna stay out of trouble, my homie in jail for robbery
Welfare, food stamps, and stealing from the sto'
Come home and see an eviction notice taped to my do'
Can't take no mo', mama on drugs, daddy M.I.A
What can I say? I just wanted to be a kid and play
To this day, I pay homage to the gods, to the greats
Never stolen, I'm from Maryland
Where they shoot you in the dark of the night
Like Christopher Nolan, for talking outta your colon
Catch me rollin' with the realest
Lyricism the illest, my chain is the chillest, Sub Zero
Far from a hero, bitch, I'm De Niro in Goodfellas
If your bitch around me, best bring an umbrella
Let me tap into my inner southern killer, none other illa
Murder the game and then resurrect it like ""Thriller""
Yeah, my skin is vanilla, but bitch I dare ya to test my killa
We don't do it for the skrilla, we do it for love
Word to my homies up above, we slingin' like drugs
And overdose 'em like the dealer does (Logic)

Yes, I know the flow hotter than Lucifer, even though heaven sent him, uh
[Verse 2]
See my vision as I've elevated and risen
Open your eyes, despise lies told with deadly precision
I finally made my way up out that section 8 division
Not by busting and killing though I've had my share of stealin'
But by putting pen to this pad and dispersin' these feelings
While the label only care about making a killin'
Feel my energy—I ain't talking E-N-E-R-G-Y, I mean inner G
That's the shit they never see
But I own supremacy, number one—I better be
Bitch, I said, ""I bet I be.""
Take my kindness for weakness, trying to get the better of me
Tell me, how is they gon' remember me?
As the artist that concocted the perfect recipe?
Or will they be addressing me, talking less of me
Just 'cause I was different
Just 'cause I was doing what I love?
And the fans say they love you, but they push and they shove
'Cause they want what they want how they want when they want it
I just gave them twenty songs, now they want another hunnid
I just see it as a challenge, I could do it, bitch, I run it
Worldwide tours, type of shit I always wanted
While the rest of 'em just worry 'bout bitches and gettin' blunted
Still that same motherfucker from that YS1
Only difference: I'm stronger and better from when I begun
So when people that never knew me, they tell me that I changed
That my music is different and my vision's rearranged, I just stop (I just stop)
And do my best to refrain
From having conversations with people that ain't in my lane
Will I die? (Will I die?) Will I live?
Give the world everything I have to give
This is feelings on the page, know my wisdom, not my age
Understand that I'm a man not defined by his wage
Even though it's in the millions, that shit don't define my brilliance
Open your mind and maybe you can see the billions
Of people that separated, but all equal
To know the ending, one must understand the prequel, uh

I can't get no better, can’t get no more cheddar
I feel like a king and my queen is Coretta
I been made a livin', I'm never gon’ give in
I'm just way too driven, that's why I been thinkin'
I'm scared that I'm sinkin', I'm scared that I’m fallin’
The world think I'm ballin’ and maybe I am
But don't give a damn, back in the beginnin'
Did not have a plan, don't know who I am
Or who I’m becomin' but I'ma do me to the fullest, alright
Bustin' and dodgin' them bullets all night
Take over the world, yeah I'm thinkin' I might
Got 'em all in my sight
I know that I'm strong, I know that I am
I know I'm the man
And whether you poor or you filled with financial security
Everyone deal with they own insecurity
Even the preacher was born with impurity
Scared to go out even with my security
Scared of the world and all of its obscurity
Pray for maturity, hope that I grow
Hope my anxiety stay on the low
I swear I hope that shit don't fuck up my flow
Where do I go? What would you do
If suddenly all of your dreams came true?
What would you do if you did it all?
If you ain't never have to lift a finger
Would you linger like, ""Fuck 'em all""?
Guess that's your call, but I can't
This a marathon, not a sprint
Switch up the plan like homie that went from Verizon to Sprint
Can you hear me now? Does anybody out there feel me now?
[Chorus]
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know
What's your name? What's your game?
Come now, boy, just spit your flow
Feel the pain with the gain, what you tryna say though?
Novocaine to the brain, I can't feel nothing no mo'
In my lane, can't refrain from lettin' these people know

How I feel (How I feel), yeah that's how I feel (That's how I feel)
Break it down, roll it up, that's how high I feel (That's how high I feel)
How I feel (How I feel), how high I feel (How high I feel)
Down, roll it up, yeah

[Verse 2]
Searchin' for bliss only led me to searchin' for hits
Only led me to battle depression
I done learned my lesson 'cause fame never lessen the pain
What if your life was under a glass?
And people tried to dig up shit from your past
And tell you what's good and what's not
And every time you drop a song, they say that it's wack or it's hot
And don't give a damn that it came from the heart
They tear it apart like hyenas, this here for the dreamers
This here for the people that know what I'm sayin'
All of the people that know what I'm sayin'
Fuck social media
Tellin' me who I should be and just how I should rap
They always compare, they always compare me to others
And try to hit me up against all my brothers
Now, why you think so many rappers be overdosin' at the crib?
(Overdosin' at the crib)
'Cause people just won't let 'em live
And the public is constantly thinkin' they know 'em
But nobody knowin' what's goin' on inside
And they wonder why we all hide, shit
Maybe I'm just overthinkin'
Or maybe I'm just over-smokin' and drinkin'
And when I can't deal with the hate, I self-medicate
Sit in the corner and think of a better day
Maybe this bullet can help me to get away
I just cannot seem to think of a better way
Even though I know there is, that's why I keep goin'
That's why I keep flowin', that's why I keep perserverin'
Even when I'm hearin' I'm a bitch, I'm a fag
I'm a motherfuckin' hypebeast, I ain't black in the slight least
I ain't good enough, I should quit, I should kill myself (Kill myself)
'Cause ""you'll never be Kenny""
""You'll never be better than Drizzy or Cole""
""You're losing your hair, you're too fucking old,"" yeah
These are the comments I'm readin' on Twitter right now
That make me depressed and they pullin' me down
I'm tryin' to swim but I think I'ma drown
So I'ma turn that feelin' into a sound
And play it when nobody else is around
Whenever I feel like I'm far from the ground
God, give me the power to battle depression
Yeah, round after round
I wish I was famous, I wish I was rich
I wish I could just get up out of this bitch
But be careful what you wish for
'Cause it ain't everything that it's cut out to be
My life is good but not as good as it's 'bout to be
'Cause I got vision, don't fuck with division
Ain't God, but I'm rich and I think that I am
Do what you love and do not give a damn
Fuck all the haters you see on the 'Gram
Just mind your own business and be a good man
Be a good boss and be a good friend
Spread your imagination to the millions
Don't worry 'bout how to maintain all your millions
Just spread that positivity for the children
And all the haters that's hatin', just love 'em
'Cause that's the only way you ever gon' kill 'em
Know somebody feel 'em
Last but not least, put your ego on the shelf
And remember, love yourself
Nah, nah, nah
Put your ego on the shelf and love yourself
Nah, nah, nah

Yeah yeah, what up Bobby
Like goddamn, like goddamn
This that 9-5 shit right here
Take 'em back to the 90s!
Like goddamn, like goddamn
Yo yo yo yo yo, yo yo yo

[Verse 1: Logic]
Okay now take a trip inside my mind like you was off to Venice
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
Take 'em back to way back when, like Dennis the Menace
Causin' mayhem on the come up like a young apprentice
Smokin' weed and gettin' higher than a flight attendant
Hip-hop descendant, gold Jesus on my pendant
Got to pull it out for everyone that's in attendance
Okay, back in the day as a College Park tenant
Still can't believe I didn't get a shorty pregnant
Man, that's the definition of a life sentence
A whole lot of beef, no bread, no lettuce
'Cause I couldn't keep it in my briefs, man that's pathetic
Fuck all that back and forth, this ain't a game of tennis
I'll be in my mothafuckin' chamber like the senate
Scared to go outside but I know I can't prevent it
I'm, forever alone in my mind (Yeah yeah)
See I'm a self-diagnosed hypochondriac
Either at the crib, or on the tour bus is where you'll find me at
Yeah, I know that I'm livin' like I got it okay, yeah
But I swear that I'm not that neurotic over here, yeah
[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here

[Verse 2: Big Lenbo & Logic]
Ayo, fuck all that, it's the fat young Jesus; flow prestigious
Stackin' money and playin' the field man like Regis
Better believe us or leave us
Grabbin' your bitch's cleavage like, ""woo-hah""
I went from surveyin' to Super Saiyan slayin' the man
Bitches want an autograph
I sign them titties in crayon, like goddamn!
It's me and B-I-G L-N-B-O cookin' like chemists
It's me and B-I, B-I, B-I-G L-N-B-O, L-N-B-O
Posted in the club in baggy jeans and a beanie
Sippin' on a martini, takin' my pick at bitches like eenie meenie
I'm unscannable, young cannibal, eat wack MCs like Hannibal
'Cause Joe Pesci's my spirit animal

[Hook: Logic]
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
Over here, over here
[Verse 3: Logic & Big Lenbo]
Okay the flow delicious, bounty huntin' like Sid Vicious
The young Spiegel, interstellar with my retrieval
Furthest from evil, I throw this shit back like medieval
I spit at it like a Beretta
You know I get better by givin' the people
Not a fuck given, check the method, that's how we livin'
Always been driven, out of sight and yet never hidden
""The Return of the Jedi""
Bitch I bet I do the show and catch a red eye
Ho I said I leave 'em dead, I know I do
This shit is (overdue, pass me the fifth and I'm comin' through)
The B-I-G L-E-N-B-O on the way to Rio
Ay dios mio, lookin' for a Latin Leo
To hold a brother down like the white man
Fuck that nigga
Ayo enough's enough, man of my word, I never bluff
Even in a pair of cuffs, know we always keep it real
Like goddamn, don't even step like I ain't the man
I'm just (301 reppin', second I step in Maryland)
I gotta conceal it like a murder weapon
I kept in the glove, Ratt Pack you know it's all love
We the realest so fuck you if you ain't feel this
Throw a Molotov in your crib
And tell them bitches to bill us, we the illest
Finger fuck a critic
Shit is darker than ""The Chronicles of Riddick""
Yes I did it, while they bit it, you know we got it
Smack you with the palm, save the back for your mom
Sound the alarm, you know we got it goin' on121Embed"

I feel the Aryan in my blood, it's scarier than a Blood
Been looking for holy water, now I’m praying for a flood
It feel like time passing me by slower than a slug
While this feeling inside of my body seep in like a drug
Will you hug me, rub me on the back like a child?
Tell me you love me, need me
Promise me you’ll never leave me
Even though my daddy, you know he blacker than the street
With a fist to match, more solid than concrete
Tell white people I’m black, feel the need to retreat
Like I should be ashamed of my granddaddy Malik
But my beautiful black brothers and sisters
Want to act like I’m adopted
Go back in time to when my nigga daddy
Impregnated my cracker momma and stopped it

[Refrain: Logic]
My oh my (My oh my)
Oh my (My oh my)
I said oh my (Oh my)

[Verse 2: Logic]
Somebody pinch me
Black man screaming, trying to convince me I’m not black
So why the white man wanna lynch me?
Damn, my skin fair but life’s not
And I'd be lying if I said I didn’t care what whites thought
Or black people said, shit
Maybe it’s in my head
Like a single mother praying In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida
Looking around on the ground for a serpent to feed her
Praying to God, wondering why her baby daddy beat her
Feeling like the devil finna come and defeat her
All alone in the wintertime, close to the heater
Wondering what’s gonna happen
And how the world gonna treat her
How could her momma mislead her
And her daddy just leave her?
Like abracadabra when that magician pull on the lever

(Oh my) Oh my

Oh my, my, my, my, my

Feeling like I need to hide
Everybody wonder why I get high
'Cause I can’t fight the feeling inside
Oh my, my, my
Oh my, I said oh my, yeah

[Verse 3: Logic]
Feeling innocent in a sense has got me feeling on the fence
And all this shit is so intense
Don’t wanna go to this event
Just wanna stay home and invent
And somehow, yeah, that let me vent
I’m taking shots and drinking liquor
But that shit don’t make a dent in how I’m feeling
And yes I’m willing to keep chilling on this shit
I know there's someone out there far away
Who's feeling all this shit
And yes I know that when I’m low
There's so much further I can go
And so I look up to the sky
Oh my, oh my

Atom: So what now? What advice can you give me?
God: What advice can I give humanity?
Atom: I suppose so
God: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all
Kai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever
Thomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour
Kai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?
Thomas: Oh no, man. I’m cueing up the fourth album now, his final one
[Outro: J. Cole]
One, two, three, four
One, two, three, four, listen
Look into my eyes
Tell me you could see beyond the smile that I'm puttin' on
This front that I'm puttin' up for you
I spill my soul into a microphone
With poems written in blood
In hopes that it's enough for you
Do you love me yet?
Do you love me yet?
No? Okay
I'll go harder for you
In fact, I rap till I collapse
All I wanted was acceptance, my latest lesson
I'll never feel your approval till I accept my own
Come from a messed up home, destitute and less informed
About the ways to raise a child up
To not become a product
Of his environment, I need to cry and vent
But I done built this wall up
Actin' like everything's all good
But in reality I'm lookin' for something
Through bumpin' my favorite rappers I came up after
Nas, Cole, and Hov
Eyes closed, I zone till five or so in the morn'
I'm used to being alone
Shit, you know how long I've been out on my own?
Chasing dreams, fantasies of a throne
One day I wake up and see that it didn't exist all along
Till then I will pen verses that fans consider brilliant
Boosting my ego with every million that spills in
And still then
I won't find solace, so where's the logic in that?
Worrying 'bout if they think Logic can rap
When it all just goes back to a childhood, need to be loved
By parents that was in too deep with the drugs
Nigga, my advice, fuck the black and white shit
Be who you are, identify as a star
No one tells you you're that
It's something that you just know
The world be stealing your glow
Your mama did what she could
Her life was miles from good
Your father fell in the trap
They set for you when you black
They met when they was low
And therefore you a product of that
And so your trauma is deep
Don't bury it you should weep
And clean it out of your system, then truly forgive 'em
Just my opinion, only then can you find peace
Just start to notice happiness don't come from album release
I've been through it before
Can only share with you what I know
To be true, but at the same time, I'll never be you
And you'll never be me, no matter how hard that you try
This is for youngins out there wondering how far you can fly
The truth is that you could go further than the stars and the sky
But if you want to then you ought to know why
Are you running from something
With hopes of becoming someone
That's finally worthy of love
Let me tell you now, you're worthy enough
Fuck approval from strangers, that shit is dangerous as hell
Find God, learn to accept yourself
And I'm gone, acceptance64Embed"

Take a trip, little trip, life is what you make of it (Yeah-yeah)
I've been focused on this music, can't fuck with no basic bitch
Let me switch, the flow up, the flow up a little bit (Yeah-yeah)
No I ain't just tryna hit, hit, get with this (Nah, nah)
Bounce if you really 'bout it, but I doubt it, yes I do (If you 'bout it)
Seems like all this new shit really just leftover residue
I'm coming through, if I see your bitch I bet she coming too

Coast to coast, nationwide tour, then we hit the world
Rub a dub, if your bitch bad, we might hit your girl
RattPack, know the deal
What's the motto? Keep it real!
(I know) I got it, I want it, I need it
We live in an era where they get deleted
I'm wondering if I'ma make it
Man fuck it, I'll take it, that record I'll break it
These bitches they love it, but I never covet
I just keep it going, that's why I be flowin'
I'm already knowing this life that I'm livin'
Don't know what I'm given
It's so hard not to give in

Do you really wanna be a superstar?
Do you really wanna get dangerous?
Do you even know where the groupies are?

Everything happens for a reason
Happens for a reason
People only in your life for seasons
Word to Aunt Viv (Real shit)
Uh, death and taxes that’s all we given
You can make a life but can’t make a livin'
You can make it work but that still ain't driven
Give a lot but that still ain't givin'
Livin' life like this ain’t real though
Every night like this I feel so dead wrong
Collision is head on, my vision is dead and gone
Perception of right and wrong
I been here so very long right here in this very song, uh
Look around everything changes
Seem like everybody just strangers
Don’t go outside 'cause it’s dangerous
Why everybody wanna be famous
I’m so OCD, if they notice me
I might jump out the grave so they know it’s me
Man, everybody want this shit for free
Hand out, palm up when they get to me
In my mind, no, I never let it get to me
Everybody got a time, will it get to me?

Tell me why what I’m doing ain’t shit to me, damn

Every time that I’m willing I feel like I'm killin' my dreams
When that voice goes nah, nah, nah
Listen up now, love it or hate it
Never debate it, you can never degrade it
While all these other motherfuckers
Probably thinking I made it
My mind jaded, no—I never evade it
I elevate it just to keep it innovative (innovative)
God damn, bring it back now, blowin' up like Iraq now

No, we never back down
Just take my time, I just take my time

So everyone know that I did it like this
Yeah, I know—I'ma take my time

Why nowadays everybody got a palm out?

'Bout to take it back like Doc and Marty inside the DeLorean
I am no historian, but here to make my predecessors proud
All you bitch niggas not allowed?

More than likely they ain't got the heart to fight me

Got some niggas alive, I got some niggas that not
Pour a little of brown liquor and look in the sky
Been the talk of the town, nigga, Virginia, Maryland
Did it all for the capital, hope you haven't forgot
Hoes love me a lot, niggas hate me a lil
Anybody can hear me for real give me they props
Hookin' up with a couple models, nobody's gon' try to play us
The motto is get your paper and make you a lot
Pulling up with the Young Sinatra, I'm looking like Sammy Davis
The MGM or the Vegas to shake up the rocks
And the Stadium poppin', the Palladium poppin'
It's a fifty a place nigga, she thinkin' about it
I'll be damned
[Chorus: John Lindahl & Logic]
And it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no (I'll be damned)
I said it's on now
Everybody know that it's on now (I'll be damned)
Ohh, get in the zone now
Ohh, no, no, no

[Post-Chorus: Logic & John Lindahl]
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
Everybody alive, everybody alive
Everybody that's listening to this feeling alive
Come on now feel the vibe, come on now feel the vibe
Come on now, come on now, come on now, you gotta survive
I said you gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive
Gotta survive, gotta survive
Gotta survive, I said you gotta survive

Uh, woo, goddammit, I'm back at it
Never out of breath like an asthmatic, I done had it
For this shit, I'm an addict, back in Maryland livin' in the attic
Flowin' erratic, bringin' the static, bustin' like an automatic
I'm badder than the baddest and madder than the maddest
My flow the fattest, hotter than a desert in Nevada
None of the badder, fuck all the chitter and chatter, none of it matter
Pull the trigger and listen to the pitter and patter, let 'em shatter
'Cause I'm rippin' and livin' and strivin', the killer

Daddy graduated from Cambridge, yeah, money talks in every language, huh
Real recognize that stainless (stainless), silver spoon what my aim is
Y'all don't know what that game is
Man, y'all don't know what that, uh
Y'all 'bout that fraternity life
If you're from where I'm from then as soon as you come
Baby girl gon' be 'bout that maternity life
If you do like my daddy, then she gonna be single and alone
That maternity life for eternity life
Eternity life probably thinking we livin' that life
Cause we do what we do, but hold up let me get it right
Everybody got problems, everybody got problems
But not everybody need a .45 to solve them, revolve them (ba-ba-ba-ba)
Take care of all of them like this, I might just go crazy all the way
Y'all live that life where your safety is only a call away
But not us, mommy and daddy never bought us
Not a god damn thing but they brought us
Broke as hell we couldn't fund the trust
Outside run around with a gun to bust
Police looking for every one of us
Back then, yeah, all of that was fun to us
Had a little bit of money in the middle, let me hit 'em with a riddle
If I never had a dark night I might not-not-not—
Not be the same—might not be the—

You don't know nothing about this, right here boy

Get the fuck up off your silver-
[Verse 2: Logic]
Everybody wanna live lavish, a million in the bank on average
They cutthroat, yeah they savage
They riding round with the baddest (bitch)
One day I woke up, and said I'm bout to do this
For the rest of my life, no question it's right
Waiting for the bus at a stop light
Looking at the cop right in front of my eyes
Living in a world of lies, where the truth dies
And hatred multiplies—mu-mu-mu-multi—
Multiplies, I said I can't take it
I remember wondering if I would ever make it
But as I reminisce I realise it was all irrelevant, it's evident
I'm getting money for the hell of it
Never fuck around, so the flow celibate
Speaking for the people like a delegate
And when the situation delicate
I execute it with the proper etiquette
Everybody wanna get ahead of it, no, can't take the time to stop
It ain't all about the money so I'm headed to the top
But I'm still getting guap, never stop unless a body drop
Metaphorical motherfucker to get it in
While the whole world spin for the dividend
But I'm in another system
Everybody hate till he dead then they miss 'em
Why can't we relax and listen?
Stop spending money on things that glisten

It's the type of shit that they read about
Like Chris said, I gotta bleed it out
I've been in the zone, I can't be without
This real shit that I be about
I'm a visionary, that's long term
But Def Jam, said they need it out
If I rush this shit, I might be without
But I need a vision, can't see without
I've been patient, never complacent
Left the underground when I left the basement
That's renovation, I spit this verse like a revelation
On the road with Kid Cudi and B-I-G
Conversations with No I.D
Who made hits with Ye, got hits with JAY
Now he wanna fuck around and make hits with me
If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be
Can't express what that meant to me, what it mean to me
Man, I swear the shit like a dream to me, what it seemed to be
It's so different now, everything is so different now
I've been there and I've done that
Tell 'em all that I run that, that's a fun fact
And I'm back again cause I love this shit
Write it down and they publish it
I went 5 years without a publicist
'Cause the word of mouth, they in love with this
I've been dreaming, I've been scheming
Went away a while but I've been fiending
I've missed the fam, but they know the deal
Been at it way before the deal
Now the  music got mass appeal
My main girl got ass appeal
Like I feel the vibe, that's the main thing
Little fish, that went mainstream
Now I'm big as fuck
My whole city, they know what's up
I'm unseen and I'm in the cut about extra shit
I don't give a fuck
When I'm on the phone, don't interrupt
If I'm talking business, I might erupt
If you're at the show, put your lighter up
Fuck with me if you're really 'bout it
Outsiders, I could do without it
I crept in, got slept on
Sold out shows, no one knew about it
When it comes to fucks, I give two about it
Your cosign, I could do without it
[Interlude: Dria]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na
[Verse 2]
Okay, last verse I gotta make it count
Won't speak on my bank account
So many commas I'd have to pause
And I can't afford to just waste the bars
Every day, boy, I thank the Lord
I got a lot of problems but could have more
Wish I spoke to my dad more, my jeweler less
I been hungry like Budapest
Tell me who the best, don't give a fuck
I just know I'm blessed
Love life even though I'm stressed
This business boy, I swear a test
Tell Def Jam if they don't cut the check
I'll send Chris to go cut they neck
I love the building, no disrespect
But y'all better ride when I'm in effect
That's radio, that's TV, but Visionary got the internet
If y'all fuck around or try to throw the ball to another artist
I'ma intercept, It's my time
Put half a mil' of my own money in this album
That's my dime; no rap features, just my rhymes
My story, it's all mine, from the basement to the stadium
From the Roxy to Palladium
I've been there and I've done that, yes I run that
With this pretty girl on my floor
Half naked playing Connect Four
But I've been trying to throw sex out the window
Just to connect more
She so fine, type of girl I wanna fuck her mind
And then unwind with some slow head
All my homies like, ""go 'head""
Anyway, it's been a long time
And this here has been a long rhyme, so I gotta go
It's Logic, the one nobody would vouch for
How's that shit for an outro?
[Interlude: Dria]
Na, na, na, na, na, na

Oh shit, I might need an IV, permanently, permanently
Ayy, Goddamn, these bitches is thirsty
They see a rapper but they ignore the band
I ain't talkin' 'bout musicians, you stupid bitch
Talkin' 'bout what's on my hand

Sold millions of records before the radio

They can never bear me, just the homies and me
Now we the Grammy family
You made a couple million, that shit is gross
My net is 30, my record clean, my flow is dirty, right?
Real G's move in silence like—
Who the common denominator?
Fuck around and bomb a hater
My flow greater, heart darker than Darth Vader
Check the data, matter of fact, check the state of mind
After I'm finished, these rappers ain't in a state to rhyme
Straight to your mind now
Feel this shit like it's some Braille
Way too heavy for the scale
All I know about is bars, like I couldn't make the bail
It ain't never room to fail
Only growing and prevail
When my anxiety rise and I feel like I'm in hell
Take a moment and inhale
Count to five then exhale
Then we run that motherfucker like a marathon
Hits, motherfucker, hits, yeah we 'bout that Barry Bonds
Brace yourself, you can't retain me
All that shit you talkin' out your mouth just won't sustain me

Spit it with venom
Never pretend to be somethin' that I'm not
And you ain't shit when you stand next to me
No kiddin' like vasectomy
Step to me, throw disrespect to me
And I'll rearrange your trajectory
Black and white like a piano and I'm proud to be
And fuck whoever tell me I am not allowed to be
I am me, I'm a man, can I live?—Goddamn
Yeah, I guess this shit right here is just all a part of the plan

Sometimes I feel like I've drifted, I feel different I feel gifted
I've been high so long, don't need to smoke to get lifted
I've been under pressure looking for Nikki
Whenever she is around, you know I come quickly
Vivid memories of Chicago, south side where I go
From Reggies to the House of Blues, progress is the motto
Man the first show that I ever done sold out was in Chicago
Yeah, yeah, living like I've been ready to die
Maybe not, I don't know why my mind is changing
Rearranging this dangerous melody, uh
Yeah, and I know that ain't nobody finna ever be ahead of me
All that competition right there is dead to me
Yeah, uh, yeah, I've been turning the pages
Feeling the vibe, shit is outrageous
Boy, I've been feeling courageous
This shit right here, I've been at it for ages
Feels like I'm running through mazes
Everybody has they phases
Yeah, vibe with this, bad bitch in the whip and I ride to this
And I'm feeling it uh, hope when I'm forty I'm still in it
One of the few that be killing it, uh
Yeah, young motherfucker that be giving what he living
On the road to success so you know that I'm driven
But they didn't wanna publish it
But right now I'm on some other shit
I'm in a different world, I'm with a different girl
I'm with the same team, but it's a different scheme
Remember back when I couldn't even pay the bills
And I'll never forget how that feels back when I would

Okay, doing what I gotta do, flying at this altitude
I look out the window like Goddamn, that's what I really do
Don't know why I fear the planes, sometimes I wish to sustain
If I look back on it I would do it all over again
Nikki, Nikki, where you been? I can't wait to breathe you in
Been on this plane way too long, I can't wait to see you again
Oh my God this turbulence has got me sippin' on this liquor
Crazy, racist, white bitch looking at us
Like, ""Who are these niggas?""
First class, on they ass, all complain that's when I dash
Just landed in Europe and this model bitch is tryna smash
Now I'm riding on the train, all this shit inside my brain
Just left a hotel in Belgium, damn them waffles was insane
Smoking blunts in Amsterdam
Oh my God, this is my jam
""May-December"" by Mos Def
In my headphones, that's the man

Okay, fuck affiliation, I'm that dude that did it on his own
These thoughts inside my mind be fuckin' with me when I'm all alone
I really like this girl she bad as fuck, why must I run away?
It feel like self assassination, I can't put this gun away
God damn, what's the plan? Not complacent where I am
Reminiscing when I hit the road back in that mini van
Broke as fuck, not a dollar, whipping that Chevy Impala
Praying that we make it out this city, Lord willin', Insha'Allah
Up to date the couple years, now my idols are my peers
I was on the road to nowhere till I decided to veer
Put my everything into this shit, you know, I know you know this
Used to give a fuck what people thought, hoping that they would notice
Stop giving a fuck cause music gotta be the only motive
Mind racing on and off the track, I'm going locomotive

Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to about 1990
Shady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland
7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born
To a black father and a white mother
Father that wasn’t there
Addicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs
Same as his mom
(Way, way back)
So I’m gonna tell you about that, right?
And I’m gonna tell you about how
All this young boy ever wanted was happiness
All he ever wanted was positivity
All he ever wanted to do was entertain
And this boy went through hell
You gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy
'Cause how in the fuck is you gonna have
All these black babies with black men but you racist
Like bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is
You know, he grew up, her callin' him a nigger
The kids at school callin' him a cracker
Identifying as black, looking as white
Being told what you can or can’t be
This kid went through everything
He went through...
He saw narcotics in the household
Violence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped
There was crazy shit that happened to this kid
And he persevered while the whole world said
What they said?
Said you wouldn’t be shit!
You ain’t gon' be nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothing
And I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere
And that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity
See, he always saw things from two sides
He always saw things from two sides
He always knew that the message
Everybody was born equal
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
He knew that because he saw that
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way)
Because he was stripped and torn down
By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
And that did not know
And he was stripped and he was torn down
By his white side that did not know
These people that are ignorant
That cannot see the bigger picture
That must fight and kill and murder each other
But once again, all he ever wanted to do
Was spread a message of equality
For every man, woman, and child
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
Now imagine this child growing up
And seeing the craziest shit
Being a part of the craziest shit
Running around with the wrong people
Running around with guns and knives
And fighting and stealing and, and all this
Because he didn’t know, he didn’t know!
But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right
And he knew that he needed to get away from it
Now I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old
This child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
And then he would then come home
To about eight or nine hours of sleep
But spend four, five, six hours of that
Working on music, persevering
Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people
Just chanting his name
Hoping that it would happen
But the, but the, but the world said no!
Mothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
Ya nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka
No-no!
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first)
And he said fuck that
He said peace, love, and positivity
He said equality for all man
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah
Now I want you to also imagine
People telling him that he did not live this life
“You just a white boy
You ain’t never experienced that shit
You from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there
Oh no, no, we know, we weren’t there
We didn’t live with you, we didn't live in your Section 8 household
We didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household
We just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside
Outside, outside, outside, outside
And since you white, you gotta have money, right?”
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black man)
And this young man persevered in spite
Of what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be
(Take it back, take it way back
Take it way, way back to the first black)
And that man is here today, proud
A lover of all human beings
Regardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah
And he’s here to say:
Even though we’re all born and created equal
We are not treated equally
There’s extremists on every side
And you should just do your best to live life
And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
As long as they’re not hurtin' anybody
You can believe they’re going to hell
You can believe it’s not right
You can believe you’re superior, fine
Just stop killing each other59Embed"

[Verse 1]
I wonder what it feel like
To do that shit in real life
And now I know I got it
That's the reason No I.D. has signed me on the dotted
But it's still Visionary 'til the death of me
Yeah, I'm tryna make it but I gotta find the recipe
Greatest of all time, I want the world addressing me
At the hotel, these beautiful girls undressing me
I'm tryna stay focused, I guess that's the lord testing me
I knew as a child, that this was my destiny
They do it for the limelight
But I make sure my rhyme's right
Waiting till the time's right
Smiling at my mom's like
Smiling at my mom
Smiling at my mama
Moët what we sipping now
We was never tripping now
We on private jets, in other words, that means that we tripping now
'Cause they was over there, I was over here
They was too scared while I was facing my fears
I've always been driven, but they too scared to steer
That's why I compete with legends, motherfuck my peers
[Chorus]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 2]
They said I couldn't do it
Back when I was broke going through it
'Til I got a deal, now they talking 'bout ""I knew it""
But you wasn't there in the beginning
Nowhere to be found when I was down
But you show up when I'm winning
Uh, left me to drown, now I'm swimming
I do it 'cause I love this shit
Fuck the money, and the women, and the-
And the whips with the rims still spinning
I been at it since the beginning
All these girls screaming, ""Logic""
But I wanna hear my real name
Come from the lips of a beautiful woman, that's real man
Y'all act like I'm Superman
But I can feel pain
I shoulda gone crazy, and yet I'm still sane
Love it when they sing to us
Been shining what's bling to us
Yeah, over here
It's only been a year
I was dirt broke, now I'm balling like a sphere
[Chorus]
I'm the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

[Verse 3]
Now that I'm in the limelight
They hit me all the time like (Logic, you never call me!)
Shut the fuck up, ho
Let me get my mind right
'Cause this is for the fans
Who truly understand
Real all the time
All of y'all my fam
Shooting for the stars
And I ain't finna land
Giving everything I can
While they tell me I'm the man
Making music is the plan
Matter fact, you can call it plan B
'Cause I kill these rappers while they're in their infancy
And I be first to pop off -  infantry
Gotta keep 'em in line like symmetry
We all fam, same root, smokin' different tree
And all these people in the crowd sound like a symphony
Uh, to my ears
I love it when they cheer
On the road to success, these haters in my rear
I got nothing to fear
'Cause the whole team here
And everybody shouting (What they shouting?)
[Chorus]
You're the man of the year, man of the year
Man of the year, man of the year

Aye, this that shit
I'm looking at you 6ix
I've been feeling like a...

[Verse 1]
I've been feeling like a mothafuckin' postman
Sending letters to the people
All this knowledge that I got, I'm like an old man
Hold up, wait now oh man!
Let me back up in this bitch
I'm platinum in this bitch, I'm rapping in this bitch
Running the game, yeah I've been lappin' in this bitch
You know it's alright
Fuck around and they all might
Look at a brother different, I've been at it all night
I think I said it but I know I do it
This for everybody going through it

[Verse 2]
Back up in this mothafucka livin' like a goddamn king
Tell me money ain't a thing now
30 thousand feet above the world right next to the wing
Too high to hear the birds sing now
All around the world and back again it's finally happenin'
I'm lappin' in this luxury by nappin' in a big ass house
Chillin' with my homies on the West side, West side
Bringin' out my best side
I was on the road for like a quarter I was in and out the border
From London to Paris, yes it's very extraordinary
Fuck around and took the bus and a ferry
Should've seen the itinerary
Then we made it back home like woah
Tell me how you're feelin', higher than the ceilin'
I know I've been illin'
Probably wonder where I'm at, bitch I've been chillin'
Why they grillin'? Yeah I'm still in like I never left
They know I had to go but then I brought it right back

[Hook 2]

Do it like woah

Gotta get it like woah
In this bitch like woah
Get it like, like, like woah
Let's go—Uh, I'ma get it like woah
[Bridge]
I get so high they wonder why no I can't go away
I gotta hold my own, know that's the only way
I've been vibin', let me guide em, I said I gotta know
I've been ridin' for so long I think that it's time to go
Feeling like an addict that ain't had it, up and at it in a minute
If it hadn't been invented, my limit wouldn't be infinite
I'm feeling like an infant in a womb, I'ma be here 'til the tomb
Lately I've been in my room
Lookin' and lookin' at records on the wall
Hold up—

Much love to Def Jam, even though they under shipped me
Did me like Bobby did Whitney, but the fans was with me
Know my name around the world but it still ain't hit me
All the talent in the world and they still don't get me
I didn't talk about my race on the whole first album
But black vs. white bullshit was the still the outcome
How come these motherfuckers can't seem to let it go?
Judging rap by race instead of the better flow
Who gives a fuck who made it? I penetrate it and innovate it
While they emulate it, give a fuck if I'm hated
I'ma do it 'til I get it, fuck a nominated
Bitch, I dominate it
Yeah, emails from Rick Rubin, dinner with No ID
Chilling with B-I-G D-A-Double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Not many get to do what I do, and now enemies
Thinking they slick as fuck like the finna befriending me
But let's get back to the music, I'm gone
Outside of this solar system, I'm searching for paradise
Livin' the life, bitch, I've been a vet
Fuck all these cats on the internet
I love hip-hop and I hate hip-hop
'Cause people that love Pac hope that Drake get shot
'Cause he raps about money and bitches, for heaven's sakes
Pac did the same shit, just on a drum break
Now, I ain't wanna name names, I'm just droppin' this game
We all people, all equal—now let me let off, yeah
Now let me let off
Tougher than raw denim, my flow you can't identify
Talib said it best back in the day, we just tryna get by
Two words, Mos Def, in my headphones
Black on one side, now I'm in another zone
Switch flows, fuck 'em up—play the game, run 'em up
Yeah, I sold a couple records but people don't give a fuck
All the people want is real, guess that's why Logic appeal
All the power in the world; hold that, tell me how that feel?
Racism on television and magazines
Paying taxes so soldiers don't run out of magazines, god damn
Country don't give a fuck who I am
Just a youngin' on the rise with a mic in my hand
And I am, here's to the Roc
The .45 Glock that my older brother pop—shot
And I am, finally on top; too high up, not a drop
Stop, we gettin' guap, gettin' guap
I am, livin' like I ain't got it
Spit the flow so robotic, man, who gives a fuck about it?

[Speech]
It was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
As my body began to fade
In this moment my mind was full of clarity
But my body insisted it was in danger
I looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine
But I was convinced that something was wrong
Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
Fall and fade away
My body grew weak
And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
I refused to believe this story
I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
I began to feel detached from reality
I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
I got blood work done
Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
The doctor said it was anxiety
But how could it be anxiety?
How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?
How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?
Derealization
The sense of being out of one’s body
I’m not here
I’m not me
I’m not real
Nothing is
Nothing but this feeling of panic
Nobody understands
Nobody knows the sufferings
This physical feeling
It can’t be anxiety
It can’t
Or can it?
Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body?
Yeah, of course
I’m so in control of my mind and my body
But I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
I am unhappy
Not with life
But with this feeling
I am scared, I am human, I am a man
But I look in the mirror and I see a child
I am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit
And they never did
And it scares me
Cause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit
But one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me
No, no this feeling
This anxiety is nothing
I have anxiety
Just like you, the person I wrote this for
And together we will overcome this feeling
We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
That we are alive
And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
We will rejoice in this gift that is life
We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
Starting with mental health
We will accept ourselves as we are
And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror
We will accept ourselves
And live with anxiety32Embed"

En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
I'd like to try your Wu-Tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!
Wu-Tang!

[Verse 1: Logic]
Ayo, ayo, Wu-Tang forever, who rhyme better?
We too clever, the boom bap's back, harder than ever
R.I.P. O.D.B, comin' through like Killa Bee
Ever since I heard Enter the 36 in '93
You cannot defeat my Wu-Tang style, I leave 'em all dismembered
Fuck a mumble rap, that shit won't never be remembered
Not even a contender, no, pretender, best surrender
My agenda is killin' shit, they feelin' this (Sinatra)
Yeah, we live and thorough
Assassinatin' every single muthafuckin' borough
From Staten to Brooklyn to Queens, the Bronx and Harlem
All the way to Maryland, yeah, we comin' for all 'em
Bobby Tarantino to the Digital
My shit is pivotal, smokin' chronic, no medicinal
Who you know assemble the Clan like Voltron?
The one and only Logic, the God, the don, I'm gone
[Break: Ghostface Killah]
Ay-yo, Logic, what up?
We gon' let these muthafuckas try this Wu-Tang style

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, kaboom!
Guess who stepped in the room
It's Ghostface, gold plates, old truths, more cake
Intelligent brothers with nine hoods, movin' snowflakes
Guillotine your head, last scene in the showcase
Push weight, this Colgate, tre-eights and old gates
Exfoliate those we most hate, we don't associate
We wear robes that you can't even pronunciate
We eat foods where you can't even pronounce you ate
Cribs where the floor just rises up and rotates
Locations low-key, can't even locate
Twin nina sisters with the beam, we all soulmates
Team makin' us so much cream, we bought gold plates

[Verse 3: Raekwon]
Yo, mountains of haze in the crib of my blades
It gets messy underneath the dresser, the gauge
57 MB, yo, metallic green, seats is piped off
Seize 'em old tracks, unite through 'em
The kitchen is my palace, get your dance on
While we just levitate with trees, get your branch on
I'm known to wil’ out, put the cams on
Jewels down, the sets dip, my gems got grams on
A specialist when I'm bakin'
Rhymes be comin' out, we makin'
We challengin' these chumps for lumps
Here's the statement—stop hatin'
The crew is all about gettin' this cake in
You know about me, you relatin'
[Verse 4: RZA]
The enigma, the stigmas that the RZA and the GZA
Both lyrical prolific, fixtures of rap scriptures
Mixtures of hipsters, weed smokers, and beer drinkers
Prince and the Pauper, spiritual clear-thinkers
Cake in the oven, Superbad like McLovin
Huggin' all four boroughs, puffin' herb with my cousin
Academically speaking, rap vocabulary's weakenin'
I felt it comin' like The Weeknd when these starboys start tweakin'
Sporadic pill-poppin' of OxyContin
III-gotten sexual intercourse make shorty wop feel rotten
The travesty-tapestry of microphone mastery has been refuted
Diluted, broken down to a catastrophe
But cats still get the trophy, hit y'all with that ""Okie-dokie""
Burt Reynolds, Bandit, goddamnit
Where the fuck is Smokey Bear when you need one?
I got a light-beam gun
I'll blast a hole in your chest that you can't bleed from
But you'll die through iniquity, plus stupidity of that trickery
My verse got it hot up in here, not the humidity
You can never get rid of me, step back and consider me
Wu Killa Bee, but I'm not big on bigotry

[Verse 5: Method Man]
Old school on this track, I feel invincible
This new school ain't really got rules and lack the principles
Got more clowns than the Motown, they puttin' critical
The gun, Smokey Robinson, you need a Miracle
Go back, homie, back when rappers used to be lyrical
When nine out of ten of his friends used to be criminals
The stats, homie, all these killas usin' subliminals
Y'all don't even smile in your pictures, you dudes is miserable
Witty unpredictable torture over your physical
Struggle bar, used to pour water over the cereal
Another bar, reppin' my squad, not individual
But one Nation under God, that's indivisible
My time critical, hands off I'm digital
Me and my Ladybug, back when the planet was Digable
I'm cool like that, my cash rule like that
I'm classic, Patti LaBelle, Voulez Vous like that, come on
[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
It's only Logic, we got 'em mobbin' in the mosh pit
Fifth Brother, INS hotter than the tropics
The hot shit I drop quick
Major player, watch my stock lift
Razor-blade sharpness regardless to whom or what
Sound boy, turn that music up
Naysayer, you ain't even got a clue what's up
Deadly melody, the sickness, the remedy
Everything circulate back around eventually
Witty unpredictable, talent all-natural
Gain, Wu-Tang pumpin' through your veins
Twenty-five years, still more of the same
The flow like water with the boilin' flame
INS, your highness, they callin' my name
Boy, I wet the scene similar to fallin' rain
In our own lane, y'all soundin' all the same
Tell 'em Wu-Tang is on your brain

[Verse 7: Cappadonna]
Survival of the fittest be cold days with no money
They don't want me with stacks, they better take it from me
You know the currency gone soon as you break a twenty
So I ain't down if you ain't talkin' that band language
Dear Lord, I'm tryna buy me a train with it
An airplane, see me flyin' to Spain with it
But money don't make me, and I ain't gonna change with it
I'm in the hood, lookin' good, the way I came with it
Do it for the Cs, they understood the game with it
We gave birth when we understood the pain with it
When we create wars, everybody is a gangbanger
We killin' each other, but we all got the same anger
Never go against the grain, homie, that's hateful
Another day in the life for us to be grateful
Spread love, homie, yeah, get a plateful
It's better to stay full, so let's make moves
I know your momma told you that I was a great dude
These dirty-ass cops, they kill and rape you
On some Jason shit, might Crystal in the Lake you
What? What, what? They might Crystal in the Lake you

[Verse 8: Jackpot Scotty Wotty]
Boom bap blast'll blow your sleeves off
Our Flashback Jacks are somethin' to feed off
Smoke and roast ya, the No. 9 Potion
Pull that shit, son, we open the ocean
Who gives a fuck who's snortin' and drinkin' and smokin'?
You get killed for jokin', everybody's hopin'
That's another level of emotion
Food stamps niggas doin' grocery
Police wanna grope me
Perp walk, then nigga street-talk
We bury niggas in sea salt
I carry the torch where I leave off
I'm givin' bitches somethin' to breathe on
I rip off a shoulder to lean on
It's fair game, it's two in a lane, she took two trains
And none of my rhymes are two and the same
Nigga get cooked on a open flame
I'm a hillbilly, Park Hill-trained

[Verse 9: U-God]
My rhyme starts riots in the mountains
Thirty-six million and countin'
The harder they come, the harder I go
Loosen up my arms, can I get comfortable?
Stay on my tip-toes, old-school Wu beat
This is a flip-phone, dude, your slips showin'
Where I come from it stays snowin'
The grammar is raw, I'm slammin' the door
Beez bang bong in your jaw
I hit 'em in the head with the hammer of Thor
Stars and bars, makes me a general
Anything less, makes me a criminal
Gotta dig deep for these Wu-Tang minerals

[Verse 10: Masta Killa]
G.O.D., shadowbox with the L.O.G.I.C
On the count of three, Wu-Tang
First, master your breathin'
I'm mental ass-whoopin', I'm teachin' when I'm speakin'
I'm a champion from Brooklyn
I'm movin' super-ninjas and Shaolin executioners
Avenger, a righteous defender
Grandmaster from the 36th Chamber
Toad style is mentally strong, so strengthen your arms
To hold my microphone you need iron palms
Remain calm, Jamel Irief
Wise chief, Wu-Tang poison clansman from the east, yeah

[Verse 11: GZA]
Enter a world of a universal mind of one kind
A thick swarm of words that's expressed in one rhyme
Food for thought, impossible sliders with the seasoning Regardless, I speak logic—clear reasoning
The uncivilized, get the mineral lines, quartz
Self-directed, calculated, controlled thoughts
A point-of-view of the thinkers
Monumental architecture, amazing as the Incas

[Break: Cappadonna]
(Sinatra) (Wu-Tang)
W.T.C., ah-ha
The faculty
Ain't nothin' goin' on, don't nothin' move
Nobody slide, nobody get hurt

[Outro]
En garde, I'll let you try my Wu tang style
I'd like to try your Wu tang style, let's begin, then
Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu tang sword style
If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu Tang could be dangerous
Do you think your Wu Tang sword can defeat me?62Embed"

Me and my team gotta intervene
What's the point of living if you ain't living a dream?
We live in a world where everybody want everything
Everybody want a better thing
Tryna fool ya like it's picture perfect but it's just the editing
Man, the game been waiting for a better king
I've been posted with my Queen like Coretta King
Screaming ""Money ain't a thing"", cause it ain't
Man, I never knew that living out a dream
Meant living out a suitcase, I've been working at a new pace
So much money on the road I ain't even had a minute
Not a single second chilling in my new place
Motherfuckers getting two-faced
Cause a brother finally eating
Not to mention everybody gettin' two plates
You know I only got two traits
Drop hits, get money—run it

[Verse 2]
What the fuck is there left to talk about
I told them my vision, let 'em know what it's all about
Industry only respect me because I'm ballin' out
You never know who there for you until you fallin' out
And that's the reason I've been in the kitchen
Working on that nutrition, now let 'em listen
Boy, this been my house, this is merely an addition
Fuck 'em and their permission, they was killin' the game
Who the one that gave 'em remission?—you know the name
Who else you know on the come up, do it like I does it
Lyrics all up in your skull like when the barber buzz it
Say my last shit a classic, and I wonder was it?
Come to think about it everybody seemed to love it
I was workin' on a budget, second time around shit is different
Cause they know that boy good, know he does it
I've been at it for the people that been lovin' my shit
Not the people that been hating
They can suck my dick—run it
[Interlude]
I'ma do somethin' different for the last one
I'ma go in...

[Verse 3]
Feelin' like Matthew Mcconaughey
On an Interstellar mission in Chicago
At the bottom of the Riviera
I wonder who I would be if I wasn't in my era
I gotta beware of the people
But I take care of the people
When I jump in the cockpit and rock it
Been done had this in my pocket
I had to wait to unlock it
Open that locket and see the picture I painted
No, we ain't never acquainted
On the rise like a defendant
That was charged with possession like an exorcism
My division is solely my vision
God damn, can you feel it?
Uh, I had a dream I would run the game and kill it
Had a dream, can you feel it?
Motherfucker wanna push it to the limit
Get up in it, make the shit infinite
Yeah you know I wanna win it, on my independent
I've been at it like an addict
Never at the party like I'm democratic
'Lotta static on the radio
Fuck everything that they represent
This right here is heaven sent, never irrelevant
No never when I slide up in the spot
Just a youngin' in the game
Tryna show 'em what I got, way back
That was the mentality, never truly reality
Looking for validation
With all the wrong things on my mind for motivation
Just chillin' at the crib on a PlayStation
'Cause I never thought about it, never thought that people would have a song like mine in their rotation
Til I wised up, got 'em sized up
Ready to go, I'm feelin' fired up
Man it's been a good ride up
Everybody want me to lace 'em
I'm too tied up, this a ransom—
Fist full of money then we head back to the mansion
30 thousand people in the crowd, we expanding
Couple years back you ain't give a damn
Autographs off the plane whenever I land
All part of the plan, anything you wanna do you can
Just go and get it, fuck 'em if they don't love 'em
Be above it unless you're thinking your profession gon' be rap
Matter fact, you should take a step back—cause I run it60Embed"

It's that Young Sinatra shit, yeah, that's that Young Sinatra shit
Shut the fuck up and listen whenever Young Sinatra spit
Yeah, your girl fine as hell but she a Young Sinatra chick
Hey Bobby, how can you tell? She on the Young Sinatra dick
All these rappers wack as fuck, make the Young Sinatra sick
RattPack be the squad, that's that Young Sinatra clique
Goddamn, said this the Young Sinatra clique, goddamn!
Listen, yeah—I’m visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Step to me, fatality; yeah, this shit is my galaxy
I am who the baddest be, I'd rather be at the academy
Killers, I'm be glad to be me, magnify the shit like bifocal
Motherfuckers talk on the internet, but in person they never vocal
Come to the hood and fuck you up if you prefer to be local
I'm loco from Noho to Soho
Gettin' cheese like a photo, you know, ho
I'm blessed like Sunday, flyer than a runway
Lil' Bobby never second-guessed that he gon' make it one day
One–way or another, my brother, word to your mother
They should give me a badge 'cause I'm always under covers
Goddamn! I'm a miraculous man!
You know I get, I get it, I get it, I get it
The Young Sinatra spit it, rewind it, and rip it
I could murder your whole album with a 30-second snippet
Pass the Mary Jane like I'm runnin' a train with Peter Parker
On tour, I have more sex in the city than Sarah Jessica Parker
The deeper and deeper I go, it get darker
They say they want the old me, they want the Young Sinatra back
The one that murder it, rip it up, no, never givin' up 'round the almanac
Yeah, I'm all of that, fall back, like September again
Bashin' these rappers so hard they won't remember again
When it comes to hip-hop, bitch, I'm indigenous to this
It's apparent I'm bearin' down like a parent
When the beef is at stake, I'm Mastro's
My god-level lyricism surpass flows, I'm much more than fast flows
Money, talk, cash knows, greatest of levels–I've passed those

And none of y'all ready for the massacre, though
Fuck with Logic? Yeah, that's a no
Matter of fact, it's not impossible, just highly improbable
Like, saying the police isn't robbable
But I'm liable to walk up in the station in blue-face
Like, ""Fuck the police!""—Blue lives ain't a race
Fuck whoever said this rap shit was never a race
This shit a marathon
Murder you motherfuckers and carry on
Claimin' that you really 'bout this shit

Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here

I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back

Just money counters and kitchenwear

Bruh, yo (Nah sayin'? It was somethin' that-)
Guess who I met last night, man
You know your land-, land chick? The fuck (Woo)
Oh, yeah, man (Ayy dog, I don't know, man)
Now that chick bad last night (God-damn-, fat ass), bruh
She just run up on me like, ""Yo"" (What?)
Nah mean? We talkin' and shit- (Crazy)
We gotta-we gotta stay- (Blap-blap!)
Oh, we heard man
It was cool, opp (For sure), you know, got crazy, so I had to let 'em out
(Yeah, faggot-)
Crazy thing that I heard, the homie say he ran around the corner from here
(Is that right?) Right around the corner, nah mean? (Boy, wait-wait-wait)
(Right around the corner?) Nah mean? (It's on, it's on!)
Sort that new life, he should look out (I'm gon' kill a nigga tonight)
Okay (I'm like-) (I mean if-) (Shit)
If somethin' go down, man, we ready, man, ain't-
(Nobody-nobody) and we ready, the whole hood ready (This car creeping)
(Looks brazy-) damn, oh shit!- (Oh, shit!)
Go, go, go-! (In the roof!) go-!
[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, outside I can hear 'em bussin', bussin'
And the police they rushin'
Go to my head like concussion
I'd rather not have this discussion
My mind racing for the elevation of the toxic in my blood
Where my mind, don’t know now
But I know where it was
I need Nikki, where is Nikki?
Baby girl, please come and get me
Now I’m old and shit is trippy, but I know that God is with me
This that baby mama drama
Give a fuck about a man, I know I'ma
Be there for my son, talking with my sister, it begun
End of the month, that’s the worst of the month
But the first of the month put the weed in the blunt
That welfare check, check
Won’t ever bounce like my daddy did
But I’m glad he did 'cause it made me strong
Made me help somebody with this song
Paint the picture of my life
Growing up what it was like
Section 8, grab a plate
Food for thought, gravitate
Food stamps, Social Services tryna take me away
My mama locked up, I pray to God that I see her today
Maybe not, maybe so; West Deer Park, that’s all I know
Just me and my homies, people that know me
Only ones that know
Around my way (Around my way)
Living day by day (Living day by day)
Corn rows and hang time, automatics and gang signs
Five-O with them K-9's
Manhunt when it's game time
They was robbing the ice cream man in broad day
Now I’m running from the police
Don’t know how, but I got away
Selling weed to my homies
And a girl in the building that know me
At 15, such a fiend, for the shit, that I seen
All my homies smoking green, fucking bitches, sipping lean
It was king, it was cool, seemed like something I should do
Such a youngin, such a fool
Now I’m breaking into school
'Cause my homie told me to
What to do, what would you?
When will I lose my anonymity
And become one with the enemy?
Tell me, would I be the enemy?
Feel like nobody in front of me
I can feel the vibe
[Interlude]
Bobby, what are you thinking?
What are you dreaming about?
Bobby, what’s inside?
What are you thinking right now?
What are you thinking?
Go to sleep

[Verse 2]
I guess maybe I was thinking things would be different now
'Cause when I wake up, my dreams fade
Everything cascade
In this vanilla sky, I feel like David Aames
Why must I open my eyes?
I wish I could stay asleep forever
Attain every goal I wanted and watch it repeat forever
Will it happen? Maybe never
Maybe so, I got to know—but tell me why, uh
I picture myself at the top but I know that I’m dreaming
Will I wake up before I finally confront all my demons?
Maybe not—All I know is this life I live
I can’t live it no longer
Wish I was stronger, wish that I could survive
Turn on the TV, let it wash my brain
Pretend that family’s my family to avoid the pain
Hello children, how was school?
It was good, how 'bout you?
I love you (I love you, son), I love mama too
Are you ready for dinner?
I’m able to set the table
'Til I snap out the fable when that TV turn off
And I realize I’m back in hell

Living life on the East Coast
Way back in the day trying to beat most
Anybody that wanna do what I do
Well let me keep it one hunnid with you
It ain't about that; ain't about Hip Hop, ain't about Rap
Take a minute, hold up, wait, now use your cap
Chicago, know I'ma snap
Nah, this ain't no basic rap

[Chorus 1]
And so they wonder who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high

[Verse 2]
Back again, never outside so I'm acting in
I laugh again when they don't understand
What I mean, bias; everybody seen by us
Everybody wanna live a life like this
Man fuck that, do what's good for your family
Make music like there's no Grammy
For that last line, they might ban me
I don't give a fuck though
'Cause I am me, from Beijing to Miami
I'ma just do what I do with my crew
Ain’t no telling what I'm finna do
But I promise that I'ma keep writing for you
And I know what to do, everything right here for you
Only for you, depending on what you gon' do
It's all for you—it's all for you
[Chorus 2]
Who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high
[Verse 3]
Let me take this time to find the rhyme
And know that I'm the only one
To find the one, the time is done
Beyond the sky, beyond the sun
There is no one besides the only one
And you know I gotta let 'em know
If you love it, let it go
At an all-time low and all I know is, all I know
I do what I love, came from below and then rose up above
Created a world no one has been to
Everything that I'm into, everything that I've been through
Bring it back like, let it shine like a Bat Light
Reminiscing on that night, gotta take flight
Everybody probably wonder what I'm living like
In the middle of the night, I might write
Despite what they say is right and wrong
Despite they wonder (Wonder)

[Chorus 2]
Who am I—so high (So high)
I said they wonder who am I—so high
[Sample: Alan Watts]
We'd like to be painters, we'd like to be poets. We'd like to be writers, but as everybody knows—we can't earn any money that way. What do you want to do? When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do, I will say to him you do that—and uh—forget the money. If you say that getting the money is the most important thing, you will spend your life completely wasting your time...

You'll be doing things you don't like doing in order to go on living, that is to go on doing things you don’t like doing, which is stupid! It is absolutely stupid! Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way. And after all, if you do really like what you’re doing, it doesn't matter what it is—somebody is interested in everything—anything you can be interested in, you will find others who are...

But, it's absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don't like and to teach our children to follow in the same track. See, what we are doing is, is we're bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living—in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life, by bringing up their children, to bring up ""their"" children, to do the same thing. So, it's all retch and no vomit—it never gets there. Therefore, it's so important to consider this question...

""What do I desire?""

But the truth is, my subject matter has been the same
And my production selection is still flame
But they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame And you still they little secret
That's the type of bullshit that they frequent
From 19, to 2019, been murderin' this shit for a decade
From the boom-bap to the trap, I let my shits cascade (Listen, yeah, yeah)
So what's the dealy? Pass the Phillie, get silly, that's on the really
We snappin' like Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, I'm talkin' achilles
Try to play me like I ain't me, but I provided all the deets'
Who you know worth 50 million, still rappin on break beats?
From Nasty Nas, Big-L, Tribe, The Roots, and many more
Of course we could never forget Biggie and young Shakur
Fuck the police, no we ain't fuckin' with Al Pastor
I'm the bastard that mastered the flow, I said it once before fa' sho'
While 6ix produce the kicks from the soul, you already know
Fuck these youngins talking outta they ass with no class
I'm here to school 'em
This that real shit, I'm never foolin'
I'm killin' these squares, we call it a massacre
I got the bread, but these fuckers need the dough like a baker
The legends above me love me like the RZA, like Nas, like Jay 'Cause I mastered the flow from back in the day
Respected by my peers from Drizzy to Cole to Kenny
Thank you for the love and inspiration plenty
Yeah, I'm loved by many, and only hated by a little
[Verse 3]
Now I think it's time to switch to lyricism, peep the riddle
I was born in mint condition, I'm everybody's life's mission
All right, listen, put me 'round your neck and I might glisten
The ultimate connect, I'll get you anything you need
From good credit to good weed
I can make any woman succeed
Control you with a heart of greed
Along with anybody that's in need, I'll make 'em beg and plead
I'm in the pocket of mafia crime lords and presidents
Without me, they'll evict you from your residence
Hov wrote about me on ""Dead Presidents,"" never irrelevant
Not a soul on earth would love me if I weren't me
No matter what year I'm in, I'm current, see?
People that have me, yeah, they power's so immense
But people without me, make no sense, god damn
Yeah, the world revolve around me, the law evolve around me
The shit people do to get a piece of me astound me
Blood stains my face when drug deals go wrong
I'm given to the greatest athletes when they go long
You could put me in check
But I'm still laughing all the way to the bank
I'm the reason that the Titanic sank
I'm always there for you, yeah, when it comes down to the wire And some people even tuck me away 'til they retire
I usually come around on the first and fifteenth
If you owe me to somebody then they'll leave you beneath
People go crazy when they feel me
In the Middle East they drill me
If you let your guard down, then some people'll steal me
I knew these two dudes that's always been homies since fifth grade
Always schemin' on the block, selling crack to get paid
Now they never graduated, thought that shit a charade
Only thing on they mind that wasn't me was get laid
Then one day, they had a falling out on the block
See, one thought the other one had been stealing his rock
'Cause he coulda sworn he had more weight in his stock
Pulled out the Glock and his homie yelled, ""Stop!""
But before he had the chance to pull the trigger
Oh shit here come the cops
They saw the gun and blew them both away
Now there's two more kids dead in the street all before twenty Over me, the most important thing to man: money
[Chorus: AZ & Logic]
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch
Like Sinatra, screamin', ""Motherfuck the cops""

[Break]
We just some motherfuckin' kids
We just some motherfuckin' kids

[Outro]
We love and m -iss you, Mac
For those of y'all who don't know man, Mac is the whole reason that I started doing this Young Sinatra shit. I remember I loved Lord Finesse, all the shit he did with DITC, Diggin in the Crates. ""Hip to the Game"", one of like—one of the illest beats ever and I remember when Mac flipped that shit for Kool-Aid and Frozen Pizza—I thought it was the dopest shit man. Mac showed me that I could just do it all on my own—me and all my boys, all my homies— and if it wasn't for him killing that beat I would have never got on that beat for my very first mixtape Young Broke and Infamous. Damn... that's like 2010. And I titled the track ""Young Sinatra."" And that was the birth of all this shit. So, thank you, I appreciate you, love you and miss you, yeah
Yeah, we just some motherfuckin' kids31Embed"

(Visualizing the realism of life in actuality)
Various women, I'm swimming in, like a shark
Hip-hop heads never die, we multiply then dominate
(Visualizing the realism of life in actuality)
C'mon this sound, it had to come from somewhere, right?
Uh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Various listeners is wishing us death
Don't give a damn, I'm reppin' Young Sinatra till my last breath
Easily my darkest confession is lyrical aggression
Through indiscretion that triggers anti-depression
When addressin' my profession in every session
The fact that I'm alive is such a blessing
Sippin' wine while these honeys undressin'
What I'm about to say is highly confidential
And in the music industry today, very essential
So bust out your pencil, you can do it on your own
Stop thinking that these labels is the ones that put you on
Let's change the topic, who's your favorite rapper?
I'm the top pick, ha
The flow is elegant, never irrelevant
How many times must I say this?
Cock back and spray this, never delay this
I pray this, reaches the masses
And spread like cancer on they asses
Now allow me to catch wreck, bust rhymes like Tech
Put me in your box and I destroy the deck
[Chorus]
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes
That buck that bought a bottle

[Verse 2]
Whipin' through Cabo in a Murcielago
Dodging paparazzi with the finest dime I met in Chicago
The baddest Bobbysoxer that you ever seen, reppin' my team
We real all the time, so my squad keen, bing
Dave, it's me Sinatra and my boy Dean
The way we (Winning) I can't believe there isn't a Sheen
And pregnant women listen and they give birth to a fiend
I spit narcotic epidemic all up in your genes
In layman's terms, I disperse a verse you never seen
Assassinate rappers the moment that they intervene
While you in the alley playing dice
I'm in the yacht contemplating plans for the next diamond heist
Art thieves and jewel connoisseurs
I study every part of they mind and make my rhyme better than yours
Elevated by being hated, sleeping on the brother like they heavily sedated
Some say I'm one in a million, I say I'm one of a kind
Only cocky when I rhyme, I'm Muhammad in his prime
[Chorus]
(Life's a bitch and then you die)
I used to bust tables, now I bust rhymes

I swear to God, I'm the reincarnated Young Sinatra

[Verse 3]
Yo, address the mic and start spillin' like I hit the vein
Back in the day they used to sleep on me like Tryptophan
Touchdown now the city screamin' my name
I flow gunshots and break fingers just to shift the pain
Whoever hate ‘em, I levitate 'em like David Blaine
Black Ops state of mind, play the game like campaign
Bumpin' Santana in the finest Copacabana
In Havana with a honey by the name of Hannah
Wearing nothing but a bandanna
Pussy wetter than Louisiana
You know the deal, peace to Miilkbone, I keep it real
Flyer than a man of steel, motherfucker how you feel, It's Logic
[Outro: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day, I’m 20, it’s a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body
Now I’m fresh and my physical frame is celebrated
Cause I made it one quarter through life
Some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
My skull cause it’s pain in my brain, vein, money maintain
Don’t go against the grain, simple and plain55Embed"

Finally slow it down and realize she ain't nowhere near you
So now you gotta stop (Stop), park (Park)

What about Vanessa? What about the baby?

You find out you’re dead and the first thing you worry about is others
Man, answer me, what about my family?
What’s going on with Vanessa?
They’re doing just fine
You see, your wife was cheating on you
Wait, wait, the bitch did what?!
And even though she loved you dearly
She was a bit relieved you would never find out
Wait, what the fuck you mean she cheated on me?
How you gon' tell me I’m dead then gon' tell me my wife cheated on me?!
Atom, none of that matters now
Walk with me
Wait, what is this? Is this...Is this heaven?
No
Well, I don’t see no pitchforks
Little red people runnin' around
It ain’t too hot up in here so I guess this ain’t hell either

Now this that SpottieOttieDopaliscious, hella vicious
I wonder where is this, hold up
Get the fuck out my business, show enough
We roll up then load up
Just a bastard born out of wedlock
Close to the Earth like a dreadlock
Got my sites on deadlock
Visions of my enemy in a headlock
Feel like I'm livin' in Bedrock, surrounded by rubble
Just a youngin' in trouble
Took a shot and then made it a double
Took a shot and then made it a double
This that food for thought, my school ain't taught me good
No ingredients in my hood
But a tablespoon of this baking soda
Gon' make it good, like it should
That's ignant isn't it, hold up wait
Now take a look at my pigment
Tell me again, we can never be kin
Based on the color of my skin
Matter of fact your lips ain't thin
That's a club I don't wanna be in
My DNA get done integrated
My God it's innovative
That's a million miles away from administrative
I fuckin' hate it, anyway—
Long ago, way back in the day in a place called West Deer Park
I was like 5, sit in my mama lap while she would drive
Police would knock on the door, I would hide
Then they would talk to me and I would lie
Hopin' I, don't die on this side of a .45
Then they would handcuff my mama and take her away
Over down on the driveway
Fast forward a couple of years and I'm bumpin' that Sade
Fast forward a couple of more and I'm bumpin' that ""My Way""
By Sinatra, so high, so high, oh my, God damn
Now I'm a grown man, oh man
What the fuck done happened to the plan
I know, as soon as I write this I might just go crazy (crazy)
Anything but lazy, I can't sleep (why)
Cause if I do, there's another motherfucker
Wide awake on the creep tryna kill you and he will too
We livin' like civilized people, but far from equal
I hope I live a long life and get to see my sequel
My son, my seed watch him grow and then watch him lead
Let me proceed, bumpin' that Californication, by the Red Hot
Fuck around and then hit 'em with a red dot
Y'all better not me fuckin' with me
Who, him? Yeah, me, I be the God MC

I remember my life long ago in my adolescence
I could feel the presence in my residence
Hesitant even thought it was evident
I should get the fuck—
I know something is wrong
Yeah, I know something is wrong
Feel like my mind gone
I know I play along, I might drown in this song
Huh, I'm so focused, huh, I know you know this
Uh, when I make a move and feel like no one notice
Uh, when I quit my job, uh, I fuckin' noticed
Shit maybe then I'm noticed, huh, but maybe not
Feel like this minimum wage is contagious
So outrageous my age is on my mind
Walking to work and I go blind
Sippin' on that Kool-Aid
Gettin' big wig money, that's toupée
Look around and see people with no class
Like snow on a school day
Y'all can't do what I do, do what I do
Starin' out this window like, like Erykah Badu
Livin' life how I do is crazy
This shit never amaze me
But I still let it phase me and I don't know why
All I know is my mind racing
A million miles a minute, the second I'm in it
Yeah, I be pacing, bitch I'm back again
Been here since way back when
Now let that shit begin, yeah
[Chorus 2: Logic]
This album two but this song was written before the first
My mind racing, I'm sick of pacing, I feel the thirst
Of those around me that down me and pray on my demise
But it only makes it that much better when I rise

[Verse 3: Logic]
This for the people that been through it and couldn't do it
Had a vision but blew it, while haters screaming ""I knew it!""
This is real, so real
The type of shit that make you feel like you gotta kill
Most of these people will never hit fruition
Paying tuition when they should've just listened their intuition
Now they wishing they was switching up their lifestyle
All alone with no one to dial
I'm just a man, I got problems
Understand, this is all I ever wanted
Yes, I do it for the fans and I ain't perfect
I've questioned if this life was even worth it
'Cause all the people care about is what lies on the surface
And my purpose is to do it like it ain't never been done
Always keep it real and remember where I'm from, now

[Chorus 2: Logic]

Wake the fuck up and give the people what they want
Man it's all love but the youth is confused
Your music is 20/20 but them political views
Is blurred I ain't trying leave ya name slurred
'Cause honestly I idolize you on everything, my word
But I gotta say what need be said
'Cause I ain't fuckin with that hat, with the colors that’s white and red
I know some people wish I’d act white instead
Say I’d use my pigment as a manifestation to get ahead
Fuck that, everything I do, I do it right
To teach the people that they have the power to fight
And not with semi automatic bullets in the night
So everybody, everywhere, listen to this fact
Nobody treated equally, especially the black
If you don’t get it the first time, bring it back
Now, everybody gotta fight for equal rights
'Cause the richest people in the whole world equal whites
To make it happen though we gon' need patience
And not violence, giving hospitals more patients now
Don't burn down the mom and pop shop
I'm just as angry another person got shot
Don’t be angry at the color of they skin
Just be happy that as a people we could begin again, and
I’ma tell you what I need right now
I’ma tell you what we all need
I need my people of color...
Don’t run from Trump, run against him
[Chorus: Logic]
Hey mothafucka I’m real as shit

I been in the cut, liquor in my cup, 38 tuck
I don’t give a fuck, I don’t give a damn
I just wanna live, I just wanna eat
But I gotta do it for the hood, do it, do it for the street, uh
Dope in the trunk
Creepin out the cut
9 by the gut
Never get enough
I don’t give a fuck
Stupid mothafuckas move backwards
Mastered the hustle
Something in the duffle for you bastards
Grind over chatter
Cheese on my mind like a packer
Only thing that matter, bitch scatter
You in my way, about to spray, the A-K
Middle of the day, like that shit’s okay
Never had a job, never had a education
Only know probation
Never had a job never had a education
Yeah, I never had chance in this world, I never had one
No, I never had a chance in this world, I was labeled a bad one

[Interlude: No I.D. & Logic]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Now send the blacks back to Africa
Build a wall for the Mexicans
Send the whites back to Europe
Give the land to the Native American
Take the skyscraper

C-Sick
[Chorus 1]
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

[Verse 1]
You ever wonder what it all really means?
Heart full of dreams?
I know I'ma do it, go get it by any means
Serving food for the thought like it's rock to the fiends
I said this shit for years boy, this life ain't what it seems
Sayin' that you can't just solidifies you never will
Said you would, said you could, but you ain't got the skill
You gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill
You gotta climb over your ego to master your will
Gave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension
God damn, I hope you're here for the intervention
You say you would if you had the money
Don't make me mention
It don't cost nothin' but time for you to pay attention
Now don't get me wrong
I know there's people out there hatin' on ya
And it feel like your self-esteem is breakin' on ya
All they ever seem to do is hate when you speak
They spend seven days preyin' on the weak
I know the world sleepin' on ya like a sedative
Talk all you want about me homie, I'ma let it live
Hater this, hater that, say I sound repetitive
Hatin' in your blood, you was born to be negative
[Chorus 2]
Never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to everyone that never made it
And the people that persevered even though they was hated
They had a dream and a vision that they follow like a religion
But on the real, the road to success is prone to collision
And every now and then something happens that's unexpected
Like that newborn in your life 'cause you was fuckin' unprotected
And I swear nobody perfect, hell, I know I ain't
Yeah I know this verse is heaven sent but I'm far from a saint
Live a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can
Learn from my father's mistakes and become a better man
Now plant a seed and watch 'em grow, teach 'em everything I know
Show him how to fight his battles and always go toe to toe
And this I know cause I been high, low, right, wrong
But I had to do it all just so I could write this song
I spit knowledge like the listener is my only son
And grip the mic like I'm at war and it's my only gun
Sometimes this journey to the top can be a lonely one
Yeah, and this victory lap a lonely run
While my hometown screamin' you the chosen one
Tellin' myself, don't choke, don't be the frozen one
[Chorus 1 (Extended)]
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
What I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been
I've been workin' like I've never been
I struggle every day but I just can't let the devil in
And if I knew back then what I know right now
I'd be better than I've ever been, better than I've ever been

Hold up let me get up in it now
Bitch, I'm here to win it now
L-O-G-I-C, I'm feeling free, I'm finna bring it now
If you know the words, take a step back and sing it now
Never thought I'd have to, but I keep the windows tinted now
Like, la-di-da-di, who got the keys to my Audi?
Last time I said, it went viral, I don't fuck with nobody
And I don't fuck with you, you, them, her and him too
'Cause don't none of y'all know a fucking thing 'bout what I been through
And all that superficial shit you love I'm just not into
And when it comes to gettin' deep in this rap shit I've been to
Like the pussy, don't push me
I ain't no killer, but you know the rest
You think I caught the holy spirit how I'm feelin' blessed
Ain't no contest at all this wack shit, it just ain't no test
Step and get laid to rest, boy, step and get laid to rest
It ain't no ""S"" on my chest but I'm still gunnin'
While half of these motherfuckers still runnin'
I've earned everything I've attained and they steal from him
Like goddamn, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Used to call you a hater, you a motherfuckin' stan
Ain't nobody built himself a brand like me
I ain't signed a shoe deal 'cause I'm waitin' for Nike
To recognize all these youngins wanna be just like me
Cut the check for twenty million right now and we might see
Everybody rockin' my kicks, preachin' positivity
I get up, I get up

I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up

Never address me as ""Robert"" 'less it's 'bout that Dinero
Far from a hero, I ain't never saved my hoes
I'm not defined by these clothes, and zeros
It don't matter if you got six dollars or six figures on the creep
'Cause in the end we all six feet deep
Meanwhile, I'll be immortalized on this 6ix beat
Flashbacks of havin' visions way back in G'Burg
Every single one of my homies and me work
Cuttin' had to get up out it, make a hit, forget about it
Youngin' wit' a dream but nobody gave a shit about it
Ten years later, pick up a pen, write a hit about it
And back then I thought I'd be defined by how good I rhyme
Not like these rappers with shit flows, but look good online
Not made to feel bad for speakin' bout this shit on my mind
Or called a faggot, a nigger, a cracker who wish he was blacker
I wish I could face my homophobic, racist attacker
And smack the shit outta they ass as peaceful as possible
It's highly improbable, it's stoppable
But still, way too many people feel how I feel
That's on the real, on the real, on the motherfuckin' real
[Chorus]
I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up

I get up, when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground

Ayo motherfuck a Trump, said that shit on my last album but you wasn't tappin' in
Fuck a mumble let's make America rap again
Industry don't give a fuck about rap or what's happenin'
Fuck a hypebeast, bitch, now who seein' me?
Nobody reports the music, this shit, this rap TMZ
Nowadays everyone divided, so I collided with headlines
Preach that, go 'head boy now preach that
Wash my hands of this negativity, word to Three Stacks
So fresh, so clean, who the illest on the scene?
Wu-Tang, get the cream, Sinatra gon' reign supreme
Open your mental, get out your feelin's like dental
This shit is consequential, lightin' a fire to the game
Can you rappers feel the flame? Nah, this shit won't be the same
Fuck a rap beef, I promise I want all of y'all to prosper
But deep down you know it's only gon' be one Mufasa
I'm the king, fuck the bling, but just might make you kiss the ring
All these rappers I came up on, I surpassed, I know it sting now
Don't try to twist my words and turn that into some shit
I love all you motherfuckers, just want to hear you spit
Dropped my last shit, the whole wide world applauded it
Game still ain't give me my credits, so I'ma audit it
I'm heartless like Kanye in '08
Yeah, that's word to NO I.D, now they all know who I be
I'm callin' out Jay-Z to jump up on the track with me and smack the whole industry

[Verse 1: Logic]
Yeah, I know we seen a lot of shit whole time we've been together
Thought we knew it all but just couldn't predict the weather
I think about you and imagine a house and some kids
And wonder if you found another and it's all his
See, baby girl, I know you love me even through the lies
'Cause honesty and truth is always found within your eyes
Sometimes I see you when you love it but you fear it
'Cause you try your hardest to run
But still feel me in your spirit, baby girl, I know you hear it
My heart is calling for you tonight
And even though the time is wrong I know the love is right
That's why there's so much emotion whenever I recite
Anything about this angel that lost its sight
Baby, you were my everything, but you playin' games
Fucking around got me feeling like blowin' my brains
But you ain't worth the satisfaction
'Cause all you do is speak of love but never lead to action
I used to count the days with you but now I just subtract them

[Verse 2: Logic]
You were my best friend but then you out me
I never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me
So in the end, it only shows that you don't give a fuck about me
I know you hearing the emotion that's deep within this letter
But I don't give a shit about what you think
I write it so that the people can feel better
That have gone through what I've gone through
Memories of a perfect love that's broken and haunt you
And if you think I write this song to taunt you
I don't want you
I want the memory of who you were
And what it was to wake up everyday
And have an endless love with an angel from up above
But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
And another path within my life is calling
'Cause I put everything below you (Everything below you)
Even my music, and when you left me, I didn't lose it
I channeled deep within my emotions and used it
My heart you broke it and bruised it
So now I address this microphone and just ooze it

Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time
I think about specific moments that I could rewind
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide
And truly understand the deeper things
That I don't know about
Now take a trip with me and vibe
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now
Here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see life different like this music shit just ain't the world

All different colors and creeds all come together for me

Doing 70 on this highway
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever
My endeavor like a feature film
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing
When I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie
That's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned
And I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies
On a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times
I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem
To stomach all of the beef around my way
I mean, I never wanted to live a life
Where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more
And so they wonder why, I said they wonder why

This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride

Bitch, I did it, I made it, I'm loved and I'm hated

Feel like every other day, me and somebody new related

Well, I don't know who told you that (My mama)
Well, she fucking lied
Ayy, wake up, wake up, get your cake up
Cut it up like it's cocaine, shake up
All the streets with all these beats
I body beats, I'm not discreet (Per-Per-Perfect)
This is how I feel on the inside
All you non-talent rappin' motherfuckers better run and hide
You worthless, you have no purpose, fuckin' imposter
You gots to get it through your head
You won't ever get no handout
Fuckin' with your ass, it'd be like throwing a band out (Per-Per-Perfect)
My flow increased, my dough increased
You know I leave them all deceased
I am a fucking beast, I'm from the East
I keep the peace, don't need a piece
But I keep a piece, got it, capisce?
That boy gon' eat, this is a feast
Once I release, I'm smokin' trees
I bought my shit, I don't need no lease
So fuck you up like Master P (Perfect)
This shit right here a masterpiece, I'm comin' in hot like the police

[Intro]
Aye, let me just rap...

[Verse 1]
I've upgraded while they've waited
Will they love it?, Will they hate it?
Never faded I evade it
Cause I never really want to complicate it
Think I've made it, yes I did
I'm giving them bars like a bid
Let me rewind it like a vid
""Did he just say that?"" Yes, I did
And they really wanna get it like I live
God damn mother fucker what I gotta give
Way back in DC, at Liv
On the way to that everlasting life
Will they rob you? Yeah, they might
Hold up, wait a minute, veer to the right
On this road to success, I've faced my fears
Then hop on that flight

[Hook]
I've upgraded

[Verse 2]
My bitch bad got a sick figure
Play 1 show and get 6 figures
We build bigger, money tall as a mountain, bitch
I've got Hilfigers, like goddamn
Yes sir, I know who I am
I'm that main man Martin, out here kicking out Pam
Just riding 'round with my Gina in that all-black Beamer
All the way from Maryland whipping out West Covina
Hold up, now check my demeanor
Yeah, your girl bad, my girl meaner
I've upgraded

[Bridge]
I've got the Akira on the wall
I just can't follow their law
Swear to God that they know me
They don't know me at all
And its all right, it's alright
I've upgraded

[Verse 3]
Let me bring in them new kicks like Timbaland
I gotta reboot with this upgrade
My metaphors on Cloud 9
And the meaning behind them is so vague
Before I created this universe
I had to fly through the Bermuda first
6ix on the beat, then we queue the verse
Now I'm in another world when the flow emerge
Feel like I'm in a Fifth Element
I'm in my element lost in paradise
Its me, you and Leeloo, Korben Dallas in Fhloston Paradise
Never by chance like a pair of dice
I don't give a fuck about their advice
I'm on another planet, no I'm not manic
Bitch I'm decompressed, know they can't stand it
Cause I pilot it and manned it the best
All they demanded was I gave up and laid that dream to rest
(God damn!) Hold up, wait a minute; fuck all that shit
I left Earth ages ago to avoid and duck all that shit
You know when we on
Making music that's gon' survive for eons
Bloodshed from America to Sierra Leone
That's that shit I can't be on, that's the reason I be gone
Yes, I keep it professional like Luc Besson and Leon

Aight, or—higher probably, right?
Fuck it, just record it. Who cares?
One, two...

[Verse]
I just wanna make these music lovers remember again
While the haters fall back like September again
I was hoping 3 Stacks and Big would assemble again
Drop the politics and bring us together again
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then
Maybe if I go platinum they'll remember me then, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I'm not defined by the sales of my first week
'Cause in my mind, the only way I fail: if my verse weak
As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
Compiled of different races, gathering from different places
I just contemplate, shout out to those who can relate
And even though it gets hard I know my fate
With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates, it's like

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Looking for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
I'ma get up today
I don’t know how but I'ma find a way
Searching for the sun in a world of gray
Feeling like my dream is a world away
What it feel like?
I used to wonder what it feel like
Yeah, used to wonder what it
[Chorus]
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold
I used to wonder what it feel like
But now, I know, achieved the goal
I ran the race, I won the gold

Watch
Watch
Y'all niggas overdoin' it
You gotta slow that shit down
Take your time, reevaluate your shit, it don't matter (Watch)
Niggas ain't got money, ain't got time
Fuck it, just say this shit

[Chorus]
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)

[Verse]
I live by the beat, I die by the beat, since 1990, I (I)
Live by the beat, I die by the beat, like MPC Akai
Who I name William after 'cause I get bills from these beats
Fuck the industry, you know we keepin' it real up in these streets
Came up in a world that's off its axis
All that's promised, death and taxes
Don't give a fuck who be rhyming the fastest, my anxiety
Make me spit it a mile a minute
I'm stuck in a clinic like Flynn Montgomery
Take a step back, tell me right now, boy, just what your summary
Creeping through fireside
Smash the window of that fire ride
Just to see what we can snatch from up inside
'Til the flashin' lights come 'round that corner then we run and hide
Prayin' to God up in Heaven, eleven at night and I got no alibi
My damn, dip to Stewart Town
Best not come 'round these parts if you new in town
Wonder what my homies from back in the day livin' at, are doin' now
Running with my sister Jeannie, schooling me like Mr. Feeny
This is the first time I heard a gunshot on the block
Growing pains (Three), this the type of shit don't never stop
Here come the cops
Shooting up the hood like Black Ops
'Cause trigger-happy police tend to trigger happy people
And some people who believe we not equal shoot up the steeple
My God, if you exist then why do you make life so hard?
If you exist the way you think is avant-garde
If you exist you got a funny way of showing it
What happens in the afterlife?
These people think they knowin' shit
And on that note, I keep it G
Like track four, ""Kick in the Door"" by Notorious B.I.G. 
Don't believe me, look that shit up, I promise you'll find the key
To that punchline, feelin' just fine
Let the abyss of my mind, my mind consume
Snap my fingers like Thanos and Bobby Boy bringin' the doom
'Cause I'm 6:30, killin' shit, hands down and dirty
That white boy can't rap, he talk good and act nerdy
I just texted Erykah Badu
To let her know what I'm gon' do
Sample ""Dreamflower"" by Tarika Blue
That's cool with you?
Yeah, that's fine, baby, all gravy
Long as you know you my baby
And I beat yo' daddy like if he ever cheat on me
I mean she don't own the sample but she might as well
'Cause her and Dilla paved the way for all I got, and, well
I'ma show my gratitude, no attitude, no auto-tune like T-Pain
Doin' Unplugged, I'm unplugged, like Trinity
Wonder how the people gonna remember me, goddamn
Switch up the plan
We all say it, we all claim it but it's no use
The greatest rapper alive is probably stacking produce
Introduce you to my train of thought
Snapping on a track like the illest conductor
With no contradiction
I brought my heart to the table
Fact and never fiction, fuck a fable
Ready and willing you better believe I'm able to spit
Power through these lines faster than fiber-optic cable, I'm gone
[Chorus]
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (I hear 'em callin')
I can hear 'em callin' me
We've come a long way since H.O.C. (Watch)

[Interlude]
Watch
From the bottom
When you come from the bottom, you ain't get no chances, man
I'ma do this shit 'til the Fourth Of July, blow up straight to the sky (Watch)
Nigga fuck it, we high
I remember when a nigga had to ask for money
It's been a long time since I had to do that shit (Watch)
This shit ain't free
I got the roof over my head and a bed, nigga, my bitch givin' me head
I'd rather get money instead
Man, it's Bobby Boy Records in this bitch
Y'all niggas better write this shit down (It don't matter)
'Cause 10 years from now, we on top
And we ain't never gon' stop
All money in (Watch)

This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking something gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothin', now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn, this is real life

[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah, I've been fiending for this moment
I've been dreaming 'bout this moment
I guess this is how it feel to have everything you ever wanted
Writin' these records like a dissertation
While the fans goin' crazy from anticipation
Damn, nine years that's a lot of patience
And now I'm lookin' at my idols and feeling adjacent
It's hell of a long way from back in the basement
Lookin' at hip-hop tryna find my placement
I bought my first pair of Jordans at twenty-two, huh
Same year I bought a crib too
Now my face in magazines I used to flip through
And my music on all the sites I used to sift through
Remember meetin' Nas for the first time
Shook his hand and he started quotin' my lines?
Said he a fan, goddamn, this is my time
I'ma get it, I'ma do it 'til we prime time
Yeah, I told him every single day that I be at it
In the studio recording like an addict
He said that real hip-hop shit I had it
Thinkin' to myself, ""Damn, man, you made Illmatic""
[Chorus]
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking somethin's gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothin', now my life has meanin'
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life
I used to wonder what it feel like

[Verse 2]
Aight, I guess we back again
With another verse about how much I'm black again
You don't like it? Blame God for the packaging
Bringin' up my race, don't call me a white rapper then
Damn, they judgin' me by my skin tone
Instead of my talent, man, these motherfuckers been wrong
But it's all good, I just thought I'd address it
And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it
This is dedicated to anyone wit' a dream
And a realization of what followin' it means
Breakin' the cycle and not following your genes
That perfect moment when your logic intervenes
And let you know that everything ain't always what it seems
But if you really lookin', I promise you'll find your dreams
This is everything I ever wanted, half of y'all won't get it
The other half will probably laugh and wonder how I did it
I just spit it from my mind, one word at the time
Take everything I'm going through and put it in a rhyme
I'd be lying if I said I didn't have a lot of weight upon my shoulders
But this is my therapy as I flow this
Spilling out my heart, I just hope somebody notice
I've been real from the start and you motherfuckers know this
Once my name elevated that's when the fame escalated
But on the real, I've grown accustomed to the stares
People watching every move I make like it was theirs
All up in my business, and even in my personal affairs
Now, I know I talk a lot of game, but I ain't tryna sell you
'Cause honestly, I could show you better than I could tell you
And even though there's been moments when everything have fell through
We kept it moving, assumin' even the greatest fail too
I swear this business shit is do or die
I never contemplated suicide, I'm too alive
In front of thousands, but I'm talking like it's you and I
And everyday, fewer find their dreams because fewer try
[Chorus]
This is real life, the only one we get to live
I remember being broke and thinking somethin's gotta give
This is real life, everything we do is legendary
And we gon' do it to the day we in the cemetery
Real life, it feel like I'm dreaming
Used to feel like I was nothin', now my life has meaning
Said this is real life, goddamn this is real life
I used to wonder what it feel like

[Verse 1]
So many people think that rap is they calling, stop it, just cease
Got it, capiche? This is my house, you fuckers just lease
Waitin' on a record deal that's never coming like a priest
Black and white like a nun
These up-and-comers our sun like the break of dawn
So follow your father like an apostle
Paint pictures like a Picasso while bitches uncover my fossil
Never knowing what's gon' follow
However we never wallow in our sorrow
Just pray for tomorrow
At times my heart could be hollow
Emotions forced to be swallowed
While neighborhood cats blast off gats like the Apollo
This is just a simple reminder as my lyrics force you to ponder
Life's a bitch and I heard she'll fuck you
So I'm trying to find her
One moment she'll love you then swallow
You whole like an anaconda
The bitch is kinky, kind of so with the lift of a pinky
I'ma dominate the world like my name is Brain
Spit flame like propane
Bitches I overcame you know the name
Ink in my veins, in flames, and spew on the page
To numb the pain like Novocaine, motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Allow me to kill it off the brake like no traffic
Murderin' every demographic
Paint a picture using only blood to make sure that it's graphic
Grip the mic to set the example
While all these muh-fuckers testin my patience like blood samples
Constant thoughts of suicide, we live in an era that's do or die
Society expects us to fail, I'm talking about you and I
But we persevere force feed enemies truth serum
We want, nothing but peace and if not we leave em deceased
In your central nervous system like heroin reppin' Maryland to the fullest
Bustin like bullets that travel through chambers ignited by triggers don't pull it
I get from point A to point B by keeping it G
Ain't no killer but don't push me
If you grab the heat, you a pussy
Knuckle up and tell me how you feel, forget the steel
I have not a single enemy
Only evil entities that have some how befriended me, in they mind
'Cause I am just a mortal man of peace that can rhyme
And when it comes to dames I catch planes
They catch feelings
Haters keep my name in they mouth like fillings
High as the ceiling
Y'all really don't know who your dealing with now
Visions of livin' until my flesh is perished and my spirit is risen
Thankful for every breath I'm givin'
Fuck social division
On the road to success and there ain't no time for collision
People ask ""how you get your flow so amazing""
To which I reply ""I have yet to scratch the surface like abrasions""
Haters takin' shots but they never graze him
Now if pro is the opposite of con
What's the opposite of progress?
I love my country but that shit a mess
Grew up on section 8, I can attest
And now they wonder why I claim that I'm the fucking best

Now if I don't believe it y'all won't perceive it
Now run it back and retrieve it
Till you receive it in your motherfuckin' mind
Only 22 but I feel like I'm 99
Back in 1999, that's when I began to rhyme
Surrounded by narcotics and crime but you know I shine
Daddy was smoking crack, I was raised by a single mom
Fasting every night I ain't talking bout no Ramadan
I was poor as fuck me and my mama, we didn't have a dime
At 16, the school system dismissed him and wished him well
But my mama never fought it, how the fuck could I prevail?
So I focused on this music and used it to create a life of my own
I left home at 17
Shortly after my mama got stabbed by fucking around in the streets
But she still breathin' which gives me a reason to believe in a higher power instead of grieving

Dear God, I'm trying hard to reach you
Dear God, I see your face in all I do
Sometimes it's so hard to believe in

[Verse: Logic]
Dear God, I think it's time we had a conversation
These lonely nights is getting to me so my mind is racin'
I think about this life I live and all the shit I'm facin'
More secrets in my mind than a Freemason
I get lonely at times, and then I write these rhymes
I'm only human, I want to hit the club and fuck a dime
But I know that's not the answer to my problems
Lord help me solve them, disintegrate and dissolve 'em
Layin' in bed with a girl I'm pretty sure is my next
Contemplating the sex while I think about my ex
Am I wrong? Yeah
Dear God, am I wrong? Uh (Dear God)
Dear God, tell me, am I wrong?
For livin' the life of a king surrounded by these pawns
Fans telling me I'm the greatest but I never hear 'em
'Cause I ain't hit the pinnacle, yeah, I'm still persevering
Demons whispering in my ears, but no, I never fear them
People thinking they on his level they ain't even near him
I just want to spread positivity through lyrical ability
They call it selling out but I just call it versatility
Yeah, it's my life, my wrongs, and my rights
My battle, my songs, and my fights
Now everybody want to come around?
Tell me where was you last year when a brother was down?
Not a single one of you motherfuckers believed in the brand
Extended a hand, and now you wanna be my man?
I think not, you quick to shape shift like ink blots
The real Dilla, we cut classic, no fitters
What about the time I was nine and my mama almost murdered me?
Don't think I forgot that shit, it still burdens me
Her bare hands tight around my throat
""I can't breathe"" I screamed, ""I can't breathe, Mama
Don't you want me, Mama? Don't you love me, Mama?"" What the fuck
Where was you then God? Tell me now
How's a brother supposed to stay sane? Tell me how
Why you let me live but let another die?
Why you dry my tears but let another cry? Gotta know
Set to detonate, I gotta blow, that shit fo' sho
I used to wonder why in the hell you would make me suffer
But now in the end I understand that it made me tougher
[Outro: Logic]
I get up when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough, I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, yeah
I get up, yeah, yeah
I get up when I'm down, had enough, almost drowned
When shit rough, I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, yeah
I get up, I get up

I want what I want how I want when I want it
I’ma keep it a hunnid, I’m blunted
I don’t give a damn, I don’t give a fuck about another man
Fuck a brother man
I’ma make it, make it rain like the weather man
Old girl shoulda, shoulda got a better man
Ass fat, lookin' good in my letterman
In the hood I’m a better man
Wish a mothafucka would, would
Whole life I been up to no good
Change it all if I could
Rearrange my heart, the beat good but I can’t
I’m a sinner, not a saint
Layers to my life, no I can’t
Cover it up with paint
Keep on livin', livin'
Livin' on money and women
As soon as I’m in 'em, I’m out
Now the truth never come out my mouth
Speak life when I come in her mouth, like

I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life, a waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me
People try but don’t know 'bout me
But the Devil said that he want my soul
But the Devil said that he want my soul
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
Give it to me right now
[Chorus]
Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

[Verse 2]
I’d rather be a different man in another world
Than work for the man in my universe
Wonder what it feel like to take flight
Momma told me everything gon' be alright
I mean my life can’t be off right
But come to think about it
Everybody runnin' the world seem to be all white
Can you mothafuckas see alright?
I mean, I need it, I want it, I gotta have it
Every day tragic
If you’re from where I’m from, everyday ain’t magic
On this I know
I been telling everybody I’ma give it a go, I know
I been there before, feel it in my soul, oh I know!
Love it or hate it, I made it
I did it, I lived it
While the whole world lookin' at the boy like whoa!
Baptized in a ocean of Hennessey
Really wonder what the remedy
Tell me, how the world gon' remember me?
Got me feelin like the enemy
Like I ain’t got no energy
I been lookin' for an entity
Feelin' like I need to chill, like I need a new amenity
Fuck all that

I’m a dirty mothafucka, a waste of life
A waste of skin
Wanna repent, don’t know where to begin
Next of kin don’t give a damn 'bout me
I know God don’t give a damn 'bout me

Somebody save me
I need you to save me
To wash away my sins on high

[Bridge]
I know my life was lived the wrong way
I know I did you wrong in my own way
But it was the flashing lights that mesmerized
That hypnotized the only
Part of me you loved
Part of me that had the strength to rise above
Part of me you know
Part of me you love more than to let it go
[Outro: Killer Mike]
Dear God, I just wanna know why
Why do you put us here?
Why do you put us below?
Why do you put us subservient?
Why do you put us below these evil motherfuckers?
And then we crawl and we scratch our way out
We betray each other
We lie, we take from one another
And we told you gon' forgive us at the end
But the state don't forgive us
I'm locked up and half my friends
And then when I get out, or I make it out
I'm expected to somehow give back
To people who never wanted to see me escape
I'm startin' to hate the man in the mirror
And it's gettin' clearer
That society was designed to keep me on the bottom
So, if you real, if you're out there for real
Please explain to me why
Why do we suffer? Why do we die?
And why do the people
Who go against everything you ever said always get ahead?
I've done so much wrong, I don't know if I can ever be right
But tonight, I am in this church
Asking you to show yourself, to reveal yourself to me
Because I'm tired and I don't know what else to do
So black I'm blue, so brown I'm down
I done been everywhere but up, and when I finally get up
I am ravaged with guilt and pain and shame
And all I wanna do is believe in you
The darker you are, the closer you are to dirt
And they make sure it hurts
And I am tired of hurtin', man
I'm tired of bein' looked at, second guessed, doubted, feared
So if you out there, do something about this

[Verse 1]
It’s funny how your role model gets outdated, becomes the old model
At the hotel, askin' for mo' bottles
Ménage et plus one, I’m fuckin' fo' models
Wordplay that elevates minds like Aristotle
Murci-lago, whippin' through Chicago
All these beautiful women follow wherever I go
Million-dollar deals on the table
Just a couple years ago, I couldn’t pay for cable
Growing up surrounded by 'caine like I was Abel
Shit was unstable, now Visionary's the label
Plus Def Jam, know who I am
I’m that motherfucker that do it just ’cause I can (The cannon)
Now I’m on a level that your elevator can’t reach
I got information that the school system doesn’t teach
I got verses that your Sunday service wouldn’t dare to preach
Second coming of Christ flow, they like, ""whoa""
Rapture you with lyricism, kidnap your soul
And changed your mind like I’m penetrating your skull
I seen shit John Lennon couldn’t imagine
Just me and a mic on a main stage spazzin'
It’s the type of shit normal people can’t even fathom
So much swag, kiss your bitch and she orgasm
I’m hazardous, you would have sworn I was from Nazareth
I’m resurrecting hip-hop like it was Lazarus

[Verse 2]
Step to the mic and they gon' dread it like Weezy
Man, this industry is so damn greasy
Swaggin' on the track, they say I sound like Yeezy
But I don't give a fuck cause gettin' money too easy
21st century, doing something mean to it
Play this in the south and everybody gonna lean to it
""Greatest of all time"" has got a nice ring to it
We do it for the music, money ain't a thing to us
Been shining muhfucka what's bling to us
Most loved, most hated at the same time
Star player in this bitch and it's game time
Who you know lyrically killed the club in the same rhyme?
They call me Logic, motherfucker, better know the name
I spit crack like Pusha (Yuugh!), Novocaine
We never dumb it down, you know we just numb it down
And watch you get up in your feelings when we come around
Grew up on section 8, you probably can't relate
‘Cause y’all just watched the throne, I’m tryna checkmate
I been shinin since before I brought them diamonds in, and
They talk that shit, they talk that shit, it’s so astonishin'
Y’all better swallow that pride like a klonopin
'Cause I can lay tracks with my eyes closed, China man

Got a show in LA Sunday, then New York Monday
Looking at the BET cypher like I’ll be there one day
It’s the Roc reincarnated, we call it Visionary
Fuck the world ’til I’m on top, we call that missionary
The game’s on pause, it need to load again
These rappers is reruns and we need a new episode again
Yeah, well motherfucker, this the pilot
So fly I recorded this on the PJ next to the pilot on a CB

Yeah, smoking in London while the snow fall
In another country, so pardon me for the roll call
Damn, who would've thought the fan base was this immense?
On the first fucking train to Paris so pardon my french
Shows sold out, fans in line even though it's cold out
Yeah, touring Europe getting swiss cheese
Many said I'd never attain it now I'm like, ""Bitch please, what up?""
Allow me to open up the verse with something so diverse
Now let the flow immerse, hold up; watch it disperse
Visions of Biggie, Big L and 2Pac just looking at me (Biggie)
From the gates of Heaven while the police booking at me
Open your mental while bitches give me brain with no dental
Y'all probably think I'm crazy for touching this instrumental
Shout out my cousin Ego, he know this shit's sentimental
Been doing this shit for my dogs, holding down the kennel
My ex hit me, talkin' 'bout she wanna make up
But on the real, I got no time for cover girls
Music is my main bitch, no time for other girls
I'm finna blow like Hiroshima, my demeanor get meaner
Watch me elevate to arenas, me without the mic
That's like Martin without the Gina, Venus without Serena
Now these thirsty bitches on the dick, we call that Aquafina
I used to bus tables until them tables turned
And everything I have obtained is everything I've earned
And everything I rap about is everything I've learned
So hopefully the listener can position a situation
Where they don't get burned and they can learn from my mistakes
Like I've learned from the greats to do whatever it takes
For Heaven's sakes open your mind, this shit one of a kind
Elegant and refined, irrelevant to the swine
What's the deal? Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville
On the real, to various people I do appeal, 'cause of skill
So this the type of shit I'm gon' keep making
That make MCs break fast like flapjacks and bacon
Rest in peace to BIG, and many other fallen soldiers
Never Hollywood, I'm grounded like a cup of Folgers, bitch I told ya
Allow me to open up your mind and mold ya
Indulge ya, within this shit I call the second Renaissance
The system broke and they sent Logic in for maintenance
'Cause all you wack rappers couldn't break change to make sense
I'm back again with another argument about how much I'm black again
Fighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin
It's kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you
That's ignant
Ain't seen my momma in a minute
'Cause growing up she called me a nigg​er
That would never amount to nothing
Racism from my own momma, left home 'cause of drama
But I can make it in the rap game, look at Obama
You ain't been in my shoes, you don't know my story
You don't know what's in store, but bitch I stocked the inventory
Fuck a critic with the balls to try to tell me how I feel
You wasn't with me as a child, never once did you feel
The pain of my stomach that manifested from the lack of meals
Headed to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels
We aim to keep it real and hell no we ain't never missing
Came a long way from eating when government gave permission
If you think these lyrics ain't deep, you too stupid to listen
Just an outcast with a mission to spit to whoever listen, bitch, it's Logic43Embed"

Leaving 'em hanging, my shit banging
Second that I came in the game, I'm aiming
Hold up, wait a minute, break it down for the laymen
(Do-do-do-do-do-do)
I'm killin' everybody, I'm the MC that the MCs study
Look up to me, little buddy (Do it like me, little buddy)
Save yo money, don't think about a Beamer
'Til ya sellin' out arenas, and you're ballin' like a
Ballin'-ballin'-ballin'-ballin'-
Everybody wonder what it be like
Now it what it seem like, now it what it dream like
Go like green light, somethin' what a fiend like
Do it for the drug and we do it for the love
And we do it for the high that we get, when we ride in the whip
And somebody pull up on you and they vibe-vibe-vibing your shit

[Chorus: Logic & Cordae]
Mama (Yeah, uh), look at me now
[Verse 2: Cordae]
Mama look what you created, now I'm super faded
And I'm truly hated 'cause I'm real rich
But she too elated 'cause she knew we made it
Got the Louis sueded on some trill shit
I be coolin', nigga, making stupid figures
But the truth is realer than the fake shit
Know they shoot to kill us, and produce the triggers
I go two gorillas on some BAPE shit
Look at all the fame and the fortune, the pain and extortion
The Range and the Porsches, the same, but it's gorgeous
Mama called me, said your name on the Forbes list
Thank God your daddy never paid for abortion
But sharing clothes, good times, I'ma cherish those
Now I'm stuck doing Paris shows
Embarrass hoes on carousels, I'm careless though
I bear the toe, don't tear your soul (My god)

[Chorus: Logic]
Mama, look at me now

[Verse 3: Logic]
Ayy, I'm the one that's where you're from
They get it done, I'm killing them without a gun
Take it in, rake it in like a leaf from a money tree
Keep it goin', keep it goin', get the money, get the money
When it's sunny, 'cause when them clouds come
I can promise it's depression
That's when you learn your lesson
Thought you was cut out for this, your profession
Go be the best and all of that, nah fuck all of that
No one call him back, yeah, no falling back
Breaking down on stage, break it down the page
Breaking down your age
Like, like now, all you do is compare, compare, compare Comparing yourself to the world
And you losing yourself to the world
And you're losing yourself to your money, your fame, and your fans
You have bigger plans, you is in demand, they don't give a (Damn)
Spend all your money on bullshit and drama

'Cause I am me, speak love, not hate, so they don't understand me

Welcome to the No Pressure program
[Narration: Orson Welles & Logic]
Good evening, this is Logic
And very happy I am to be back in the United States and back on the network
Even for so short a visit as this one
Back with old friends like No I.D. who is tonight's director and
Nobody argued the point, a lot of people asked us to do it again, so it's gratifying to get the chance— us to do it again
So it's gratifying to get the chance now (No I.D.)
Personally, I've never met anybody who didn't like The Incredible True Story
Now tonight, what we do have is a thriller
If it's half as good as we think it is, you can call it a classic
Quite possibly, a little escapade of mine involving a couple of planets which shall be nameless
Is responsible
Doesn't really matter
A story doesn't have to appeal to the heart, it can also appeal to the spine
And with two magic words

[Verse: Logic & David Hayter]
Ayy, no pressure
Never graduated, but I school 'em like professor
Growing up, the world always told me I was lesser
Growing up, the world told me I could not address her
Gangsters put that heat to your head like a hairdresser
If you press a issue on they block
(Hey, Logic, Snake here
I hear you're planning world domination through a new form of Metal Gear
Well, listen to me, it won't work)
This liquor that I'm drinking got me thinking 'bout some other shit
Feeling like I'm sinking like Titanic or some other ship
Word to your mothership, boy, this that gutter shit
Breaking down the weed to get high as Thomas and Kai
But y'all ain't ready for that shit, that's more like Ultra 85
Memories of powdered milk and roaches in my cereal
Praying that my crew next like cotton material
Never had a car, that's why I hate the fuckin' bus
Took the 61 to Germantown and hear them guns bust
Call it static, my headphones on, it's Illmatic
On my Rosa Parks, in the back writin' like B-Rabbit
How I carry it, murder the beat and then I'ma bury it
Producin' tracks for the underground like Harriet
Drop another number one and watch 'em all get mad again
Memorizing verses like the Vatican, I'm glad again
Empty the clip and then do that again
And now we ridin' 'round the city on a dollar twenty-five
Boy, you better keep your head down if you wanna stay alive
People telling you to stay in your lane, can't even drive
Tell you not to chase your dreams 'cause they chained to a nine-to-five
Bitch, I'm too alive like twins in the womb, come hither, consume
All of my memories from past and present like two identities
Logic fallin' off is an obscenity
Top five I better be, steadily
Doggin' these bitches like I'm a Pedigree
Obtain class with no degree
Fuck a GED, EBT, and the HOC
Feeling free, yeah, I'm feeling free
But it cost a fee to be the boss it cost to be
Over possessions like an apostrophe
It's chemical warfare on the block, who got the rock?
A tablespoon of baking soda leave you shellshocked
Leave the pusher in a cell block and his customer in a box
The government got my pops
The government can't be stopped
I'm a gladiator, this shit right here more like random thought
It's more like

Sometimes I think about the love that I had in the past
I truly miss it, but it just wasn't destined to last
'Cause our separation lit a fire under my ass
And now I'm gunnin' for the throne, yeah, that is my task
Just a youngin' with a dream that acquired a team

New-school style with old-school bars like Alcatraz
'Cause I ain't never second guess this music shit
I knew this shit was all I ever wanted, all I ever had
Born famous, now it's just time to convince the world
Ditch cats, like drainage if they disrespect it don't step through

Say it then I do it, my whole career's a prophecy now
Better grab your jacket, 'cause in this world we live in it's cold out
And when my album hit the stores it's sold out
Like these rapper's careers
I'm the sum of our fears
Fuck a Grammy nominated, bitch, I made it and I'm here

Yeah, fuck that shit

[Chorus]
You are watching a master at work (Yeah)
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
(You are watching a master–)
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement

[Verse 1]
Grew up broke as fuck, rich folks was adjacent
Maryland, starin' out the window for motivation
I remember Lil Bobby, Lil B
Man I wish that I could be a dog in a rich family
Oh how nice would that shit be, my life a catastrophe
Now my shit a masterpiece, No Limit like Master P
Now I am the master, see, that's the way it has to be
My life is a movie, I'm so glad God casted me
I am not top ten, more like top three
I am not two 'cause nobody could top me
Get the pussy wet like Jodeci, you know it's me
I can't seem to put my finger on it like a rotary
But somethin's missin' from the game, when I'm gone, oh it's me
I feel sorry for these rappers comin' up, woe is me
I just took a hiatus and wrote a novel, motherfucker
I got more verses than the Holy Bible, motherfucker
'Cause I'm sittin' on five, unreleased albums
Greatest of all time, no lyin', that's the outcome
I do it for the boom bap, the trap and the radio
Fuck a fake fan, steppin' to me, try to play me, ho
I make music for every genre, every occasion
My shit is amazin', I'm blazin', it's insane
Going crazy in the gym, goin' in gains
Had a lot of dark nights, but bitch I been Bane
I was born in the darkness like Rick James, bitch
Sippin' scotch with Chappelle after the Grammys
Said them countries wasn't shit holes, they prolly wanna ban me
'Cause I say the shit that others won't, prolly can't stand me, uh
Like these rappers claim to hate me, but they stan me
I said these rappers claim to hate me, but they motherfuckin' stan me
They hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me
They hate what I represent, but bitch, I am me
There's nothin' but legendary shit that be goin' on, the phenomenon
[Chorus]
You are watching a master– at work
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these lil rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
[Verse 2]
I got my rap and I got my gat
Yeah they got my back, but I won't bust back
Unless I need, this world is greed, I lead by example with ample
Education, my lyricism is here to imprison your vision
The fallacy society has rejected, I'm here to protect it
Everybody di–dies deep within this world we live in, and not everybody tries, but everybody lies
You can't take– money with you when you die so spend it and don't look back like an addict in recovery
But also don't blow it, you know it, don't be a coward, but don't be too heroic
Live your li-life to the fullest, don't push it or pull it
Don't murder others 'cause you disagree with they beliefs
We all the same underneath
I had some shit I had to get off of my chest in that first verse
But this verse come first when it comes to importance of message
(Do what you love, do what you love)
Do what you love, do what you- do it, do it
(Do what you love, do what you love)
Don't do it, don't do it, that's society
(Don't do it, don't do it, do it, do it, do it)
Break free from the cycle, don't be scared to walk like Michael on the moon
RattPack be the platoon, so much more is comin' soon
Yeah I've been goin', I'm already knowin', know Bobby been flowin'
My shit get around like a woman that's hoin'
My body been growin', my mind been growin'
I'm already knowin' that I'm gon' die one day, you gon' die one day, we all 'gon die one day
God already got the date set, so live your life, live yo' life
Yeah you live it, that's a bet, 'cause if you ain't fulfilled in the end
You gon' be filled with regret, bet
[Chorus]
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
You are watching a master at work
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement
This what you all been waitin' for, ain't it?
Rap game owe me, I been waitin' for the payment
All these little rappers come and go, wonder where they went
Ten years and runnin', we came up from the basement

[Verse 1]
Goddamn, goddamn, conversations with people
Crazy how one day, the legends forget that they equal
On this Under Pressure sequel
We not taking it back, we keepin' it pushing
People scared of change
But you'll find me deep in the cushion
Even when I win, it feel like I'm losing
Listening to beats, in the Bimmer cruisin'
I think I got another hit, I could feel my body bruisin'
What's the conclusion? Or rather, my hypothesis
I'm darker than Gotham is
Like reading Nostradamus at 90 degrees
You better believe
I know how to turn a profit with ease
Diacritical lifestyle, I'm always overseas
Hurricane Bobby in the studio blowing trees
Switch the topic, I drop it
Fuck around then leave them all concussed
When I bust, no thrust, this world we livin' in is fucked
Industry rule number four thousand and eighty one
Your new shit ain't good as your old shit
'Til your new shit is your old shit, son
And then some, gotta get some
I wear this 24 karat solid gold Rollie for my son
As an heirloom, not for looking dope as I rhyme
As a representation to give your family your time
If you're searching for love in the industry you'll be let down
They don't love you 'til you dead and then they call you profound
No matter how mainstream you was in the end, you still underground
That's the truth, feeling close to the cliff, like Rick Dalton in the booth
Money ain't the key to happiness and this the proof
Modern day rap is like a golden era spoof
But a few of us were searching within the second renaissance
And I know that my debutantes
Been keeping the legacy going
By flowing so involuntarily seamless
Me and my team is finally reaping
What we been sowing like a seamstress
I said I'm on one, I know I'm unsung
Was livin' my life backward like Tariq on Undun
And now they wonder how I got over son (Do you want more?)
Hell yeah, now check the method
I been livin' outside of pages for ages
Now I'm back, Chocolate City, home of percussion, Maryland on my back
From Takoma Park, all the way to Southeast DC
It feel like forever ago, it feel like BC
Everlasting life, kickin' rhymes in the parking lot at night
Inhale, exhale, people hate
Oh well, 2012
Dreamin' I'm a freshman on XXL
2013, on the cover XXL
Livin' life behind these bars with no intention of postin' bail
'Cause I prevail
But that's a story for another time
Story for another rhyme
And on my darkest days, I know that the sun will shine, eventually
Greatest lyricist to ever do it, yeah essentially
And if we're being modest then potentially
And if we're being humble then...

[Part II]

[Intro]
Oh shit, it's Raquel, she's a fuckin' thot
Ayy, fuck you guys! Fuck you guys!
Suck my dick!
Straight on the basement mic
Ayy, man fuck all these punchlines and shit man
I just wanna tell a story, I just wanna have some fun
Back in the basement type shit
[Verse 2]
Ayo, once upon a time a couple of guys from out this world
Was talkin' rap and hip hop with a young synthetic girl
The year was 2115 at Babel Space Station
Was home to the very last of the human population
The captain name was Thomas, the infantry man was Kai
And he's the man that discovered the Ultra 85
Accompanied by a girl inside their ear, her name was Thalia
Made of ones and zeros, she was a program
You could ask her any question even about the fall of man
Then one day they discovered a planet in deep space
That nobody before them had ever found in they database
I mean, maybe it's the place that's meant for the human race
The planet Paradise, Kai said to Thomas, ""My God
It'd be very nice, traveling through outer space
We done had some scary nights
We done had some scary fights""
All about that rap shit, Kai like that trap shit
Thomas love that boom bap shit
""I wish God was real, I wish I could just get raptured
What if this planet full of aliens and we get captured?""
""Don't think that way, my son
Everything gon' be fine, we finna have some fun
And if by chance we do come across an alien
I'ma blow his ass away with this here molecular gun
Set to kill, never stun
Wagwan, we get it done""
Now the ship is enterin' the atmosphere (Ten, nine)
""We gon' take a look around and get the hell up outta here (Eight, seven)
We gon' double check that it's habitable and livable for man (Six, five)
And no matter what happens you know we gon' stick to the plan"" (Four, three)
""Understood?"" ""Understand"", ""All good? Let's get it then"" (Two, one)
Once they touched down nobody could hear a sound
'Til they opened up the ship door, that rappelled to the ground
What they found, a planet full of life
A planet full of shit they never seen
Straight up out a movie scene
On some Tarantino meets Christopher Nolan, nah mean?
Walk around the planet for hours, they was exhausted
If it wasn't for the music in they ears, they would have lost it
The seventh album by a musician they both revered
First time this planet heard it, let's call it a world premiere
Thomas thinkin' about a picture of his girl
That he left on the Aquarius Three in his dresser
Wishin' he could undress her
Give her the pipe, no lesser
Kai thinkin' nuts like a professor
Wondering if the oxygen on this planet fresher
Now is it us or is the natural life on this world the aggressor?
All the negative shit inside of his head, he need a refresher
Two men here to save the world, no pressure40Embed"

Logic

[Verse]
I got a date with destiny
My heart says yeah, but can’t convince the rest of me
I tried so hard to make it with no recipe
My selfish ways caught up and got the best of me
I need redemption, no need to mention my past
'Cause all that matters now is bigger than diamonds and cash
The glitz, the glamour, the lights, the camera, the action
The stage, the fans, the speakers blastin'
You know I want it; I need it, don’t doubt it, I can’t live without it
This is everything I dreamed of, it’s everything I’ve ever wanted
But is it really truly in my plans
Or did God mix up my blueprints?
Did He have it right there in his hands?
Anybody give me a hint
I can feel it now; I know it’s coming
And I don’t give a fuck what anybody say
I’ve fallen, I’ve risen, I chose and selected this mission
Incarceration, through these bars created a prison
And I intend to do the time that the sentence is given
25 to life, yeah, that’s how I’m living
Sometimes I wonder if I’ll ever make it
But there’s only one way I'ma know
I’m like a seed planted in the dirt
Feels like I’ve been waitin' forever to grow
And maybe today is the day
And maybe tonight is the night
But one thing that I know fo' sho'
This time, I’ma get it right

All these comments got me lost in my mind
All these thoughts that I'm having are not mine
I always post that I'm having a good time
So my life looks perfect online
She say she never done some shit like this before
Suck my dick until I nut and then I go
I want a good girl but I always fuck with hoes
I love drugs, I pop pills, I do blow, blow, blow
I think this girl at the club wants to fuck me
And I really think her boyfriend wants to fuck me up
You're the reason that I'm up all night
You're the reason that I get no sleep
You say my music ain't shit when I creep
Say I should empty the whole bottle in my mouth like Peep
And overdose, immortalize myself
While the media use my death, monetize they wealth
RIP Lil Peep, let that young man sleep
Let that young man death teach
The youth, the streets
To beat addiction
Yeah, that's my diction
Moment of silence
I don't do the Breakfast Club 'cause Charlamagne is shameless
That's the only one I leave out when I run my bases
Do your research 'fore you call somebody homophobic
You make a living off of controversy and you know it
I ain't that type of artist, respect my name and we can talk about it
I'd suck a dick just to prove it ain't that way (Nigga, what?)
Ninety-nine percent don't listen what I say (You gay)

Slap a bitch in the face then I count my wealth

Every bit of it in this motherfucker
Like I'm in the middle of little Italy, a lot of shit was never given to me
That's just a fallacy told by the enemy tryna get ahead of me
They dead to me, everybody dead to me
Everybody know that Bobby will body anybody
Like Gotti did Gambino, from Maryland to Reno
We know Tarantino a killer but the Young Sinatra
Got you by the neck and the spirit the second they hear it
They fear it as soon as they get near it, everybody revere it like

Nobody want to step up in the ring now

Nobody want to step up in the ring now
I sacrificed my twenties now that money ain't a thing now!
Now that money ain't a thing
Everybody talk about my race on socials
Make the boy wanna go postal
Since I went triple plat'
I only identify as bi-coastal
I don't live life like most do (Like most)
Never did the shit I was supposed to

Yeah! Greatest alive, I'm the greatest alive
I'm the greatest at being me, ain't nobody seeing me
So, check it like CMB, that's word to the DMV
I'm straight from the basement, I made it like a villain, I'm hated
Word to Jermaine, this shit just ain't been the same
Never simple and plain like a bullet to the brain
I'm blowing minds, yeah, I gotta kick shit with this rhyme
Second I spit it, so divine, that's word to your mom
Sweeping these rappers up like it's a chore, who want more?
I'll leave anybody two times four
Dropping pounds in London like I lost weight
My mindstate is like a freight when I rhyme, check the state of mind
Yeah, my train of thought is never off the track
When I drive it, so stop it I'm killin' 'em like a virus
After they dead I'm still in 'em, who feelin' 'em, everybody now
It's never nothin' like the first time, nothin' like your first rhyme Nothin' like getting that nut in for the first time
That's the type of shit they never tell you now
Bitches come and go, I know, I know, you can't fuck with this flow
Bobby Tarantino, get the C note, oh yeah, there he go
Tell me they love it, they want it, they need it
I never been defeated, no, never given up
Do what I do, how I do gotta live it up
This shit right here on the real, I can't get enough
God damn, uh, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Went from gettin' close to the gang
To sipping champagne on a plane
Do what you love in life and never second guess it
Even when haters protest it now
You ever wonder what it means to
You ever wonder what it, uh
You ever wonder what it means to finally live in your dreams?
Then realize that everything, it just ain't what it seems?
Uh, yeah, I thought I wanted to be the greatest alive
Until I realized that being the greatest is just a lie
Like the opening words in this verse
That as soon as they disperse, make other rappers converse
And plot to put in you a hearse, real talk, fuck rap
I hate and I love it 'cause it's so negative
Everybody selfish, nobody wanna give
A helping hand to the next man, well, fuck you then
Fuck your ethnicity, we all one
'Cause when my last album dropped, you know we all won
Yeah, that shit went number one, so everybody won

Do the D-A-N-C-E, one, two, three, four, fight
Stick to the B-E-A-T, get ready to ignite
You were such a P-Y-T, catching all the lights
Just easy as A-B-C, that's how you make it right
(You have interfered with our affairs for the last time)
(Sinatra)

[Verse 1]
I am literally in the air, right now, rapping up a stewardess
First class, I am so new at this
Used to ride the metro, now that shit is retro
Like the infrareds on my feet, baby let's go
Sinatra what they know me by, Logic what they call me
Gotta catch a flight but the fans wanna stall me
Life of a don, chain just glowin'
Always in the lab with the fresh kicks on
I'm at the MGM, rocking MCM, Bobby Soxer on my arm it's only 10 PM
Got the RattPack with me going HAM at the hotel
Name brand everything fuck a wholesale
No, I am not materialistic
I was broke my whole life, and no I don't miss it
Last seven years of my life was in a lab
Working everyday giving it everything I had
Now that a brother is finally recognized
I will not let the limelight hypnotize
Everybody be sure, I'mma always want more
Does anybody make real shit anymore?
[Chorus: Justice]
Under the spotlight, neither black nor white
It doesn't matter (Do the dance, do the dance)
As strong as you might, working day and night
Whatever happens (Do the dance, do the dance)

[Verse 2]
The grind never stops, like I'm running from the cops
It's hard to stay humble when you're force-fed props
But I don't give a damn, I am just a man
I am not more important than any one of my fans
First name Bobby so I'm all about The Hundreds
Work so hard, ery'body think I'm blunted (Hah)
Gunning hard with the mask and Glock
And I'ma stay with extra clips 'till the casket drops
Finna blow in the next three years, tops
Talking worldwide, not just hip-hop
Rappers now-a-days so flip-flop
Talking 'bout you, wanna work
Motherfucker kick rocks
I am on the come up, headed to the top
Repping MD, and never will I stop
Me and the crew V's up, Visionary what it do
Step to the mic, lyricism ensues
We go hard, only on campus when I wanna study abroad
Guess that's why they wonder if I go there
All the groupie bitches wanna put they fingers through my hair
Can't fade the thirst, chill out, whoa there
Let me get it, let me bring it back
Haters talking shit but I get richer when they doing that
Yes I am pursuing that, number one album, worldwide
And fuck whoever doubt him (Logic)

Under the spotlight, neither black nor white
It doesn't matter (Do the dance, do the dance)
As strong as you might, working day and night
Whatever happens (Do the dance, do the dance)

Just a little bit

Chillin' with my homies and we vibin’

Life a motherfucker, but we still survivin'

I'm feelin' like Andre pre-3K 'cause all I got is Benjamins
Y’all know the regiment R-A-double-T-P-A-C-K
Rappin' like back in the day, yeah, you heard what I say
From EBT and watchin' BET on my TV to platinum CD
Now I got it like that, the boy brought it like that
Yeah they gon' bring it back
Like the illest sample from the '70s, I'm feelin' heavenly
Grew up in Maryland and now my neighbor is Beverly
Even when Bobby Boy over the hill and he's 70
I'ma be packin' that weaponry, I am the greatest alive
You already know it, I don't gotta say it, this shit is telepathy
If you feel different, then step to me
'Cause I've been ballin, shot-callin'
Droppin' heat back to back while y'all stallin'
Y'all wanna ante up, but I'm all-in
Climbin' the ladder, ain't no way I'm fallin'
Come here, my darlin', married to the game
Come now, feel the pain
But I got a side bitch and that's real
We love to make movies, I told you, that's reel
That's just how I feel
Tell me what I, tell me what I really wanna give for a life like this
No, the boy won't fade away
Take it day-to-day, everybody wanna hate straight-away
That's how we livin' in the world today
I'm Louis, you more C.K.
Was a outcast on the come up back in the day
And now I'm more Andre post-3K, like woo

Ayo, ayo
Fuck you like Cee-Lo, buck it then I reload
Sippin' Pellegrino, shoot the shit like Tarantino (Break it down)
In the cut like Lilo with everybody we know
We all in together like we cousins in the '90s
And if you don't know 'bout that shit
Then you don't know 'bout rap shit, that's jack shit (Yeah)
You ain't got a nickel, son, yeah, I said that's Jack shit
You ain't got a dime dog, you dropped it, that's rat shit
Stab you in the back shit, ratchet
My style is impeccable and nobody could match it
I'm Bruce Wayne terrorizin' Gotham, I'm batshit
I'm Kim Kardashian with a hatchet
Constantly reshapin' this body of work, I'm an introvert
Wonder why I smoke dope, no wonder why I can't cope
(Break it down)
Far from evil, I'm kinda like Spike Spiegel
A cowboy paid for retrieval
Bitches jumpin' to conclusions like Evil Knievel
Best believe you, bitch, I'll leave you stranded
Try to dap me up left-handed
I'll leave you defeated and amputated 'til the blood coagulated
I force the crowd to throw they hands up like cannibals
My God, what a fuckin' animal
Sicker than givin' brain to Hannibal Lecter
You come correct but I come correcter
Food for thought, but hold the lecture
Ayo, I kill the pussy, yeah I make sehctib cremate
I'm an original screenplay in a world full of remakes

Sellin' records on a major label
But I'm still movin' like I'm independent
Still respected like I'm in the pen and
I'm just talkin' my shit so don't get offended
Bitch I been invented this real
Been the same since my deal
If you try to say that I'm changin'
Wait for the album, see how you feel
My third album my Graduation, like Kanye
Music on another level
Yeah, I'm tryna take this shit further beyond 'Ye
I just might fuck around and drop this shit on 'em by surprise
Like I'm Beyoncé
Got a couple million in the bank right now
But I want my zeros beyond Jay
Counting money like Rothenberg PC
Paid a price to be me, ain't it nice to be me?
Ain't it nice to be free?
Do what you want when you wanna do it
On the real, it ain't nothin' to it
Young man on his Alan Watts
In a bookstore with my pocket watch
Wifey, goin' hard with the squats
Life good so they take shots
That's childish, I hate shots
I've been at it, Rattpack, get that shit tatted
Fuck with me on Snapchat
Talk shit and get clapped back
Only carry-on is my backpack
When I jetset like a war vet, what up?

That shit they talkin' beyond fake
Fact I’m right now here beyond fate, uh
I'ma take a minute and get in it so you know I'm in it
This right here is my house, you the tenant
Everything that happens, I intend it
Every word that you hear, I invented
I've been living like a king, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I just been bumpin' that Destroyer ""Girl in a Sling""
That's the type of shit I bring
I'm doin' this for the fans
So they can turn up in my absence
Started a channel
Already made a hundred grand off of AdSense
I ain't do it for the money though
I don't do it for the money though
Shout out to Kid Cudi though

People want to talk about what makes them happy
What really makes you happy?
Tell me what makes you happy
Makes you happy, makes you sad, makes you glad
Tell me what makes you happy
People say its money, give me the money
All the money (money)

[Verse 1]
If I could live forever and a day
Know I'd never fade away
But my life is not okay, I...
I take the bus to my job and one night I got robbed
Life is fucking up my vibe, I...
I wish had a lot of money
Had a lot of dough, had a lot of paper, you already know
My life would be so much better with cheddar
Only work as hard as I do for vendetta
Cause my ninth grade teacher said I wouldn't be shit
Wouldn't be nothing, working that minimum wage
And cooking McMuffins, so I'm puffing on this green
Wishing I had more money than I do
Imagine if I had more money than Erykah Badu, ah!
And so I'm all about my business
Is there anyone who wit this?
Can a brother get a witness like: Ah—Ooh, Ah—Ooh
Wassup with it, come and get it
Tell me now what's on your mind
I ain't talking bout that shit you post up on your timeline
Speak to me in real time, open up and redefine
Open up a motherfucking book for once and read a line
Somebody tell me now what done happen to society
My happiness is gone and it took with it my sobriety
They say that money cannot make you happy
Do not lie to me, whoever said that shit was never broke
And wouldn't try to be, who is you to try with me?
Why you trying me, like ah...
[Interlude]
Now I'mma tell 'em what makes me happy
This what makes me happy, right here
Like this...

Jump up on that MPC, like a boss MVP
Cook up shit that make other producers wanna envy me
Master it then set it free, turn it into MP3s
Spin that shit up in Serato, I can feel the energy

Off the top off the dome

Hella late, feeling good, got a lot on my plate

Real talk, just RattPack, besides that, nobody I trust

[Verse 1: Logic]
Back again like I never left, Young Sinatra, that’s to the death
We turnt up ’til we go deaf, rep RattPack ’til my last breath
I cut records like Kid Cudi, day and night, that’s all the time
From the underground to the mainstream, my same team get all the shine
They wanted beef but I never knew, I just keep the peace and get revenue
Stay true, they never do, cut all ties, I sever you
These rappers like women, that's off of their pill, we keeping it real but they flow is irregular
Grab the mic and I murder on the regular while these bitches hit me up on my cellular
I can’t take the time that I take to rhyme and just bullshit, man, that blow my mind
I’m 23 like MJ, that’s no rest like overtime
Writing rhymes on the tour bus, we stay real to the core of us
They talk shit ’bout RattPack but every day, man, there’s more of us
That money come and that money go, but this music shit, man, that’s all I know
I been broke and I got paid, like a Goodfella that got made
I’m draped up and I’m dripped out, went to school, got kicked out
Told my mama, she flipped out, said “fuck it all” and I dipped out
But I’m back though, whole time, fuck bitches, I just rhyme
Brand new state of mind, my lifestyle is so divine
'Cause I’ve lived and I’ve learned, now I hustle and earn
Cause once you in the limelight, everybody concerned
With your wellbeing, and if you feel okay
Bitch, you wasn’t here a year ago, why are you here today?
I got professor paper, your money need an extension
I’m selling success, save up and pay attention
Money can’t buy happiness, but that shit can support it
'Cause what’s a family of five if you can’t even afford it?
Sinatra

Feeling good, feeling great
Feeling like a XXL Freshman on your bitch ass, nigga

Creeping on the come-up with my nigga Logic, time to get it popping
Got your city watching, hit the stage, them titties popping
What it do? Bruh, I fuck witchu, don’t let these haters knock ya
(Keep it gangsta) Keep it, keep it G, don’t keep them lames around ya
(Fuck the world) Fuck the, fuck the world, y’all gon’ feel my passion
(Pass the blunt) I’ma create that shit that’s fuckin’ everlasting
I’m overboard with the tactics, walk out the house
And I ain’t even matching, but I’m stunting 'cause I’m the coolest and the youngest
I told ‘em I was a threat, they scared of what’s next
I’m Christoper Dorner in effect if you speakin’ down on my name (Pop pop pop pop)
Walking down this road, I’m the only one in my lane
And my fingers getting itchy, that’s that money coming to get me

Wait a minute, ain’t them niggas on the list?
Making moves, making super moves, who the fuck is you?
Nigga what? Nigga, nigga, what? Them niggas the truth
It’s an honor to be a part of the heart of the young Sinatra (Wright)
You ain’t gotta smoke weed, we gon’ celebrate with this vodka (Uh)
Grinding for some time, and I’m hella straight with the dollars
So if you call me and you need me, then I got ya
Don’t talk about being the realest, niggas gon’ feel us regardless
We gotta keep on killing, I got the mind of a martian
I’m spaced out somewhere in a world that I never been
Living out my dreams and I’m still tryna settle in
See it’s amazing, studio sessions (Uh), beautiful blessings (Uh)
I’m faded, usually quiet (Uh), but I’ve got this message (Uh)
So I speak it like I know it
Got my shot, I took it and I didn’t fuckin’ blow it, now everything is in motion
Calling out my homies who understand what it means (Yeah)
To get off your ass, get on your grind and follow your dreams (Yeah)
Making it a fact (Uh) to be great at what you achieve (Yeah)
If I lead, would you follow with a ease? (Uh, uh, yeah)
[Verse 3: Logic]
Open your mind, elevate to the level of this rhyme
Keep it G to the dime, many seek, never find
Never knowing when I’m flowing, feeling heroic, never ask
Chilling with your bitch, I can’t help but grab up on that ass
Swerving at 120 while she’s rolling weed on the dash
Many never follow their dreams but follow the cash
And this is the reason the Reaper is coming for they ass
Top dollar, money, bitches, Impalas, fuck it all, let me holler
And show you how we do it where I come from
We getting money for the long term, not just no lump sum
Uh, how you feeling? Make a killing, bitches higher than the ceiling
I’m Goku, you fuckers is Krillin with the spirit bomb
Fuck around, throw your body on the lawn
Right in front of your mom, motherfuckers, I’m gone

Okay, settle, settle, settle, settle, ladies and gentlemen, settle down
Okay, so, this next brother we're gonna bring up to the stage usually does not come in on Monday nights
You're in for a real treat, ladies and gentlemen
Give it to Mr. Hall

[Verse 1]
Rip out my soul from the depths of my flesh
Flesh from my blood I caress
Right on the page so it's fresh
I take my time, but express
Lot on my mind, but I guess
It's just in my genes like a Glock 17, like a genetic scene
Kick in the door, we blow it off the hinge
Music my drug, tie it off, then inject the syringe
It's in my blood, ain't no need to pretend
Therapist tell me I don't need to defend
Therapy tell me I don't need to explain
Just drop the record on the needle and express my pain
Can't wait until my son shine and together we reign
My queen's by my side like Manhattan
Fuck rapping, this is poetic conviction
My rendition is not meant for your diction
Battled addiction in the womb
A crack baby by definition
Keys to ignition with no permission
That mean that I'm driven
Alive 'cause I'm living
Fuck workin' with what you've been given
I knew I always wanted more like The Roots in nine-five
And I'll be sure to do more for my family than mine did
'Cause hip-hop rhymes taught me more than my moms did
Didn't drink 'til I was twenty-five 'cause I'm my mom's kid
All I knew was alcoholism and prison
Only saw domestic violence and racial division
Social worker trying to take me away
But I know that group home probably worse, hell nah, no way
At least I know my odds here, I'ma be okay
Adapted to the lifestyle, so I'ma be okay
[Interlude]
Keep that one just in case, yeah

[Verse 2]
I'm just an entity
My DNA, not my identity
Finding serenity
Become a better man, I better be
For the child in my baby mama stummy, never crummy
We get big bread
Tryin' to be the greatest, that shit been dead
I'm trying to be the happiest that I can be instead
I'm trying to get ahead like a fetus
Money don't complete us, but it feed us, it can lead us to depression
Being rich is not a blessing, fame is not a blessing
Wasn't 'til I was rich and famous, I learned that lesson
What's the meaning of life, to live it, what I'm guessing

[Verse 3]
Live it, live it
Living life like this is so crazy
Hip-hop is amazing
One day, you're on top and the next, they want to erase 'em
Goddamn, what I'm facing
Every day a new frustration
People thinking I'm complacent
People thinking that I changed like a cashier
But I can't let that register, get the fuck up on out of here
Buy it, break it, roll it, light it, get high as the stratosphere
I can hear the voices in my mind when I rhyme
Give it up, you're out of time
Never even had a prime
Like the Preemo never linked up with 5'9""
Bitch, I'm back like the muscles surrounding my vertebrae
Okay, fuck what you gotta say
I keep it going, already know when I'm flowing
For the listener, you're kind of like a therapist
Or rather Cole in 2005, flowing like Canibus
That throwback shit, yeah, that throwback shit
Fuck what you heard, my catalog, it ain't got no wack shit
'Cause I'm a gladiator in the Colosseum, everybody wanna be him
'Til they feel like they can't be him, then they wanna see him lose
Wrote this poem in navy, that's what I call singing the blues
Word to Dot D, my family got me, no carbon copy
Life can hit you harder than Drago
But if I roll with the punches when it's rocky, don't ever stop me
Never top me, never cocky, I'm never cocky
Okay, well, maybe sometimes
Occasionally in some rhymes
But it's fine, in due time
I'm the illest to ever do it, come now, Bobby Boy, cool it
An indigenous era of the indigenous emcee
Riding this motherfucker 'til the tank on E
What's up?
[Interlude]
(You-you-you-you-you)
(You-you), yeah, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah (Yeah)
Uh, uh, yeah, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
(You-you-you-you-you-you-you)

[Verse 4]
Fuck all the bullshit, dig from deep down inside
I wrote this sitting shotgun in my favorite ride
Reflecting on memories from my childhood
Bringing a baby in this world, I hope my child good
All I ever gave a fuck about was my career
But all that shit out the window now that my son is here
Fuck sales and streams, none of that shit entails dreams
Fuck rap, fuck press, fuck feeling like I'm less
If it ain't 'bout my happiness, then I could give a fuck less
I remember window shopping
Now I'm shopping for windows for my baby new room
Bobby coming soon
And that's the type of line I would've second-guessed
Putting on my shit before
Out of fear that they would hate 'cause they couldn't relate
'Cause it wasn't relevant
Give a fuck if it's evident, this right here is the evidence
I'm like Leo in Revenant, bear with me
You could tear me apart
But that won't take away the fact I wrote this shit from the heart
Where it's built from the start
Where it's finna stay
I've learned every day's a good day
Surrounded by people that love me
Don't want nothing from me but my happiness
Off the internet, that's when I'm at my happiest
Scrolling so much, my thumb fucked up
We call that carpal tunnel vision
Follow me like religion on this course of collision
Feeling imprisoned, and this is my freedom through these lyrics
As I repeat them and beat 'em into my conscience like Adonis
All this lyricism straight to the dome like cocaine through the sinus
I think I finally found my paradise, that's word to Thomas51Embed"

Give me the sample, you know I'ma flip it
Writin' this shit like I'm Lemony Snicket
If she lookin' bad then you know I'ma dick it
I whip it out, then let her lick it
I'm wicked, I'm awesome, I'm icy, I'm flossin'
Literally, shit is literary
I eviscerate any my adversary
When I rolled up, showed up, leave 'em toed up
If you represent, then throw up
Tell me how you really wanna get it
'Cause you motherfuckers better be ready for the moment that I'ma give it
I'm a monster like Nicki, I'm twisted
Don't look away, no you don't want to miss it
I'm glad everybody can listen me spit it
I hit 'em with the brrat like gat, don't miss it
Ayy, bitches, they all on my dick
I know you lovin' this shit
Rappers, they run when I spit
Wait, let me reload the clip
I'm kicking this shit like kung fu, kicking this shit like Cordae do
Kill 'em all, then hit the rendezvous
Killing these beats like Kanye do
Like Yeezus, believe us, my Jesus, I'm ballin'
Top five alive but number one callin'
They say, ""Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, you so busy, so shameless
Hit another level when your ass got famous""
Now they taking shots at the boy but it's aimless
That purple micro, red dot, I'm high and I'm killin' shit
Since 2009, feelin' fine, yeah, I'm still in it
Changin' with the times when I rhyme, people feelin' it like braille
They say, ""Logic different now,"" and I be like, ""Oh well""
I'm rich, I'm healthy, I'm happy, and I'm wealthy
Money like my last name Banks
Bitch, you Geoffrey, bitch, you Geoffrey, like shit
You salty, uh, I said you salty 'cause you sluggish
I made it 'cause I'm me, ain't switch the image like I'm thuggish
I'm ballin' like the Nuggets, they hatin', I'm like, ""Fuck it""

Everywhere we go, people turn to fans
I don't mean to brag but I get the bag, y'all don't see the plan
Pressure, all I smoke is pressure
Million dollars in the bank and fitted on the dresser
And I ain't ever gonna change, I'll stay the same forever
You niggas better play it safe 'til everything is settled
I'm in the new levels, I keep my cool better
Just copped a new crib because the pool better
Just got a private flight, that mean I flew better

I don't know what I’ma do
I don't know where I’ma live
'Cause it feel like I ain't got nothing to give
Just wanna follow my dreams
Just wanna follow my heart
But the world wanna tear me apart right from start
Everything I ever wanted, it ain't what I thought
Bring it back to the roots like my name Black Thought
This shit right here, no it can't be taught
Gotta be learned, it gotta be earned
I ain't got a pocket full of money but I'm full of hope
I don't wanna rob people, I don't wanna push dope
I just wanna live, I just wanna maintain
Like a bullet to the brain
Gotta play the game like a chess board
If yah wanna go to war, gotta bring yah best sword
I feel like I'm going crazy, like I need a psych ward
Think my mind playing tricks on me like a Geto Boy
Feel like I need to murder 'em in the moment I deploy
Everybody, anybody, somebody fill the void, somebody fill the void
Listen, I don't wanna work a job, motherfuck a 9 to 5
Every time I get a check, what I really get? Robbed
Livin in America, this shit is a facade
But you gotta push through and persevere, word to God
Tryna find a home, but I can't afford a home
'Cause I'm 25 and owe a hunnid grand in student loans
Tryna get healthcare, but I'm on welfare
Man I swear to god, I wish I was living in Bel Air
Fuck Medicaid, I just wanna get paid
Wit' a couple bad bitches at the crib, gettin' laid
That's what I'm taught by the media
Television tellin' my vision to get greedier
Come now everybody stay tune like T-Pain
Operate the drive in yah mind like a keychain
Come now folk, get woke, stay woke
'Cause the white man want the black man stay broke
Fuck that, I'm finna buck back
But not wit bullets, I’ma use my education to the fullest
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
I’ma get out of debt, I'ma reset
Do whatever you gotta do whenever to live
But you gotta remember to give back when you get that When you finally get to the top and you hit that pinnacle
I ain't being cynical, I'm just being real
I believe that everybody feel, everybody feel, listen up Everybody over here
I promise to God on everything it ain't nothing to fear Anybody that can hear, just fight
Fight for the right
Fight for ya life
Fight for what you believe is right
Fight for what you believe is right
Everybody fight
Everybody fight
Matter fact, everybody beautiful
But right, what now I need
[Outro]
Black people: to just fight, fight for ya right fight, for ya life
Black people: just fight, fight for the right, fight for ya life
Black people: are beautiful, incredible, amazing
Black people: intelligent, so elegant, it’s crazy
Black people: sit back, just love, and adore

Love's so sharp and flat
That it's hard to know just where you're at

[Verse 1]
From the back to the front door
Dealers on the Southside sellin' on their front door
Little bit of weed, little bit of crack, whatever you need
While I'm sellin' out shows in the ice cold
Shout out to the homies in the front row with the blunt rolled
That waited for hours in the snow just to see me flow
So you know I gotta stay after the show
'Cause if Chi-Town show love, I'ma show love
Outside, no gloves in the wintertime
'Cause I'm hungry like dinnertime
Stayin for every single one of my fans
Autographs 'til I couldn't feel my hands
Just a man with a plan, but you wouldn't understand
I get high by the notes, you get high by the gram (Sinatra)
While you smoke to this, reminisce
When I wrote to this, up-and-comers take note to this
We get it done on tour, waking up before the sundown
Lake Shore Drive shooting videos (Logic)
On the block getting spotted by them city hoes (Hey!)
I know I never had to wonder if it's love or not
Shout-out to the homies up at Jugrnaut
For keeping a motherfucker fresh, hell yes
No contest when it comes to gear in the city they be the best
Love my girls outgoing in my City, Chi
But it's MD till the day I die

We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky
Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry

We get high, oh so high that my mind is in the sky

Shout-out to the Bobby Soxer girls that just love the flow
Chillin out late night with the weed lit blunt split and the paper rolled
RattPack smoking loudpack yeah they 'bout that
Haters talking shit yeah I never doubt that
With the GPS flow we re-route that
Road to riches we be 'bout that
Getting money like Oprah
Fryin' motherfuckers like Okra
Put your L up if you be a smoker
Full-time toker
Everything I got that's what I'm given no division till it's over
Sleeping on the Young Sinatra like a sedative
Now they on a brother's dick, so repetitive
And they wonder why, and they wonder why

Shorties love it when I rub it 'cause I never leave 'em dry

And maybe one day I'll be wiser
'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow, dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be— alright

[Verse 1: Logic]
You ever wonder what it means to make it by any means and finally attain your dreams?
On the come up, where they run up from the world of many fiends
I been at it since a teen, get this money, get the cream
Hard work and sacrifice but not a lot know what I mean
Most these rappers ain't got no class like bomb threats
And bein' ill is a disease, it's the onset
And it don't matter where you at, if you white or if you black
If you rich or you poor, we gon' always want more
But one thing I can be sure, as long as I got the floor
I'ma use this power to paint a picture of unity
And yeah I'm rippin' it up with that energy like it's two of me
Fuck the lights and the cameras, right now it's just you and me

[Refrain 1: Logic & Ryan Tedder]
One day (one day), I'll be richer than I was before
One day (one day), I'm 'gon have enough money to buy the store
One day (one day),
Like Sinatra said you know I'm finna do it my way
You on the road to success, I took the highway

'Cause maybe one day I'll be further from here
Put all of my faith in tomorrow, dark days keep me up all night
Only thing I know, it's gonna be— alright

[Verse 2: Logic]
Feelin' blessed like I'm at mass, yeah, I'm comin' for that ass
Game been broken for too long, so I guess I am the cast
Left my Section 8 crib, finally found some greener grass
So ahead of my time, I wasn't born in the past
This right here a double-header with Logic and Ryan Tedder
Oh no, it can't get no better
And you know, we know we do it for the children
I never thought I'd see the day I made a million
Couple dozen later, feel like everybody feel 'em
I ain't mean to boast in that last line
But countin' money's always been my favorite pastime
Especially with a past like mine
Drugs in the household, never had a hand to hold
Even when I was homeless in the blisterin' cold, but I made it out
And if I can, you can, no doubt, I know—

[Refrain 2: Logic & Ryan Tedder]
(One day) I'ma do it like I never did it
(One day) I'ma have the courage to go out and get it
(One day) Do what I love and support my girl
(One day) I'ma shake up the whole world

And maybe one day I'll be wiser

[Intro: Logic]
Uh
Ayy
Yeah
Are you ready?
Logic

[Verse 1: Logic]
Step into the mind of a young man
And if you don't then I don't really give a damn
All I wanna do is make you understand
But if you don't wanna listen I guess you ain't a part of the plan
Sorry if I digress
All I ever wanted was to be the best
Through lyricism that put your mind to the test
Stayin' up, late night, no rest
Feelin' bulletproof, no vest, but I confess
My mind's a mess, living in a world of stress I digest
But I gotta keep grinding
'Cause everyday success what I'm finding
And I don't give a damn if you hate on me
'Cause when I blow what you gon' say homie?
Heh, not a goddamn thing
But that's enough of that, I'ma let my home girl sing
[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Logic]
All I think about is music
Don't get me wrong I think
About other things but this is how I fuse it
So the whole wide world can use it
When you feel like you just might lose it
Take a breath, homie, don't confuse it
Take a step in the mind of Logic
As long as you don't abuse it
So let me break it down for the whole world
Like I broke it down for my old girl
I can't deal with your bullshit
No more, gotta let it go, let it unfurl
'Cause I remember the time
When I was living sublime, wanted to make a living off of my rhymes
But the whole world told me never mind
I'm a star, how could I not shine?
[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
[Verse 3: Logic]
I just wanna take it to another level
That I never even been on so I can sit on
Every single piece of paper that I put a pen on
And when I been on for like ten years
I'ma do it better than anybody before me
So the whole wide world will adore me, ain't no need to assure me
And if you wonder why I'm rapping so fast
It's 'cause I gotta lot of things on my mind
That wanna come out at the same time
In other words I'm racin'
I used to pursue my dreams
But now they're reality and that's what I'm chasin'
Why are we on this Earth?
Why must we feel pain?
Why does everybody feel the need
To judge one another when we're all the same?
[Chorus: Camille Michelle Gray]
Knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)
You might be knocked down, round for round
You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
When will the fantasy end? (Yeah)
When will the heaven begin? (Yeah)45Embed"

Is it still, is it going? (Yeah yeah)
(Alright) So we gon’ do this one like for the RattPack and shit, is it recording?
Alright for the real hip-hop mothafuckas, you know what I’m sayin'?
(Yeah yeah) Shout out to Bobby, my engineer
It’s a nice night in L.A
We're recordin' this mixtape and shit, workin' on the album at the same time, you know what I’m sayin'?
Visionary boy
Yeah yeah, uh, yeah, we gon’ do it for 96’ (yeah)
We gon’ do it for hip-hop (yeah second renaissance type shit check it)

[Verse 1]
Who would have thought that painting pictures ’bout being broke
Would get me riches like dealing coke?
Like big brother used to do so we could stay afloat
I heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would tote
Thought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote
While they was firing, you could hear sirens
From people dialing 911 crying in the phone
I was in the zone, trying to make a living
Heading to work in the morning
Everyday felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased
Until I quit my job, then my work ethic increased
Elevated to levels I ain’t ever seen
Stacking this cream, living the American dream now
I’m going crazy, I ain’t slept in days
Dreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J’s
Always shouting out my team ’cause I get all the praise
But they the ones that motivate me on depressing days
See I’m from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation
From the smallest altercation, that can lead to termination
With a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation
Passing bars back and forth like legal examinations
As a youngin I was running wild
Me and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud
Doing shit just to do it, ’cause we wasn’t allowed
I thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah
Now when my mama was at home drinking, thinking ’bout the bills
I was dreaming ’bout the mills, running round looking for thrills
I guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page
And paints a picture of another age
Back in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark
‘Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down
‘Til we get older and hustle, now they try’na gun us down
We just trying to make a living off of what we’ve been given
Wassup
[Hook]
Walk on by
Walk on by
Walk on

[Verse 2]
They call me Logic, yeah that’s L-O-G-I-C
I ain’t wrapped up in them bitches, I just write ’bout shit I see
‘Cause these lyrics set me free, fuck the world, let me be
And when I feel like I can’t write, that’s when I hit the MPC
My talent limitless, but time is limited so listen up
If you can’t see the shit I see, you better get your vision up
I’m the king, watch me reign, born to rule my domain
Album ain’t even in stores, they tryna sue me for my name
Shit insane, so berserk, never complained, I just work
Chasing after my dreams like them high school skirts
Back as a youngin, spitting game, tryna get the nut in
Living life to the fullest ’cause them little things ain’t nothing
My flow unkillable when I be murdering syllables
But I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme
Perfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb
I be rapping ’til I’m dying, doing everything I love
That’s the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor
Tryna get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed
That’s the type of shit I need
Lyrics bleed from my mind state
Elevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate
‘Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low
And sometimes I do shit I thought I'd never do before
My life is like a movie role that’s starring me, got these women on me
I hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me
At the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot
Pretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips
Both my hands on her hips, ’til she put 'em on her tits
Freak bitch want the dick, biting on her finger tip
I only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit
I’m thinking ’bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wildin' out
But that pussy wet as hell, I think it’s time to end the drought
Then again she could be burning, and that’s not what I’m about
So I dipped out, to live another day and die another night
‘Cause when I’m gone that ain’t gon' be the song that they recite
What up?

Make a couple platinum records in that bitch and then I dip up out it

Talkin' 'bout, ""You gotta get home, feed your son,"" girl, don't trip about it
Walk up in with apple sauce and broccoli
Little Bobby, better eat your greens, boy, don't give me lip about it

[Verse 1]
I'm a dad, this my life
This the type of shit I write
I was hungry in the basement, now that boy, he full of life
Smoking dope, high as a kite
Only when that babysitter at the crib, though
Take my shorty to Nobu and dig up in her rib though, ayy, yeah
(Take my shorty to Nobu and dig up in her rib though, yeah)
'Cause back in my day it was food stamps
And I love my wife like I am Chance
I bet you'd rap about the shit me and him rap about
If you had ever made it out, but you ain't never had the chance
Uh, uh, circumstance
Uh, uh, way of life
Uh, uh, my decisions
Uh, uh, made 'em right

[Verse 2]
I've upgraded while they waited, will they love it, will they hate it?
Who gives a fuck though?
Rappers praying they next, this shit is cutthroat
I'm livin' on another planet
My manic depression make me constantly wanna panic
I'm stressing on stage, pretendin' everybody undressing
I think I'll never learn my lesson, but fuck it all, it doesn't matter
Ayo, I'm on a lyrical, poetic rhetoric
Lyrical miracle, satirical shit
If you don't like my conscious rap, you won't like my material shit
Love him or hate him, everybody know Logic can spit
Used to be up to date on that rap political shit
But nowadays I'm up to my elbows
And every single inch of my body in my baby's shit
I could tell you more about diapers than modern rappers in cyphers
I used to be about the B-Rabbits and Mekhi Phifers
Hit the stage, grip the mic and murder you like a pro-lifer
But I'm done now, I got a son now
Fuck the rap game, I'm done now

[Verse 3]
They say that that boy done changed
He don't rap about his everyday life, he ain't the same
Goddamn, already had a hard life once
Am I supposed to recreate it every album for you cunts? Okay
You want to hear about my everyday
I wake up, I wake my son up, then I feed him
And lead him into his car seat
Drive up the street down to Target
Don't do hard drugs or beat my wife
But the paparazzi still wanna start shit
I don't answer their questions, I leave 'em in the dark, bitch
Then I walk through the automatic doors
A couple fans spot me but, shit, I ain't on tour
I ain't trying to ignore her
But I head to aisle four 'cause my drawers stank as fuck
And I need some new drawers
Then I spot some more fans, stan hella hardcore (Can I have a picture?)
Asking for a pic and I say sure
Scratch my dick and shake his hand
Shaking uncontrollably, he tells me I'm the man
Now I'm headed to aisle three for some Bounty paper towels
I also grab some wet wipes to clean the shit from my bowels
A really hot girl walks by with a fat ass
But I'm just wondering if Hefty really holds the most trash
Forgot my card at home, thank God I brought some cash
Then I grab some Preparation H for the critics up my ass
Head to aisle five for some Sgt. Smash cereal
Is this want you wanted, everyday life material?
I'm not a kid anymore and be sure shit's boring
Made it out the basement, now my bank account soaring
Most exciting part of my life is probably touring
Don't get me wrong, I love fans in every single city
But hotels suck and the internet is shitty
I mean, why rap about everyday shit
When I could murder punch lines and sound dope like this?

Paper chasin' on occasion
West Deer Park, that's my location
Life and death what we was facin'
Boy, gotta get that motivation
Back in the basement
Look at my idols, I'm feelin' adjacent
Doin' the shit that I wish I was doing, I'm feelin' impatient
Throwin' parties and catching cases
That's the life, but that shit basic
I've cooked crack, I can't erase it
If I could, would not replace it
Grew up all alone
Had to teach myself to tie my laces
What's the deal?
I'ma play the field
Rattpack, we keep it real
Nothin' but love for the people that paved the way
So a brother like me, he can get it today
Antoine, Erykah and 3K
Can't forget those ain't here today
R.I.P. JD and Pimp C
Payin' respect, so don't hold it against me
Devil he callin' me, he love to tempt me
God exempt me, why you sent me here?
What I think about year to year
What I've been through these people only see through a peephole, yeah
Not a single one got an idea
So I write it down on this page
Feel like I'm 35 times my age
Look in the mirror don't know what to say
But I'm happy the man I is
[Verse 2]
Yeah, yeah
I said I'm happy the man I is
And I'm proud of the man I've become
I'm proud that I'm from a slum
And never got cold, I never got numb
Except for the wintertime and then some
I transcend and I transform
Poetic vision in rare form
Growing up, nobody there for him
I promise when I have a family I'ma be there for 'em
I love hip-hop
Hatin' motherfucker, go kick rocks
No matter what happen I never gon' stop
Like Cole said, if they don't know yo' dreams
Then they can't shoot 'em down
But I'ma let the world know
'Cause I'm too high up to hit the ground
This shit right here is like therapy, spit it verily
I ain't perfect, I got problems, I got issues like People magazine
Shoot from the hip and reload the magazine
I wish I could just go on forever, forever, ever and ever
But this rhyme
Ill as it is divine
Gon' be cut short today 'cause I'm out of studio time
Only thought I was recording these horns and not no rhyme
What can I say? Inspiration hits at any time
So I guess I'll have to conclude all my thoughts another time
Another rhyme
Another— Ano— i— wo— a— rhyme

I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd

[Verse 1]
Come on, baby girl, tell me what you want, I got what you need
Said she independent, so don’t get offended if she leave
I said I won’t get offended, I’ll just get some Fendi
And repress my emotions in material shit that can be a distraction
Pussy and money, sometimes I feel the satisfaction
Till I spend that bread and bust that nut and now I’m back, son
After the damage is done
Rearrange the game and let 'em know your name

[Chorus]
Right now
All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
""Sinatra""
[Verse 2]
You know the drill, come on, you know the deal
If my shorty acting up, I wife swap like Uncle Phil
Moving at the speed of sound, let’s slow it down and keep it trill
Yeah, we keep it real, kill 'em with kindness and not the steel
Yeah, we livin' it up, you know that this is my everything, I’m never givin' it up
All the time, all the—all the time (yeah, we do)
And now I feel like I wanna keep going, my cards never showing, don’t know what’s in-hand
I love my fans, but this here girl want me, tell me I’m the man, I know I am
But never acknowledge it
Touring the country, I'm loving these colleges
Touching more pussy than a gynecologist
Study her body like I’m a biologist, with no apology
Baby girl, follow me
She got low, blow my kiss of criminology
And she be loving the way I be flowing
And I know the infatuation is growing
If you catchin' feelings you better be slowin' it down
(""Slowin' it dow—"") slow it down, down
'Cause we both know what happens when that love come around
You feelin' me, I’m feelin' you, I want you to be mine
Maybe one day it will be, but I don’t have the time

[Chorus]
Right now
All these motherfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
I’m 'bout to get it right now
All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
[Verse 3]
Shorty say she love me and she know every word
To every song on every mixtape
""When your album droppin'? Tell me which date
Everything you say to me, I can relate
The fact that we met right here, right now on this night, it must be fate""
Now I’ll be damned, time moves so fast
Couple months back, I had a meeting with my last
Reminiscing 'bout love, discussing matters of the past
Looking in them eyes, but I’m thinking 'bout that ass
I took her for coffee, she took me for granted
Now I show no emotion and my shorty can't stand it
And now you know (And now you know)
I’m on my grind, I keep my exes in line like tic-tac-toe
And I finally got 'em all up out my vision
However, I’m all they see when they turn on the television

[Chorus]
Right now
All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd
Right now
All these muhfuckers wonder how
All the pretty girls love the style
And they wonder if he well endowed
On stage tryna feel my dick from the crowd (""Sinatra"")39Embed"

Seem like my whole life changed in the last year
At parties with legends like ""What the fuck I’m doing here?""
Waiting for someone to say ""What the fuck you doing here?""
Until I realized I belonged and had nothing to fear
Who would’ve thought I would mingle with celebrity singles
In a room full of Grammy winners discussing they singles
Some people love you, some people hate you
Some people need you, some people act like they know you
But they can’t even read you
The effort I put into music is still the same amount
'Cause ain't a damn thing changed except the bank account
I remember the day I got my advance money
I’m talkin' so much bread, this shit'll make you dance money
What's the first thing I did?
Got my team out the way and then I got myself a crib
My boy Lenny gave me a place to stay for a year
Put food in my stomach, I had nothing to fear
And once that 365 was up, I told him to quit his job
And gave him a new career
So many rappers on that stupid superstar shit
But I plan to eat with the people I starved with
I’ve made money, I’ve lost money, I’ve spent money
I've slept outside due to lack of the rent money
I’ve been in love, been happy, been through a lot of pain
'Cause what the fuck is sunshine without a little rain?
And love is like leaves in the fall
'Cause some people get scared and leave when you fall
Speaking of which, I met this girl the other day
The type of girl that make the pain fade away
And I have a feeling she gon' be my next
'Cause she make me forget all about my ex
I’m talking something that’s deeper than just sex
But I don’t want her to be the third letter in the word next
Old soul in the sea of love
I’m just not current, none of the above
And man, fuck all that depressing shit
Let’s get this money and fuck these bitches
You know what I’m sayin?
Sike, nah, all of y'all just know that I’m playin'
'Cause all the money you possess ain’t what makes you a man
Big shot, tough guy, blow 100 grand
But you still in the same place, damn
But man, the world is so fascinating
Ambition got these girls gravitating
And honestly, it strokes the ego
But beautiful women ain’t good for nothing
Except procrastinating
I got a show in Paris coming up
Followed by London, I'ma tear it up
So many people just don’t care enough
Analyzing faces in the crowd staring up
What's the difference between me and them?
How come I ain’t in the crowd at they show seeing them
What that guy see in me that he ain’t see in him?
'Cause honestly I see no difference between me and him
We all people, all equal, we all the same?
Lookin' for control tryna play the game
We all got issues, just different magazines
We all sleep but have different dreams
However, once you’re awake and your life ain’t what it seems
And that’s the reason I’m living within my own dream
Hell yeah, fuck 'em all like I’m runnin' from the law
Haters probably think they phase me, I’m like no, not at all
I’m too high up, now to fall
Like a sphere, bitch I ball
Never asked me where my team at
'Cause you know I brought em all
And if you’re looking for a problem then we can get it solved
I just kill them with kindness, keep it peace and it dissolve
You got bitches, I got Bobby Soxer girls that be ride or die
A shawty on another level, let me catch a vibe
Super bad girl, IQ is in the sky
She graduated cum laude, your bitch went to DeVry
God damn, oh girl, she a go getta
At the party takin' shots like a Beretta
Doing anything and everything to feel better
And now she in the crib getting high like a falsetto
How you feeling, I be yelling
""Why these motherfuckers grilling?""
And she give me life ‘cause I’m making a killing
Bring it down, do it slow, show me how that really go
Girl I’m new in town, I don’t really know
They be like, when you gonna tell me that you love me?
I be like, ""Bitch I gotta hit the studio, ho""
Now she got me on the crib, talkin' that she wanna do it
Condom on the dresser looking at me like ain't nothing to it
Thinking should I do it though, I don't even know the ho
I don't even know the ho, I don't even know the ho
[Outro: Elijah Blake]
Sayin', ""Ohh, mama I made it""
Ohh, mama, I made it
You cannot tell me no
But the young boy made a way
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I said, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh20Embed"
