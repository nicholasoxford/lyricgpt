Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
Come again?
If you cannot stay down
Then you do not have to pretend
Like there is no way out
I shoulda never let you in
'Cause you got me face down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And don't take this personal
But you're the worst
You know what you've done to me
And although it hurts, I know
I just can't keep runnin' away
(I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away)

[Chorus]
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you
[Verse 2]
Tell me whatcha say now
Tell me whatcha say?
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up?
So uninvited then
Just change my mind like that

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
'Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That I've been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' away
(I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away
I can't keep runnin' away)

[Chorus]
(But I don't need you)
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
(But I) But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you (It's lost in hope, aye-aye)
[Verse 3]
Everybody's like ""He's no item""
""Please don't like him""
""He don't wife 'em""
""He one nights 'em""
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
Then tell you the truth, wish we never did it
'Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
(God damn) God damn, baby, my mind's blown
Be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And, yeah, I know what you did
But, baby, I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind of shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
[Bridge]
In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

[Outro]
And though I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I still want you (Oh)
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I, but I love you
I don't need you, I don't need you
I don't need you, I don't need you
But I want you
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I love you931Embed"

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
We do not exist in
Any other instant
Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be
I have waited lifetimes to find you
Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreaming
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You've probably been waiting forever
So how does it sound:
Us on the ground
Giving you my love?

[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me find your spot with the warning that I might slip
And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on me like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it, tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And, yeah, it's obvious momma now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (Mmm), we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I wish you good luck on the seats thats inside this Porsche

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko and Kendrick Lamar]
Come to me, come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me
[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience only cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million times
I wrote a million rhymes describing your star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours
[Hook 1: Jhene Aiko]
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]

Gotta get yours like, right now

I been through some shit man
But I be on my shit man
I decided
That what you give
Is what you're given
So I been tryna do it right
I been doin' like
Whatever gets me through the night
What a life
I'm steady always on the go
You steady always on the go
We steady losing all control

[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
They say
The truth ain't pretty
But coming from that pretty mouth
The truth is fitting
'Cause you ain't never talkin' loud
And you know plenty
Yeah, you know what I'm talkin' bout
'Cause you just get me
Yeah, you so pretty
If everything is dipped in gold
Then, baby, it will never grow
Everything sweet ain't sugar coated

One, two, one two…
Thought I told you not to trust these hoes
Say they love you, when you know they don’t
Say they will, but shit, you know they won’t
Yeah, you hear me, you don’t feel me, though
And you are not the only one…
You are not the only one…
You are not the only one…
You are not the only one…
Okay, fuck it
It was Dominik, David, Braden
All of them did the same to you
Marquis and Sean and Brian
All of them had they way with you
Ever so often you get lost and miss out on everything
Shout-out to Krissy
That’s my bitch ’cause she tells me everything
And I was not the only one
I was not the only one to you…
So I was the only lonely one…

Really, we had the perfect end…
That night we shared at the Comfort Inn…
We made love like the world would have ended…
If either of us had admitted..
We were in love…
So I was the only one…
And I should’ve never took you on a boat for your birthday
And I should’ve never fucked you on a boat on your birthday
And I never would’ve came into your house in the first place
If I would’ve known that you would hurt me like in the worst way
‘Cause that night turned into every weekend and
Every weekend turned to every evening
You took me out and left me in the deep end then
Quis found out and then I had to leave him
‘Cus I couldn’t be the one to hurt him
Plus I thought you were the one so it was worth it
But really we should’ve just ended it
That day I was at your crib when...
Your baby mama just burst in,damn

I was weak then and you knew it
I was so weak then and you proved it

[PART II]
‘Cus my brother was dying
And you gave me a shoulder to cry on
It was nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing
If it's nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing, it’s nothing
Then why’d you...
Then why’d you call it love?
Oh oh
And I was not only one who was hurting
And you were not the only one with the burdens
But if we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing, we’re nothing
Why would you call this love when you knew that it wasn’t?
Why would you call it love when you knew that it wasn’t?
If this was not love then please tell me what was it
If this was not love then please tell me what was it

‘Cause when I met you at my favorite store
And I saw you working at the door ....217Embed"

Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say bout 2:30 mid day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away

And then you'd give me my space

Lets get faded
Gotta call your job tell em' you won't make it

It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, (haha, on my sleeve)
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say ""guess what?"" (What? What?)
Reading stories to some other nigga kid
And I wonder why I'm all messed up (up up up up)
Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, once soul, two halves
No joke, who laughs?
Just us (Just us, just us)
[Verse 4: Jhene Aiko]
Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way

Is it hot in here or is it just me?

Told 'em, ""Go on, take a shot on three""
Told 'em, ""Drinks is on me""
Yeah, the drinks are on me

Only drug a bitch is on is the tree
But I lasted ten rounds like a freak

Baby, that ain't right
I wanna be there with you
I really do be missing you
Everything I do is for you
And I really do adore you
You're getting so big now
And you're making me so proud

So every single little moment
I can't be there to hold your hand
I need for you to know that

'Cause anything could, if anything should happen
Know that you'll be alright, know that you'll be alright

This verse starts as my snipers hit their marks
And your guards fall down from a rifle to the heart
Like, clap, clap, let em fall slow
I know you had your fears, you can let 'em all go
And most women are motivated so I act accordingly
But this is so refreshing that it means a little more to me
Dedicating time when I really can’t afford to be
I provide protection if you open up the door for me
Couple stares, couple texts, couple dates
Couple ""I think that we’re ready""s
Couple ""I think that we should wait""s
Are we actin' like a couple? I’m just tryna get it straight
Cause I’m over here convinced that it’s too early for mistakes

Why, it’s just not our season
The one and only reason
Baby oh, baby oh

Damn, tell me where did all the magic go
I followed the rules and told you everything you had to know
Had you over every night, every night was passionate
Plus, you met my mother even if it was an accident
I’m confused tell me where we go wrong
I was sure that I would be with you for so long
I was planning on this on being something worth mentioning
Energy invested in someone I saw potential in
Who killed chivalry? They need to get their sentencin'
Meanwhile we arguing and I can’t get a sentence in
And just as I predicted here we go again
They always say the hottest love has the coldest end

Wasn't meant for you
Hope I set the ship right

It may just well be the ending

Until you couldn't take the tension

Walkin' through the smoke and mirrors
Burdened, you burning bridges
Memories fading faded it help you not to remember
The trials and tribulations, eyes red from cryin'
The perfect way to disguise it you was blinded by our fate
Please don't rain on my parade 'cause this float was built for you
Kinda hard to chase you down when you floatin' through the room

I glimpse with a squint but I can see a whole grip
My retinas red, my vision is crystal
Didn't use pencil but it's true I led
My way to this sedated state of mind I always tread
My daddy did it this is the state of mind I always had
I'm mad he died before we got to have a man to man

So I take a deep breath, Puff, puff, pass

That we've been searching for all through the night
Just tell me it will be alright
'Cause, baby, in a world full of cancer
Where everyone needs a ransom
My mama said ""love is the answer""
So when I call you better answer me
Right now I need you here on me
No substitutes, you're the one and only
Please take away the stress I don't need
You got me on my knees, baby, James Brown, please

Both got a past full of sorrow
Let's cancel everything tomorrow

The future, that's a mystery
The present, that's a gift, that's why they call it the present
I can't watch the news lately, it's been too depressing
I'd rather be with you, bodies pressing and decompressing
So much smoke in the air, it's like we need decongestant
I know you need protection
I tell you what to do whenever you need direction
You know I'm overworkin', and I cut the check like director
Take me daily, as directed
'Cause, baby, in a room full of dancers
You still are the answer
These other hoes nothing to focus on
I need somebody real to get close up on
Looking for someone who don't annoy you when they overstaying

I could put you to sleep faster than melatonin
Us zoning, wishing I could freeze-frame the moment

[Verse 1]
I'm so, glad you, called right on time
You must have just read my mind
If we skipped the small talk
Want you now
But, I don't have to stay til mornin'
I don't have to, I don't have to pack no clothes
I am really not that lonely
We finished, we finished and I will go

[Hook]
It's whatever you want
I wanna please you most
Whatever, whatever turns you on, oh
Just let me know
You are so creative
The way that you're makin'
Love to me, you do me
Like no one's ever done it
That is why I want it all the time
I don't want your heart
Or your love
Just, do what you do to my body
I, just wanna - that is all I want
[Verse 2]
If these walls could talk
They'd say, ""Pick me up, and put me on'em""
This bed's way too soft
It's time to get off, but keep it goin'
Keep it comin', keep me cummin'
Make me want it, don't you want it? Do you love it?
How you want it? Where you want it? Where we goin'?
Oh, living room floor, ohhh

[Hook]
It's whatever you want
I wanna please you most
Whatever, whatever turns you on, oh
Just let me know

That is all I want

Not your love, not your heart
I just want you to start
And do what you do to my body

Go figure
You were the trigger
You brought me to an obstructed view
When you knew the picture was bigger
Who am I kiddin'?
Knew from the beginning
You'd ruin everything, you do it every time
You are my enemy, you are no friend of mine, muhfucker

You muhfuckin' right, I'm bitter
You muhfuckin' right, I'm triggered
You muhfuckin' right, I...

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
Wanna fuck you right now
I just turned the lights out now
And you know when the sun go down
That's when it would all go down
Been a minute, been a while
Ain't let nobody hit it since you hit it
You know you always know what to do wit' it
But ain't no me and you without you in it
Damn, I'm 'bout to burn this bitch down
I think I need to lie down
'Cause I'm not tryna wild out now
But right now
Don't know what I'm capable of
[Verse 3: Jhené Aiko]
Might fuck around and go crazy on cuz
Might fuck around, have to pay me in blood
This ain't the way that you want it
Might catch a case in this bitch
Don't let me catch you face-to-face in this bitch
Tryin' my hardest not to disrespect you
After what you did, man, what you expected?
You muhfucker

[Verse 4: 21 Savage]
I was triggered when I seen you with that scrub (On God)
He can't handle you, you know you need a thug (Straight up)
They said never wife a woman that you meet inside a club
But I slept with half the club, baby, who am I to judge?
I went against the world when they changed you (21)
I was ready to go to war when it pertain to you (On God)
How you leave a real nigga for a lame dude? (Straight up)
I did things with that pussy that he can't do (On God)
The way I lick it, the way I used to hit it
Sucking on that clit so long I left a hickey
Made her cut a hole in her Vickies for the quickies
Then she hit a pawn shop to buy me all the blickies
Thinking 'bout the faces that you made when I would hit it
That you prolly making with another nigga, got me trippin' (21)
Man, you got me triggered, got me in my feelings
If I see him now, up this bitch and get to clickin' (21)
[Verse 5: Summer Walker & Jhené Aiko]
First thing that I gotta do, I gotta go remove my tattoos
I gotta get up out of this place
I, I can't stand to look at your face
I know that I always get big mad
I cannot believe I did that
Nobody gets me so fired up
Nobody gets me so fired up
I tried little 'till I thought I died inside
I, I want to take it easy on me
'Cause when I get mad I get big mad
Shoulda never did that, get back
'Bout to feel the wrath of a menace
In my bag, in my feelings
I'm a bad little bitch, you know

""I shoulda saw she was see through"" or ""He was evil"", like
""I wasted my good experience with these people"", like

So only half that memory's worthwhile
We had beef but at least there's a birth of a child
Cooled and flipped it, reminiscing bad times with good people's terrific
Beautifully different 'cause we still kick it
You said we can't be intimate, you said we can't go there
If this thing is going nowhere, it's so weird
Now it's cold, thought I had control, thought I took your soul
Nah, I took your mind, engraved my name

How many soulmates we get in this lifetime?
Right now's the right time, you the wife kind

Thought I could get you to be mine
Memories sinkin', deep in, leakin' in my mine
All of the time I can't forget to
Try to forget you in my mine

[Verse 1]
Pretending I have the patience
Pretending there is enough time for waiting
Remembering when we kept it all basic
I wanna go back so bad I can taste it
What do I care for?
You are not there anymore
I was not careful
That is all your fault
You let me fall

Buried alive here inside a nightmare
Living a life where you're gone
There is no light here
It will be light-years until my mind's clear
I did it all for love
I did it all
I'd trade it all for you
I'd trade it all
But what do I care for?
What are you here for?
If you're not there when I call?
I was not careful
And that's all your fault
You let me fall

Remember when it be just me and you in your crib smoking tree
Like you took control of me
And you had a hold of me
Had me so gone, baby, yeah, you had me giving me all of me

Attention is expensive to pay
I can't get by on minimum wage
Been dealing with this venomous rage
Since I was under the age
I've been under the influence of pain

Never needed no one
No, I don't need nobody, nobody, nobody
I don't need no one, shit, I don't need no one

Fucking up my chakras again
My father is a doctor, I've been talking to him
All the shit I'm taking could've got it from him
I don't have no patience, prolly got it from him
Just a product of him
Pop one, pop two, pop three, four pills
These things tell me how life should feel
Fuck yeah, fuck you, it's my free will
Please don't tell me to chill

'Cause I don't need nobody
I don't need no one, I don't need no one
No, I don't need nobody, nobody, nobody

No one ever listened, no one called me pretty
Grampy called me Penny, I think I am worthless
I don't have a purpose
Who am I enough for?
Why we always lose what we work for?
Why we hurt more?
Why we never see my mother cry?
She's so tough for us, poor her

(Take this) tiny bursts of optimism in them
(Take this) I'm reversing my decision to win
(Take this) take this, take this, take

Then life had just begun
(Take this) it is '89 now, everything is fine now
I am only one

I'ma be a mother, wow
(Take this) 2012 summer, it just got tougher
I don't have my brother now
Take this, take six, take pics, faces, famous
Face it, fake shit, pain is faithless
Yes, I am aware I am tripping
I'm here in this hell that I don't wanna live in
I smoke on my own, I drink on my own
I know it's wrong
To people I know, they just wanna know what's going on
I can't tell a soul, no, I can't tell no one

You landed on the window of pain, simple and plain
It's hard for you to fly in the rain
The way love goes is not the way that it came
Come fly, un-die, be born again
I've seen the strongest of them be torn from men
Ripped apart and get put back together
Them the ones with the most beautiful feathers

With the need to be as simple
As her makers and the made up things she dreamed
Falling from high buildings 'til she
Was numb to the feeling really

Earth opened up, swallowing her
Off the grid and into paradise, her whole life

Was needed to fulfill the prophecy

Though if they would, she could free them
From the truth that they've been told a lie, their whole life

Used to be so different you were not this type of guy
Always set aside all your extra pride
Then you started tripping different bitches on the side
And I am not surprised, no I am not surprised
You always demanded things that I could not supply
And I could not survive
If you don't have survival, then I cannot take that ride

Bringing me back down, he's checking my background

I wouldn't have so many imaginary friends
I’m spaced out, dog, I be on that moon talk
Wonder if God asked Mike how to moonwalk
I swear to momma, wish me and my father talked more
I stopped visiting around the time I was a sophomore

How you like it up there?
What's your view from there?
I bet it's so cool to jet across the moon
That's how I picture you in my head
Can't get outta my bed ever since you had left
Don't got nothin' left, walkin' 'round half dead
Still, have faith, half baked
We were halfway to Hana
We did some shrooms and we smoked marijuana
Came all this way to escape all our problems
Came all this way just to break every promise and do
Everything you said I shouldn't do
But those things bring me closer to you, yeah
So the other night, I
Took a tiny piece of paper and put it under my tongue
This white guy said it'd be fun, and it was, but
What I saw
Oh my God, oh my God10Embed"

You want that fat eighth or a little eighth?

Get out my pockets homie, let me just get a regular eighth
Alright well, come on in, don't touch nothin’ either
Smell this, this is, I just got this right here from Cambodia, it's a Cambodia Crispy
This ain't no Cambodia Crispy
Look, man, okay, I’ma be honest, that's really CBD
Just give me thirty-seven dollars and you can have that

If I could fly
I would probably never come down
With all of the bullshit confusion on the ground
I wish that I was high
'Cause I can't live my life when it's low
So I'm gonna call the bros
Tell 'em, ""Roll up one, right now""
I'm tryna smoke

That's why lately I've been smokin' on gas (Smokin' on gas)

That everyone has a gun they're always at war
I told him where I reside

Been thinking about the baby that we almost had
Thought I moved on but I didn't
Like, who am I kidding?
Shit it's all been bad
He threw a party, yeah he threw a party
Remember Marvin when he threw a party
We went to his room and shit got retarted
Hate that I used no protection I'm sorry
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
I think that something was slipped in my drink
I know you're thinking how dumb can I be
Shouldn't been there anyway, I'm ashamed
That night was my first time trying cocaine
After we split up, nothing's been the same
I've been caught up living in the fast lane
It's been two months and I'm scared cause I'm late

Emotions are mixed up
I am just a crazy girl
I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to be my savior
Could it be you?

You cannot fight fire with fire
An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind and
We are all slaves of desire
Controlled by the things we think that we need
No, not trying to preach to the choir
Cause I’m just a girl born unto this world but
I am no god or messiah
But here’s what I know

[Hook x2]

Everything must go
Like everything you know, forget about it
Everything must go
Like everything you think you know

[Verse 2]

After the fire
We each have one sweatsuit and one pair of shoes
No, nothing designer
But smile anyway cause my mama said that happiness comes from within so
What you create for you, no one can take from you
Your energy and your soul
Is all that goes, wherever we go
[Hook/Outro]

Everything else don’t
Like everything you own, forget about it
Everything must go
Like everything you think you know

Can’t take it with you when we go

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
In the heart of LA, there's a lost little girl
With a head full of curls and the weight of the world on her shoulders
But her story gets colder, hold up
Every man that she's ever encountered have proved to be cowards
Misused and abused her and bruised her with power
Now her doubt's getting louder
And all her tears are building up, building up, building up
And all her fears are killin' her, killin' her, killin' her
She don't believe in love no more, no more, no more
She don't believe in love
But I believe in her
I believe in her
Cause I believe in love
And love believes in us

[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
In the streets of NY
There's a guy who's just trying to get by
9 to 5, selling dope on the side
For his son turning one
Money grams every first of the month for his mom
Baby mom's always calling with problems
Plus his brother in Harlem
Just got killed, a drug deal that has gone wrong
With everything that's going on
All his tears are building up, building up, building up
And all his fears are killin' him, killin' him, killin' him
He don't believe in love no more, no more, no more
He don't believe in love
But I believe in him
Yes, I believe in him
And I believe in love
Cause love believes in us
[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, she a bad lil' chick focused on good livin'
I chased it bad, rap life trying to find good in it
I had to tell her every city got a hood in it
All the time fine girls got me thinking I would hit it
She assumin' me and him is just the same
But she should realize a real nigga and accept the change
Girl I got separate brains, and they in separate lanes
One is chasing your love, the other never think
I love the fact you filled with knowledge, a freshman in college
With the mindset, love life won't help you prosper
Trying to help you love life, keep you from impostors
Maybe you just wrap money, give you a couple options
Really feel you deserve it, and I don't think that often
I'm just lost in facts, the truth hits
I'm riding round town with my new chick
Old chick on my mental, man this shit is too sick damn

Be smoking that crazy shit, in my city talkin' crazy shit
But you ain't know I'm a crazy bitch
And tell your lawyer that I ain't paying shit
Maybe you should chill, really in your feels

So in conclusion
Sometimes we lose focus
Planning our whole demise
We’re getting the big picture and making it the wallet size
So to what's important in my life, I apologize
I hope to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back, or bounce back wards?
You wouldn’t know how to act or would you take action?
That's just a part of life and if your vision's impaired
You'll probably lose it all tonight

What’s going on Marvin, dearly departed?

Upon them all upon mighty days
But sweet alcoholic nights are feeling faraway
Son can only Skype with his pop, stop
He’s only feeling love from his mom
Got rocks in my stomach
I can feel my soul bleed, self-love
But I never want my son to be me, holla at me
So I pray until I feel it’s not working
I’m a showman on the surface
Either way, it’s perfect
You ever feel like the purpose ain't worth it?
Well I do, I’m the poster child for young fathers working
I swear to god I wanna be free
And he just wanna be me
And I just wanna be him
I’m jealous and discreetly
I’m one of your own
I’m trying to raise a child
Still trying to raise me right now

And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em

And leave a young mother to be a pappy
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women — do we hate our women?
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies

You've been on my mind, I've been tryna let it go
I've been tryna find somethin' as incredible
As you and I, but that's a never
No feeling can compare to you
You just gotta let me know

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Take me over...
Can I hit it again?
I'm under your control
Can I hit it again?

[Verse 2: Jhené Aiko]
You stay on the grind, I'm always available
Rollin' in my ride, so I gotta take it slow
You got me so high, up, up and away we go
Racin' to the sky, I'm feelin' unfadable
'Cause the vapors, could save us
And take us and make us believe
That we are free (That we are free)
We can be free (We can be free)
So can I please…
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Take me over
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
And again and again
Take me over
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Been on this road so long, don't even know where we goin'
Let's roll some joints, it doesn't matter how many we smoke
So many cars need help decidin' which one I'ma drive
So many diamonds on my wrist, make my watch look alive
I ain't just talkin' all this shit, I'm really workin'
No days off, goin' hard, never takin' a break
And it pays off, more in charge, rollin' up on the job
Havin' fun with my life, you niggas hella borin'
So many flights it's like I'm teleportin', don't need a home
Bring the gin, bring the strong, bring the weed, bring the bong
Don't come alone, bring all your friends, I'll bring the smoke
How it feel when it's goin' in? Let me know
[Chorus: Jhené Aiko & Wiz Khalifa]
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again? (Yeah)
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again?
Can I hit it again? (Jhené, Wiz Khalifa)
Take me over
Can I hit it again? Can I hit it again? (Yeah)

[Outro: Jhené Aiko]
Take me over, I'm under your control7Embed"
