Ain't this what they've been waitin' for?
You ready? Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this
So I had to grind like that to shine like this
And the matter of time I spent on some locked-up shit
In the back of the paddy wagon, cuffs locked on wrists
Seen my dreams unfold, nightmares come true
It was time to marry the game and I said, ""Yeah, I do""
If you want it you gotta see it with a clear-eyed view
Got a shorty, she tryna bless me like I said achoo
Like a nigga sneezed, nigga please, 'fore them triggers squeeze
I'm gettin' cream, never let them hoes get in between
Of what we started, lil' nigga but I'm lion-hearted
They love me when I was stuck and they hated when I departed
I go and get it regardless, draw it like I'm an artist
No crawlin', went straight to walkin', with foreigns in my garages
All foreign bitches ménagin', fuckin', suckin' and swallowin'
Anything for a dollar, they tell me get 'em, I got 'em
I did it without an album
I did shit with Mariah
Lil' nigga, I'm on fire
Icy as a hockey rink, Philly nigga, I'm flyer
When I bought the Rolls Royce they thought it was leased
Then I bought that new Ferrari, hater, rest in peace
Hater, rest in peace, rest in peace to the parking lot
Phantom so big, can't even fit in the parking spot
You ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, then what you talkin' 'bout?
Gangstas move in silence, nigga, and I don't talk a lot
I don't say a word, I don't say a word
Was on my grind and now I got what I deserve, fuck nigga!
Maybach Music
[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait a minute (Minute), y'all thought I was finished? (Whoa)
When I bought that Aston Martin, y'all thought it was rented? (Yeah)
Flexin' on these niggas, I'm like Popeye on his spinach
Double M, yeah that's my team, Rozay the captain, I'm lieutenant
I’m the type to count a million cash then grind like I’m broke
That Lambo' my new bitch, she don't ride like my Ghost
I'm ridin' around my city with my hand strapped on my toast
'Cause these niggas want me dead and I gotta make it back home
'Cause my mama need that bill money, my son need some milk
These niggas tryna take my life, they fuck around, get killed
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
'Cause these Philly niggas I brought with me don't fuck around, no joke, no
All I know is murder, when it come to me
I got young niggas that's rollin', I got niggas throwin' B's
I done did the DOA's, I done did the KOD's
Every time I'm in that bitch, I get to throwin' 30 G's
But now I'm hangin' out that drop head, I'm ridin' down on Collins (Skrrt)
They let my nigga Ern back home, that young nigga be wildin' (Let's go)
We young niggas, we mobbin' (Mobbin'), like Batman and we're robbin' (Whoa)
This two-door Maybach with my seat all reclinin'
I'm like, ""Real nigga, what up? Real nigga, what up?""
If you ain't about that murder game, then pussy nigga, shut up!
If you diss me in your raps I'll get yo' pussy-ass stuck up
When you touchdown in my hood, no that tour life ain't good
Catch me down in MIA at that Heat game on wood
With that Puma life on my feet like that little engine I could
Boy, I slide down on your block (Block), bike on 12 o'clock (Rah)
And they be throwin' deuces on the same nigga they watch (Meek Milly)
And I'm the king of my city 'cause I'm still callin' them shots
And these lames talkin' that bullshit the same niggas that flopped
I'm the same nigga from Berks Street with them nappy braids, that lock
The same nigga that came up and I had to wait for my spot
And these niggas hatin' on me, hoes waitin' on me
Still on that hood shit, my Rolls-Royce on E
They gon' remember me, I say remember me
So much money, have yo' friends turn in yo' enemies
And when there’s beef, I turn my enemies to memories
With them bricks they go for 40, ain't no 10 a key
Hold up, broke nigga turned rich (Rich), love the game like Mitch
And if I leave, you think them pretty hoes gon' still suck my dick?
It was somethin' 'bout that Rollie when it first touched my wrist
Had me feelin' like that dope boy when he first touched that brick
I'm gone
Woo!261Embed"

Old ways, new women, gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
Funny how now my accountant is havin' trouble tryna count it
To the people that think that I owe you shit
Payback's a bitch and you know that shit
Y'all niggas gettin' too old for this
Please don't think nobody notices
I've been up for way too many days
Y'all sleep enough for me anyway
Y'all don't be doin' shit anyway
Y'all are not true to this anyway
OVO, East End, Reps Up, we might just get hit with the R.I.C.O
Everyone home for the summer, so let's not do nothing illegal
I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people
They gon' go Tony Montana and cop them some Shaq at the free throws
But they're from the way fam, there's not much to say fam
They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam
My dad is from Memphis, and I am the king
I should probably just move into Graceland
Madonna’s a ting I know and I’m the king of pop
I’m building Never-Never Land
How he hate me when I never met the man, woo!

Meek Milly!
'Cause we in the field with them birds like we play for the Eagles
I'm on probation so let me not talk what's illegal (Switch it up)
Today I woke up with my dream girl, she rich as a Beatle
For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter
Like Jordan, we back on that bullshit
We came up from nothing
We started on list's most wanted but now it's the Forbes list
We really was doing shit
I can hear echoes from feds on this beat from informants
I think they recording
Shhh, listen, you hear that?

[Intro]
I just wanna know how niggas going to jail
Telling on niggas, coming back home and it still being cool
I just wanna know how a nigga on Instagram and Twitter with fifty thousand followers
Ain’t got no money in real life, but still popping, I just wanna know
I wanna know, if a nigga ain’t really putting it in, but acting like he putting it in
Niggas still letting it fly like it’s cool, I really wanna know man
This shit getting different out here it’s getting spooky

[Verse 1: Meek Mill + Quentin Miller]
Now when that shit went down with Chris, you wrote a check
In New Orleans wore my chain to get respect (you a fraud)
So what that tell me? You a pussy and a fed
Say the wrong shit you know the shooters at your neck
I just wanna know, if you ain’t write that running through the six shit (huh)
Tell us who the fuck was Quentin running through the six with?
""Running through the six with my woes
Counting money, you know how it goes
All the real live forever, baby
And the fake get exposed""
Niggas writing for you 'cause you know you never did shit
When I threw that hook out, I was tryin' to catch a big fish
We the type of niggas to tie your mother up (Woah)
Fuck your sister in the ass and hit your brother up, pussy
You really sweet, I call you buttercup
You fucking dork you changed the style because you studied us
Coming with the same flow
Switching up your lingo
We just want a refund, this ain’t what we paid for
Every time that we come, we get what we came for
Spitting another niggas shit, but you claim you king though?
[Hook]
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
How these niggas acting like they trill but really fake
And people acting like it go
I just wanna know, I just wanna know
Was it Quentin Miller? Was it Hush or was it Detail where you really got your flow?
(Milli Vanilli that nigga)

[Verse 2]
Money make a fake ass nigga look real again (For real)
Money make a sucker that told look trill again (For real)
Says a lot about all the people that's feeling him
But I'ma show you bitch ass niggas what's real again
Heard that other nigga talking we ain’t get back yet
Let’s keep it short, nigga you ain’t get your chick back yet
And now she rocking with the chaser and now you missed that check
You went from Clear Port to boarding pass you miss that jet, hold up

[Interlude 1: Sample]
""Cat, I got to take them off of here—that's right—I got to take them off of here, there’s only one, and that’s me, you understand?
'Fore all that fighting, you understand? Sucka thinks he good—sucka thinks he can whoop me, And I know he can’t whoop me and I—Hey, boy, the nigga whole style is chump, you understand? When it comes to me, you understand, let me get mines first. Then after I get mine, y’all can do what you wanna do.""

[Verse 3]
You know you fucked up right? (Hey!)
You shoulda just said nothing
Now you're going to have to give me a check to stop
All I hear is platinum that platinum this
Meanwhile I’m on the carpet with a platinum chick
I got a platinum rollie, platinum whip
Niggas frauds I told the truth, don’t ask me shit
All this industry fake enemy and rap shit
It’s never really my style we got cash to get (Gettin' money)
I really started from nothing now it’s back to shit
Puffy almost caught a domestic when he smacked that bitch
Hold up, let that bitch breathe (Woah)
[Interlude 2: Diddy]
""Yeah, this is called poppin' shit. There’s no cut on it. There’s no cut on it. If your feelings get hurt, you feel like, ""Oh, that’s an arrogant little comment—"" no, this is the truth and the truth hurts. Haven’t I paid my dues? Haven't I weathered the storm? Didn’t I weather the storm? Niggas is gone and I'm here.""

You know what free is, nigga?

What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Stay up, I know these times ain't true

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Since a lad, I was cunning, just got a pad out in London
I keep stackin' my money, I'll need a ladder by summer
AK shots, niggas duckin' stray shots
Been a top dog, that's before the K-Dots
Crackin' in '06, immaculate showmanship
Talkin' like you Mitch, disastrous on the strip
Holdin' on your bitch, coulda never sold you a brick
With them people, you never been on a list
Mona Lisa to me ain't nothin' but a bitch
Hangin' pictures like niggas swingin' from his dick
We so different, you thought these didn't exist (M-M)
The Megalodon never seen on his wrist
I'm from the South where they never make it this rich
God is the greatest, but Satan been on his shit
Walkin' the pavement, I pray I'm illuminated
Over a decade and never nobody's favorite
Pot and kilo go hand in hand like we Gamble and Huff
My amigo, a million grams and we countin' 'em up (M-M)
You was dead broke, I let you hold a pack
You paid for it, but I fucked around and stole the track
Screaming ""gang gang,"" now you wanna rat
Racketeering charges caught him on a tap
Lookin' for a bond, lawyers wanna tax
Purple hair got them faggots on your back

Locked me in a cell for all them nights and I won't snap, uh

Locked down in my cell, shackled from ankle to feet
Judge bangin' that gavel, turned me to slave from a king
Another day in the bing, I gotta hang from a string
Just for poppin' a wheelie, my people march through the city
From a cell to a chopper, view from the top of the city
You can tell how we rockin', soon as I pop up we litty
Poppin' like Bad Boy in '94, Big Poppa and Diddy
And niggas counted me out like my accountant ain't busy
That's five milli' in twenties, sit up and count 'til I'm dizzy
Phantom 500 thousand, hundred round in a stizzy
Is we beefin' or rappin'? I might just pop up with Drizzy like
[Chorus: Meek Mill & JAY-Z]
What's free?
Free is when nobody else could tell us what to be
Free is when the TV ain't controllin' what we see
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Through all the fame, you know I stayed true
Pray my niggas stay free
Made a few mistakes but this ain't where I wanna be
Before I'm judged by 12, put a 12 on my V
Told my niggas, ""I need you""
Stay up, I know these times ain't true (Run it down)
Real life, what's free?

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
In the land of the free, where the blacks enslaved
Three-fifths of a man, I believe's the phrase
I'm 50% of D'USSÉ and it's debt free (Yeah)
100% of Ace of Spades, worth half a B (Uh)
Roc Nation, half of that, that's my piece
Hunnid percent of TIDAL to bust it up with my Gs, uh
'Cause most of my niggas won't ever work together
You run a check up but they never give you leverage
No red hat, don't Michael and Prince me and 'Ye
They separate you when you got Michael and Prince's DNA, uh
I ain't one of these house niggas you bought
My house like a resort, my house bigger than yours
My spou- (Come on, man)
My route better, of course
We started without food in our mouth
They gave us pork and pig intestines
Shit you discarded that we ingested, we made the project a wave
You came back, reinvested and gentrified it
Took niggas' sense of pride, now how that's free?
And them people stole the soul and hit niggas with 360s, huh
I ain't got a billion streams, got a billion dollars
Inflating numbers like we 'posed to be happy about this
We was praisin' Billboard, but we were young
Now I look at Billboard like, ""Is you dumb?""
To this day, Grandma 'fraid what I might say
They gon' have to kill me, Grandmama, I'm not they slave
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, check out the bizarre (Ah)
Rappin' style used by me, the H-O-V
Look at my hair free, carefree, niggas ain't near free
Enjoy your chains, what's your employer name with the hairpiece?
I survived the hood, can't no Shaytan rob me
My accountant's so good, I'm practically livin' tax free
Factory, that's me
Sold drugs, got away scot-free
That's a CC, E-copy
Guilt free, still me
And expect me to not feel a way to this day
You would say y'all killed me
Sucker free, no shuckin' me, I don't jive turkey
Say ""Happy Thanksgiving,"" shit sound like a murder to me
Smoke free, all of y'all callin' out toll free
Label rob you for millions yet you wanna put a hole in me
Sugar free, seasoned but I'm salt free
You lay a hand on Hov, my shooter shoot for free
I promise World War Three
Send a order through a hands free
Kill you in 24 hours or shorter, you can't ignore the hand speed
On god, it's off the head, this improv but it's no comedy
Sign I fail? Hell nah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
I spit crack for my niggas that be moving bricks
With they exclusive bitch
Sippin' on Amaretto when she loose and shit
Niggas sleeping on me then I Freddy Krueger shit
With a few Philly niggas that be shootin' shit
I'm like Dre, I wish I had my nigga Snupe for this
Oh, I grew up, I screw up a oz of crack
Then I blew up they knew us before all this rap
I maneuvered with shooters
You fuck around with me, get smoked like a hookah
My ruger go booyah, I do it for the streets
You do it for the nigga with the backpack
I do it for the niggas on the corner
Tryna make a meal ticket with a crack pack
Hold up wait a minute let me back track
Hov gave you 24, let you have that
Man you claiming you the king of New York
What the fuck wrong with you nigga, step back
Hundred shots, aim straight at your snap cap
Everybody want the crown so I snatch that
Heard your gun go doo-doo-dooo-dooo
Well my gun go blat-blat-blat-blat-blat
What the fuck I gotta whisper to niggas
To earn my respect just to get to these niggas
Go Ether, Takeover or Jigga on niggas
Or really go 2Pac and Biggie on niggas
What the fuck wrong with him
Like really I'm sick of you niggas
You've been in the game like a year and some change
And you feeling yourself so I'm killing these niggas like...

Let the beat come back and the streets come back

Make me grow these nappy braids, make the beast come back like

And a nigga fuck around get the R.I.C.O Act

And my lil' nigga Bobby can't eat those flats

Yeah it's Meek Milly, I'm bombing on rappers

Pair with a nigga like me one time, like me one time

You said, ""What I look like?"" Like my bitch, yeah
Look into your eyes, shit is dangerous
The pussy wet, I call it angel dust
I done put so many diamond chains on you, they get tangled up
I never felt like this, it's strange as fuck (that's what it's like loving you)
Got yo ex nigga calling, but he can't do much
'Cause you with the kid now, Ella Mai, boo'd up

Relation goal when we come through just like Beyoncé, Hova
This that Hermes money, this ain't no Fashion Nova
You said yo ex had you depressed and I'm just glad that's over
'Cause now you rockin' with a real one

Woo!
I'm on my way to an island and I'm poppin' shit at the pilot (Fly shit only)
Niggas be broke and be starvin' but still talkin' shit like they violent (Niggas is broke!)
They said that they honest, talk money, these niggas gon' say that they got it (Huh?)
Gettin' out with the key to success and these niggas gon' blame it on Khaled
They don't wanna see you win (They don't!)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (No!)
You don't wanna see your bitch caught up in the stars like she outer space
Mansion at the condo, condo at the mansion, and I'm runnin' out of space
Tell your homie, keep on comin' out his mouth, I'm sendin' somethin' 'round his way (Brrt)
Niggas barely getting lawyer money (Woo)
Better get some Sig Sauer money
Running 'round like you Superman, don't be selfish, get your mom insurance money (Ha!)
Woo, 'cause I'm the one to put it on your money
I'm the one that make it happen it to you niggas, would you fuck around and do it for me?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, hopped in the Wraith and I bought it, it's litty again
Fly out a bitch from the tropics, get litty again
All of my parties is poppin', you know that we litty again
All of the foreigns on Collins, you know that we litty again
They don't wanna see the squad (We lit)
They don't wanna see the Wraith (We lit)
They don't wanna see your bitch up in the stars like she goin' outer space
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we litty again (We lit)
Litty again, litty again, I got it, we did it, we litty again
[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Feature money out the safe, went and brought a Wraith, brought it down Collins
Niggas talkin' like they want it, when we in the city, they don't want problems
Niggas said they gon' rob us
But nigga, we comin' from welfare
I shoot a mullet when I pull it, how you catch a bullet like a NFL player?
Should've known it was litty when bitches start lyin' on my dick
Lie on that pussy like I hit
Can't even be a side, side bitch
I'm hittin' 9s, 10s, and you ain't even looking like you a 5
Broke bitches tryna do it for Twitter, when they used to do it for Vine, woah!
I'm the man of the hour, I'm the nigga with the airtime
Rolls Royce Wraith, put your bitch up in the stars like she in the airline
Niggas talkin' 'bout my hair line, I laugh about it, I be feelin' them
See, we both be making M's: they be makin' memes, I be makin' millions
I just counted up a Quentin Miller
A ""QM"", that's a quarter milli
They don't wanna see Jae drop ""6,"" fly private when he go to Philly
Funny money, yeah I know it's silly, but your ho feel me
When I pull up and I got a pour a whole four on it
I promise she gon' know it's litty, motherfucker, yeah

Stack the paper, fill the sofa up (Woo)
Lay on that paper, I am not slackin', I stay on that paper
I feel like it's a restraining order on that money, 'cause y'all stay away from that paper
I know some niggas that used to be ballin', but know they all feeling a way 'bout this paper

They thought I was makin' this paper!
Fuckin' it good, I be rapin' this paper
Shit, I might as well get married to money
I marry Nicki, still married to money
She rich as Mariah, I carry the money

All this ice is like fifty bricks
Rap niggas throwing hissy fits
I give my bitch a stack just for a Christmas gift
And my bitch so bad, she on my Christmas list
'Member I prayed, really I wished for this
To get the crib with the maid and with the picket fence
I'm with some niggas that mad, we taking risks for this
I'm talking risky business, flick the wrist
Lord knows that I repent for this
But Lord knows if I get penned for this
I prolly won't get home until I'm fifty-six
They say I'm the Messiah, you rappers is liars
I sign up at church just to rap at the choir
To spit my new verse at your wake while you're lying
The middle of the church have you wake, no I'm lying
I just came from jail, ain't do no crying
They put me through hell, sharpened my iron
I did my push-ups and I roared with the lions
Like hold up, from balling I'm tired
I'm back in this bitch and I'm back on my shit
Man they tell me be humble, I'm cocky as hell
Shout out my bitches that answered my calls
When I called you collect cause it got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
It made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up and slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew I would prevail
Came in the game, Philly as shit
Look at these rappers, they silly as shit
I do not know why they be gassing these suckers
But fuck 'em cause I am not feeling their shit
Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talking about work that I really put in
Talking about pistols I put on my hip
And I'm talking about foreigns I really could whip
That I really done drove
Really was froze in my hood and these bitches I really did hit
Really was chose, came up from nothing
And now they like, ""How he made millions so quick?""
I'm in the back and it feel like a sofa
I done seen bitches I'm fuckin' on Oprah
In my new mansion I feel like I'm Sosa
A brick on the table ain't sniffing no coca, no way

All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas can't see me with binoculars on
Back of the Maybach, shottas on
And all my niggas keep choppers on
Don't reach round me, that's a chopper zone
Every time you be on count, what the topic on?
Two hundred and fifty thou' what I dropped it on
See y'all think it's a game 'til FOX be on
CNN, momma picking out boxes for 'em
I want everything, got my own boxers on
Own headphones to get my popping on
I got my own Pumas that I designed 'em for 'em
Stick and moving on these niggas, get my boxing on
All I ever hear from niggas is what they prolly doing
But they be really talkin' 'bout what I be doing
All black Rottweiler, that Givenchy on
Drop top Rolls Royce but the top is on
And the windows down like see y'all later
Mirror tint on that bitch so you could see y'all hating
Champagne cork pop like we all made it
Ya'll looking from the sideline we all hate it
Money don't make it real
Don't give a fuck if its eighty mill', pussy
And just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley won't make you thorough, pussy
Still hating me from my city
I'm thinking is they for real, pussies
Cause all I got to say is kill
They'll come in like Navy Seals
That's word to my momma, I promise I ain't doing no block
And we shoot at you robbers and kill all you fuck niggas talking
Lately I've been on this money
Don't run it back up just to come and put you in a coffin
I heard you said you was running this city
I seen you in traffic and you was just walking
Niggas be popping that shit like they with it
When niggas start hitting all you did was talk it, you pussy
[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
All I wanted was a new Mercedes
Bending off the corner, whipping out the lot, I got it
Women love me but the niggas hate it
But how can I lose when I came from the bottom?
Lord knows
Nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows, nigga Lord knows

Started off poor with plans to own more
Now we own stores and fuck the baddest whores
I was on tour with niggas that sold raw
Started sellin' white, we won't sell it no more
I'm like, Trump ain't feelin' us, cops still killin' us
Niggas takin' shots, can't stop me, they ain't real enough
Cut her off, act like she's dead and it's killin' her
New Dawn, Hermes seat, I let the ceiling up
Just to kill 'em softly, ooh, get 'em off me
Try to crucify me like I'm Jesus the way she cross me
I'm too bossy and too thorough
To move like a weirdo, on point like an arrow
We started off with zero, now I'm seein' M's
Diamonds like water and they jumpin' out the gym
Shootin' like Harden if your head was the rim
'Cause niggas wanna line me like a shape up and a trim, damn
Back when I was broke, they was cool with it
Now every move I make I'm in the news with it
Even if I ain't do it they be like ""You did it!""
My teacher always used to tell me ""You gon' lose nigga!""
That's why I never went to school nigga
And why I'm rappin' like I got somethin' to prove nigga
Went and bought the mansion with the pool in it
Billy with the stamp, I get two with it
Move with it 'cause these niggas wanna take my life
No weapon formed against me every time I pray at night
Scoopin' thotties in the Phantom, that's the way of life
And make 'em fuck their best friends like they was dykes
Reachin' for the Glock every time I play the light
I'm on 12 o'clock every time I play them bikes
I'm with the pack, uh, gettin' back, yeah
Spendin' dope, nigga, sellin' smack, gang
I'm gettin' chips off music like Rap Snacks
Yeah, 10 mil in cash of Ethika, that's a fact
Money, power, respect, eatin' breakfast on a jet
I know these niggas upset, they ain't see me fall yet
Wins and losses!
[Chorus]
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 2]
Bloggers in a frenzy, truck to the Bentley
Ain't doin' no interviews, I'm busy, nigga we litty
So when you see me out don't ask me about no Nicki
Fuck I look like tellin' my business on Wendy
Niggas gossip like queens, we was servin' fiends
.40 bust your windows out: Jazmine Sullivan
They told 'em pop Mollys, I told 'em to be kings
Sippin' 1942 like it's lean
I done seen all these niggas try to downplay my dreams
So I'ma give it to 'em every time I'm on the scene
Pull up Ghost Ghost, Wraith Wraith when you see me
Some suckers wanna be me and some suckers wanna leave me
I know it, I go through it, don't show it
I told niggas who wrote it, ain't takin' back what I quoted
Started off with a quarter, flipped that to a half
Turned that to an ounce, got some shit in the stash
Nigga say that he gon' rob me, put a brick on his ass
Now every killer in my city tryna look for his ass
And one thing 'bout Meek Milly, I'ma get to a bag
Had to starve all day just to get to it fast
Like Ramadan, totin' K's like it's Palestine
Real niggas in my ambiance, bottom line
Ever since I met Ross and signed the dotted line
I gave my momma 10,000 at least a thousand times
Do the math on it!
[Chorus]
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war
The young niggas goin' all out for us

[Verse 3]
Talkin', this my cocky flow
Damn Daniel, why you son him? Mr Miyagi though
This that rose gold Patek, call me like '94
Mean nothin' to me, I tell you how it gotta go
Rain, sleet, on that corner when the block was slow
Everybody was tryna trap, we started poppin' though
Heard that bitch say she cut me, I was like ""¡adiós!""
In the field, knock 'em down, it look like dominoes
Young nigga, I turned my Impala to a Wraith
When you get a dollar they gon' hate
Bought my mom the crib with that gate
Private school for all them babies, now they straight, nigga

[Chorus]
They wanna see me fall
And I will never sell my soul
I'm on some shit that they ain't seen before
Dream chasin', catchin' all my goals
I don't need these whores
I'm gettin' money, me and all my woes
Play with me, you know it's all-out war

All my niggas mobbin' so we heavy in this bitch
Thirty grand for the Muller, that's a Chevy on my wrist
Woo! Cocaine Mulsanne
Young nigga blowin' up; Kurt Cobain—boom!
Skatin' on them like I'm Lil Wayne
And this 458 don't do the lil' lane—vroom!
Swerve on 'em, niggas gotta nerve on 'em
'Cause I heard the feds got him and he had them birds on him
But a nigga back home and now niggas roll with him
Caught a case, what you think? Nigga fuckin' told on him
I ain't get my shit snatched yet
You ain't get your bitch back yet
One call, niggas aim that TEC
Blood drawn, headshot, nigga brains on step
Hot shit if you pop shit

Damn, Tommy, you ain't got no job!

In a Range with your honey, I pull up, like, ""Ahh!""
I make them power moves with Jay and them
Them boys shootin', don't play with them
Maybach, Rozay and them
Rollin' down Collins, call Rugs, hit the A with them
Compound niggas live now
If it's the finals I'm ballin' like I'm LeBron now
I call up Onyx and tell them bitches to calm down
I treat the jet like a taxi the way I'm flyin' round
And I don't fuck with no niggas
If they don't fuck with my niggas
And I ain't fuckin' no bitches, if they fuckin' my niggas

You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
And they say bad girls ain't no good
Good girls ain't no fun
I still can't find a nigga that touch that
I don't know one
And I ain't searching for it
Never trust but I'm working on it
Fell in love with that ride game
Swimming pool, you surfing on it
Like 'Yonce, do the surfboard, surfboard
They still think you a church girl
We linking up on your days off
And I still give you that work girl
Like work, twerk
Do it like that video
Wanted that for a long time
Cool with it, I get it though
First year we both fronted
We had feelings we didn't show
Second year we couldn't hide it
Funny part they didn't know
How could something that's so wrong feel so right?
But who to tell you this wrong, though? This your life
Word up
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show
Nobody has made me feel this way before
I'm a good girl, but I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad-ad-ad
I wanna be bad for you
I wanna be bad

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
We just fucking up the city, going hard every night
Niggas hating on us, you know lord they ain't right
Cause I broke a lot of hearts, ain't do them girls right
But you broke hearts too, but that boy ain't fight
So they don't deserve it, it feel like it's perfect
I'm loving your style the way you preserve it
Just look at my eyes and see what's inside
You know that it's pride, you say that I'm worth it
But said I ain't ready, really I'm ready
Really I'm ready, I'm ready like never before
I'mma just give you a key to my heart
You'll be the first that I let in the door
I used to hear that you flirt with them guys
They never would score
All you was hearing about me and the women
Ain't trust them before
You know what you're doing, fuck what they said
You know what we on
When we in bed, it's like we on stage
And I got the mic so let me perform, sing it
[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
You bring out feelings in me I never show

Ayo, this the one? We all get caught in our own sins. Sometimes I have to remind myself, that on my worst day, I live like somebody on their greatest—and so do you. Don't let your demons take you to Hell. Introduce 'em to Heaven!

[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look, I got homies in the ground, skeleton and bones
And niggas doin' life, they ain't never comin' home
They said I wouldn't make it or never see the throne
And my baby mama hate me ‘cause she said I did her wrong
‘Cause I left, to chase my dream, get it any means
I said that I'll be back, she wasn't listenin' to me
That back-and-forth arguin' was gettin' in between
I said fuck them other niggas, I go get it with my team
If we all grind, we all shine, fuck a part-time
I used to play the block early mornin' and dark time
Now it's G5 flights, fuck a depart time
It was hard times, nigga, now it's our time
Just take a look at my life, rappin' brought me back to life
‘Cause I was in them streets, my heart was cold as a pack of ice
Every night we strappin' like we was in Iraq to fight
‘Cause niggas gettin' murdered for a block that do a stack a night
Whoa, I got to make it home to my son
On them papers with a firm hold on his gun
Before I snitch they gotta burn a hole in my tongue
Give me a hundred years in a hole on the sun
In boilin' water, in the world of no order
In the hood, ain't no loyalty, ain't no world for your daughter
Ain't no life for your brother, on the life of my mother
I'ma get the fam right, nigga, you damn right!
[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell
Nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, nobody wanna kill
The things we do just to make it through
But nobody wanna lose, nobody wanna fail
Nobody wanna die, we're just tryna live our life

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, I used to pop a lot of shit, now I keep it moderate
These niggas know I been iced out, hoppin' outta shit
Right now I'm prayin' for my son to get this scholarship
A nice university, one of these black colleges
Far as the hood go, I acknowledge it
But whoever ain't a snake's usually a follower
Luckily, I can tell the difference
My man comin' home, my other man gettin' sentenced
Soft niggas usually send the hate through the bitches
Jealous Instagram niggas hatin' on your pictures
We dream-chasin', y'all niggas walkin' behind wishes
Without workin' for it, not often you find riches
Some niggas find coffins, others just find ditches
Just ask around 'bout the militia, they malicious
D-block, finish that and cop more dope
I'm two-stroke, you four-stroke
If you got enough cigars we can all smoke
Ain't nothin' all good when you all broke
So we could never be equal
Never bite the hand that'll feed you
Never fear a man if he bleed too
Some niggas need a headshot, some niggas need two
Play sweet in these streets and they'll leave you
You can't see the Devil, he's see-through
[Chorus: Gourdan Banks]
Some niggas go to college, some niggas go to jail
Some make it into Heaven, some make it into Hell

This is my blues
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes, it's a fine old thing
When the night is cold and low
(This is a Dollar Bill beat)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Was it the money that made me a savage?
Poppin' them Percs and I made it a habit
Totin' them pistols and serving them addicts
That was exciting to me, I'm so excited to be
Started with nothin', we had to inspire to be
Niggas ain't flyer than me, I'm getting to it
Feel like the man, I got the plan
I call the shooters, they hop out the van
Play with the squad, get popped like a Xan
Pop like a Perc, I'm goin' ham
I'm goin' crazy on niggas, too wavy for niggas
Do magic like alakazam
I'm in the kitchen compressin' a birdie
Take out a nine and I sell it for thirty
Then straight to the jeweler, I'm bustin a Rollie
To light up the city like Meechie in '03
I got the plug, he send 'em OT
Don't know these niggas, these niggas know me
Even old niggas, they call me OG
Young nigga but I put it down
We was on it when it weren't 'round
All of sudden niggas wanna come around
Stay over there, my G
[Interlude: Meek Mill & Snowy White]
This is my blues
Do me one favor, take a few steps back
'Cause I'm back down on my own again
And look at yourself
Matter fact, take yourself outside your body
And then look at yourself
And see how you playing yourself, nigga
This is the blues I'm playing
Congratulations, it's the motherfuckin' Chasers
Yes, it's a fine old thing
You feel me? We on it
When the night is cold and low

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Gave you the plug
Try to be real with some niggas and put 'em on money
And show 'em some love
You did me a favor, I knew you was sheisty
I knew you would show who you was
It's only a matter of time before niggas get lined
And hit with them slugs
Get found in a pool of your blood, yeah, nigga
'Member they told me that we would fail
'Member they said we would see a cell
Down with that semi like Cam Newton
I'm in the field like the NFL
Niggas is sick' and I wish em well
I made a wish in a wishing well
I put a brick in a wishing well
Been through some shit and I'm sick of jail
No disease but I'm sick of cells
Sick and tired of sending niggas mail
Calling niggas just to get a bail
I just seen a nigga get a L

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Location: Toronto; Status: five star hotel, Four Seasons. Them chumps right upstairs, they know not to come down here playin' no real niggas. Mood: I'm still up countin' five hundred thousand cash. Nicki in the bedroom sleep, life is good

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've been in my cell for a week straight
Locked down 24, no more Philip's Steak
Damn, shit's so real it seems fake
Damn, let me take 'em to the green gate
When we was sellin' white girl
Audemar shinin' like it need a light bill
These niggas dick ride like they don't even like girls
A hundred thousand for the jet, yeah that's the flight bill
Damn, cost four bricks to go to the LIV nigga
Whole squad on some shit, that's how we live nigga
Twenty-five bad bitches what we did nigga
That's fifty different Louboutins bleedin' red nigga
Whew, I ain't blood and I ain't crippin' neither
On the phone with the plug talkin' Justin Bieber
I made a milly last week and I ain't touch it neither
Straight cash tryna give 'em straight gas
Catch you out in Brooklyn, get your chain tookin'
My Philly boys'll creep up on you when you ain't lookin'
With your lil memes, I be with the real queen
Screamin' free the real Preme, we be doin' real things
Pull up with a bad bitch, whippin' somethin' real mean
Marchin' all these fuckin' drums on me like a drill team
I be with my young niggas, all they know is kill things
Don't make me make a real scene, uh
See an OVO chain, probably take that shit
Said dreamin' wasn't enough, we had to chase that shit
You ain't write it' nigga, we caught ya, can't erase that shit
And you claimin' you HOV now? Why you state that shit?
Man I hate that shit, niggas be talkin' out they face
But soon as you body somethin' they be singin' like they Drake
Wait, niggas dancin' like they fruitcakes
Hotline Bling don't get no bing up in this new Wraith
Pull up on the plug, swap that bag with the suitcase
DC4 on the way, that's nigga's due date
Robbed you in your city and you told
Tory from the 6, you hatin' on him, Lord knows
Culture vulture, now it's time to pay the tolls
Soft as the lacrosse team, boy that's word to HOV
No reply, word to God I'm on the floor still
Me and Nicki watchin' the Sixers, I'm closin' more deals
Dreamchasers' double MG, we got the door sealed
Roc Nation, Atlantic Records, I'm on my fourth deal
When I met you, you was on my dick
Asked me to hold the DC chain, now you on some shit
Omelly told me get it back cause he's like ""boy's a bitch""
And I'm like, let him get it took cause we gon' charge 'em trips
[Interlude: Meek Mill & Omelly]
Fuckboy, huh charge you triple the way this real nigga stamp. Chasers, ahh. Location: Philly; Mood: Glock with 30; Status: triple OG, never been disrespected without retaliation, chump

[Verse 2: Omelly & Meek Mill]
I've been in the hood for like a year straight
Sippin' dirty, it be hard for me to stand straight
Damn, it's time to cut the dead weight
I'm tryna turn my CLS into a red Wraith
When I was sellin' hard crack you was scared straight
I dropped 9 and bought the Rollie with the red face
Meek the one that got the mil, the one that got the deal
I'm still lampin' with the shooters and they poppin' pills
These niggas like to rap diss they get popped for real
It's time to son these pussy rappers, I'm their pop for real
I'm the type to fuck your mom cause she's a thot for real
And I ain't got one, my pump playin' shotgun
Quarterback that Glock, Cam Newton, and you catch a hot one
And for the fam I'll keep shootin' until the cops come
Reload, double back, hold up cuz, I got one
Official only respect official and you are not one
No, we are not them, we be on some other shit
Deep in them trenches, duckin' narcotics and the government
Tracin' the dollar, flippin' that product, tryna double shit
Chewing like it's double mint
Man, who you niggas fuckin' with?
[Outro: Omelly]
Hah, hey Meek Mill man, I'ma start running down on these niggas too. Real rap, these niggas soft and they frauds, check DC record nigga, we flawless. Any nigga stepped up to the fuckin' plate got rolled over. I ain't just talkin' to be talkin', nigga, check the resume. How many times we got to fuck the city up for you niggas to pay homage. Fuck you niggas talking bout nigga? Slide through 20 deep, I'm talkin' bout 7 Rolls Royces, 3 Maybachs, 20 Rollies, 30 Cubans, 25 bad bitches, 25 Chanel bags, 6 Caddie trucks, jumbo jets.

You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Uh, niggas know the rules in my hood
If you touch me you get murked
We ain't with that back and forth, it ain't no rap, we hittin' first
G-5, we be at LIV by Sunday when you in the church
Momma stressin', sellin' dinner platers
Tryna get your casket and get ya hearse
Last nigga that slid on us got dropped on it, he told on us
Every nigga you see with me got ice on 'em, bank rolls on us
Naw nigga, no 1 on 1's, we don't fight fair, we just roll on 'em
V-S stones and Cuban links, all that ice wear with that gold on 'em
We ain't swingin' no flag, nigga
We ain't need no pass, nigga
Glock 40 with a 30 clip and a laser on it, play tag with us
Everybody wanna talk bricks
'Til them feds swoop in and grab niggas
Dream Chasers got into somethin'
We don't ever blink 'cause we trash niggas
I don't know if y'all heard 'bout what my homie do with that 30 out
Deen Buck still in the cut and the state fittin' to let Ernie out
I ain't even gotta say nothin'
'Bout that other homie that you heard about
'Cause if he heard about that you run your mouth
He come to your house and start swervin' out
Catch me N-Y-C, out Shadyville, I'm in the tank
Only time it's Manhattan when I'm in the booth or I'm in the bank
Summertime in La Marina with Dominicans goin' in the paint
Pullin' up, screamin', ""Eh, Dimelo'?""
Catch you in Brooklyn, get pita-rolled, pussy!

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Niggas say me and Sosa beefin'
But we both eatin', but only one keepin'
Told Law he take 15 years
Every crime we did we gon Keep It Secret
Can't tweet Teyana, corporate nigga lookin'
So what I’m on I gotta keep it secret
That face no Stevie no Mimi, I promise Teyana that I won't leak it
Gripped the 30, just cashed out
If you caught strippin' then you assed out
I'm the same nigga my city asked about
While you in the cut steady buyin' clout
Fuck the judge, let 9 out, hairpin trigger, let 9 out
Four birds in the trap like four wings at Harold’s
With fries covered in mild sauce
Everytime a nigga rap beef, get clapped up in a couple weeks
IG comments and a couple tweets
Location on, we can go and meet
Headshot, I'm outta town, I'm in Killadelphia with my nigga Meek
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C, I got the 30 on with my nigga Flee
Heard Tyga sneak dissin' on me, tell them thot bitches I'm not right
Tyga only got one name, but that nigga ain't got one stripe
He backpack, so easy to get the nigga shit snatched
Ask Mally Mall to get his shit back
In Chiraq, don't come here
You ain't from here? Don't come here
'Cause shorty snipin', bag on him if he don't like this
No Young Chop, that .40 bangs just like him
30 punch like Tyson
Back to the rap flow, hot shit
Fuck I gotta rap for, got bricks
Every city I go, got sticks
Pockets Wells Fargo, no bricks
Say I'm on top now, no shit
You can never say I wife shit
I don't even like shit, I just pipe shit, one night shit
L.A. with killas and thuggers
New York SlowBucks, them my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
We gon' shoot shit up in public
And they gotta urge to take

500 dead bodies, better go and get money 'fore you be on first 48

Hangin’ out the tank with Slow and them
Come take a trip to D.C.

Fuck ya bitch to my CD

Ooh, shine got me iced out
Stay low 'cause the mice out
You only get fly when the Mikes out
Can't wait 'til it get nice out
Tell Chino bring the bikes out
Got 50 guns in my trap house
You better off fuckin’ with the White House
I’m the realest youngin' in the fuckin’ world
I got plenty money, I got plenty girls
Got a villa for the week, got fifteen freaks
And they all wanna go for a fuckin’ swirl
Had her come to us with the marble pearls

Make him catch our shit like Fitzgerald

R.I.P. to my lil' nigga Snupe (Rest in peace to a real nigga)
Yeah
We the realest niggas in this shit
Reporting live out of Philly
Young nigga loved popping bad bitches and wheelies
And I'm talking all this money, now these niggas can't feel me
Money long, team strong so these niggas can't kill me, ah

[Verse 1]
I get a rush from this lifestyle
Solid gold presidential with the ice dial
When the chasers in the building turn the lights down
'Cause every single nigga with me gon' be iced out
Glock 40, living life wild
I go to court for probation and looking like trial
The DA told me she want a nigga but right now
I'm living better than ever, I'm thinkin' like, ""How?""
Is it the money? Is it the cars?
Is it the way a nigga living that took me this far?
But still they want me with the sins and give me them bars
They lock a nigga in the dark I still look like a star
I shine, I grind harder, I'm working my mind smarter
I take care of my grandmama, mama, my ma's daughter
They telling me I ain't shit, I made it for my father
I just hope you pray for me, matter fact sing for me
[Chorus]
Lil' Snupe, they killed my lil' nigga Snupe
My lil' nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' niggas shoot?
'Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof

[Verse 2]
And as I'm rolling through my city, nigga, all I see is murder
Ain't nobody seen it but shit everybody heard it
And ain't nobody hiring so everybody serving
And all this gunfire and shit everybody murkin', better get a strap
Young niggas selling 'caine just to get it back
And they busting out them things 'til they sitting back
And if a nigga hit my homie, we gon' hit him back
And if you send him over here, know we gon' send him back
My flow iller, I came up from dope dealing
I been sayin' I'd make it, they telling me no
Nigga these voices all in my head just telling me go get it
I came up on four wheelers, bananas and gorillas
Through the jungle where killers rumble and everyone perishing
Realest nigga in it no comparison
And they got the nerve to tell me that I'm arrogant
But what the fuck, I'm young black, I made it in America
So I'ma ball harder than the mahfucking Carters
Beyoncé and Shawn, arm bluer than their daughter
Maneuver through the water like a shark that's on a dolphin
Nigga darker in a coffin, Devil on him, get 'em off, hah
I can look at your homies and tell you foul, dawg
Leaning with your left but you still a southpaw
Be the same niggas that'll take you out, dawg
Leaving niggas hungry but you eating Mr. Chow's, dawg?
Where the love at? Where the love at?
I'd give up all this money to get lil' cuz back
Just for my nigga, go starving, like, ""Where the grub at?""
Give up the fame, start over and get my buzz back
Do it again, murder his killer, him and his friend
Put the arena, step on the stage, kill him again
Look at the stands, the fans coming, filling them in
To give my nigga a chance, see him winning again
[Chorus]
Snupe! They killed my lil' nigga Snupe
My lil' nigga was the truth
And all he wanted was a coupe, all he wanted was a coupe
So what's a nigga 'sposed to do?
Tell 'em put the guns down or tell these lil' nigga shoot?
Cause they'll do the same to me, do the same shit to you
And all these niggas in my roof, that's why I got a bulletproof

I say, ""Do it for them bands""
Fucking with that broke nigga, you should do it for your man
Lately, I've been on the low with a ho that you probably know
Took her to the crib and met momma right at the door

I done took so many trophies to momma
My momma know her son a real nigga
I get that money, pay them bills, nigga
My momma told me, ""You a real nigga""
And I be hanging with them real killers

It really hurt me when they killed Shaddy
I was locked down in my cell and I had to read about it
And when they killed Diddy, left him out in Philly
We was young and gettin' money, man we used to run the city
We was rockin' all them shows, fuckin' all them hoes
And when they killed Darryl, Renee had to see him froze on the ground
Downtown, I can hear the sounds now
When she walked up to that casket seen her son and fell down
I drop tears for my niggas that ain't here
And still think about you even though that it been years
'Cause half the niggas that I grew up with is all dead
All this pain and all this stressin' I should have a bald head
'Cause when my Aunt Rhonda died she looked Tak in his eyes
Saw death comin', when she seen it she just cried
Prolly part of the reason we drink and we get high
When I find the nigga that killed my daddy know I'ma ride
Hope you hear me, I'ma kill you nigga
To let you know that I don't feel you nigga
Yeah, you ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
Cuz I was only a toddler, you left me traumatized
You made me man of the house and it was grindin' time
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga
[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 2]
And I ain't ready
Niggas wanna murder me I'm ridin' around heavy
I think they wanna wet me like New Orleans and the levees
But I got this Mac-Elev-y, these niggas'll never get me
Lord knows, I got alotta homies in the dirt
Niggas sprayin' metal tryna take you off the earth
Really over nothin', tell me what it's worth
Tryna take you out the game just to put you on a shirt
I rose from the jungle like Derrick
Death to anybody that oppose my spirit
My future looking brighter than this rose I'm staring at
We be runnin' trains on the hoes y'all cherish
Rest in peace to my niggas, I swear I miss them to death
My hammer sing murda music, I'll let you listen to death
I'll have you walk with the reaper when hollows rip through your chest
'Cause if you throw 'em I throw back like Mitchell & Ness
I'm gone
[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
So I'ma let this flame hit you just to let this pain hit you
And for all them cloudy days I'ma let this rain hit you nigga

[Verse 3]
Man my life so real
Last night I went to sleep and woke up with the chills
Started with a dollar now I got a couple mil
And I make a hundred thousand every time a nigga spill
Man I almost got murked in front of the same church
My dad got carried in, family got married in
That was in my older days, this is now, that was then
Had the block jumpin' for them dollars, Shawn Marion
Young nigga gon' get my own that's why I'm arrogant
Homie need the bail, for them bonds we'll bury 'em
Lock 'em like a terrier, breakin' all barriers
Just to beat the trial we go miles like Darius
'Cause cops tryna catch me, niggas tryna clap me
Haters runnin at me, know they wanna get at me
And people got the nerve to ask why I don't look happy
I did it for my niggas, and I did this shit for Kathy
[Chorus: Meek & Bill Withers]
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
You ripped my family apart and made my momma cry
So when I see you nigga it's gon' be a homicide

I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Started fuckin' bad bitches, I went runnin' wild (gone)
I just pray Papi forgive me, ain't seen my son a while (I pray)
I go and pick him up from school to see him fuckin' smile (facts)
Somebody save me, save me
Tryna please a bitch, it almost drove me crazy
I was breakin' bread with niggas that was shady
I said I would never change, but shit it changed me

Twenty-three and one, it almost drove me crazy
In a cell all alone, can't let it phase my
I just wanna make it home to see my baby

I fell in love with these streets, I seen a hundred thou
Bustin' choppers, sellin' dope, I went to runnin' wild
Threw a drum up in my forty, shoot a hundred times
Two hundred thou my cousin's case to see his daughter smile
Somebody save me, save me
All this lean and all these percs gon' drive me crazy
I see niggas switchin' sides like they KD
I can't let it kill my vibe 'cause I'm too wavy
This what I wanted, I'ma own it
Anything I ever said I'm standin' on it
Got my dog in the feds, he turned informant
I just pray that he don't say some shit to harm us

One time my dog tried to line me, must've lost his mind
When he know how we get down when niggas cross the line
And I hate to be the one that gotta call his mom
That money mix up with that greed, it happen all the time
If I can't trust you, it's fuck you
Know that money ain't a thang, I tell 'em touch you
Know them boys gon' bust your brain, I push a button
To make it home to see me son, know I'm gon' crush you
'Cause that's important, to keep it one hundred

Move my family out the ghetto all I wanted
Left me dancin' with the devil, chasin' this money

And I'm so tired of makin' moves and gotta keep the tool
Gotta hide it from my son, I pick him up from school
With them papers with it, some would tell me I'm a fool
But all these hatin' niggas wanna see me on the news
And they debating on a nigga if I'm gon' win or lose
'Bout this paper I seen real niggas forget the rules
And I can't trust these bitches, I know they gon' pick and choose

Yah
Big bag, got 'em big mad
A nigga gettin' to some money and his bitch bad
Jumpin' out the Rolls truck with the temp tag
I'm gettin' money, I don't get mad, ugh
Ask a nigga in my hood, he gon' say that I'm stamped
And when them situations came, I came out like a champ
When it was pourin' down rain and I came out of it damp
But now it's champagne showers when we poppin' the champ', ugh
We dodged all the Feds and they traps
Niggas can't be us 'cause they rats
Stand tall, point a finger, never that
I knew a nigga had it all, went to the bing, ain't get it back
That's why I'm humble as ever, and I rumble whatever
Don't chase hoes 'cause they come with this cheddar
I seen my man girl start actin' bougie when he fuck up his cheddar
Before you knew it, niggas was fuckin' her better
I knew about it and I-
Wanted to tell him, I felt funny as ever
But when I told him, he went runnin' to tell her, damn
Remember I was down bad, I'm talkin' under the cellar
Now the Rolls Royces come with umbrellas
For the rain and all the pain that we been through
If you don't feed your wolves they gon' put you on the menu
That's why I be with family and some buls that I been knew
If money determined loyalty, we'd cut you with a Ginsu
Now I go against you, facts
[Chorus]
Rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
Rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses
Rule number three, save you some of that money, shit you better stop splurgin'
'Cause when it's all said and done and you back at the bottom, they gon' treat you like you worthless
Respect the game

[Verse 2]
Fuck the fame
We millionaires fuck your watch and lil' chain
Niggas disappear as quick as Lil Zane
You feelin' yourself, I know you got a lil' lane
Just hold your composure, I seen this shit happen over and over
That couple hundred thousand holdin' you over
That ain't real money
That's bill money, buy a Rollie, get a wheel money
Catch a case, pay a lawyer, take a deal money
Now you tapped out and got no appeal money
Callin' home like niggas done did you wrong
But when you had that money you could've put niggas on
And the moment they put cuffs on you, your bitch was gone
Student of the game, I'm just ahead of my class
I'm that nigga, but I never got my head up my ass
You doin' good, but I'm ready for bad
And you won't never catch me frontin' 'cause I'm used to bein' second to last
Respect the game

Rule number one, never count your homie pockets thinkin' you deserve it
Rule number two, never trust a bitch that'll fuck you for some purses

In the casket he ain't even have no blood in him
Prolly the reason why I keep taking these drugs quicker
Ain't got no patience for these motherfuckin' fuck niggas
I watch everybody change, they thought I lost it
But now they all bustin' U-ies its gon' cost 'em
I seen Chino shut the casket on the coffin (Truce)
Killed his only big brother and we lost him
So I'ma hold it down 'til we all win
We've been at the Clearport ballin'
I just want to see my niggas flossin'
Hundred bands everytime I walk in
If you keep it trill you'll get a blessing for it
Deep down in the trenches with that Wesson on me
My mama, she can't sleep, I come here early mornings (mama)
But mama I got thirty in this dirty .40
Any weapon formed against me shall not prosper
Used to pray them Ramen noodles turned to lobster
Gotta watch my own homies on the roster
Cause this the type of money'll get your lined up

And I can't trust nobody
They hit your homie and they knocked the soul out him

Relax your mind and kick your feet way up
Selling dog food tryna feed my pups
Young rich nigga and I'm built Ford Tough
And I'm going through stuff
I don't feel no love
I shake your body and you still wake up
Taking Perkys, man I fill my cup
The feds watching and they still might come, I'm gone
I wan' see my brother with the Patek, not the static
Gucci wrap your toe up, got retarded with my daddy
All they seen was red bottoms bleeding by the casket
Perkys got me focused, I done noticed all the damages
I don't see no purpose, in the county eating sandwiches
Lost so many niggas, I went crazy, I couldn't balance it
You can't question God, yeah, yeah, and then there's challenges
Sipping on this Actavis, I swear, I gotta manage it
SRT the challengers
Make that work do acrobatic flip, accurate
And I'm leaning like a project banister

But I ran through them hoes, and I ain't talk 'bout Reggie Bush
I say y'all fuck niggas so fold, hoes ain't never gon' look
In the kitchen with that pyrex and a 9 piece, let me cook
Now hold up, I went and bought a Phantom cause I wanted to
And now I drive the same whips as Stunna do
Real nigga, 100 proof
I'ma need a 100 M's to make me comfortable

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Verse 2]
All I know is just flex, shittin' on my ex
Bad hoes on my team, dick 'em down like Next
I rock YSL so fresh, fly as hell no jet
Waves on 360, make that pussy get so wet
She say I'm cocky, I say that's not me
She call me papi and I say ven aqui
Wrist wear on hockey, Porsche box like Ali
My sneaks they bally, in my hood I'm prolly just rollin 'round in that ghost
Watching out for them folks
Heater on my hip, trunk full of that work
I say my shooters like Dirk, 10 racks and you murk
I put that on yo head nigga, first week and you dead nigga
I bottle pop, I model pop
Pull up on them bikes, let the throttle pop
Niggas know I'm nice, and I got a lot
Like fuck yo corner, I buy the block
[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these bitches

[Verse 3]
I don't chase no bitches, I just chase my dreams
We ridin' 'round so dirty in this whip that's so clean
My old head, she 30 but that dick suck so mean
And that pussy just so good for that pipe, she my fiend
On that pint I just lean, perk got me bent
If you ain't talking 'bout money, you ain't got no sense
Smell it on my clothes, work got that scent
In that kitchen with them birds, 'bout to serve up that's din' - Hold up!
OZ's and whole keys, straight white and no trees
Great white and OZ's and they might just OD
I stay tight with OG's, they know I'm real nigga
Pocket full of them racks and my bank account, Meek Mill nigga

[Chorus]
Stuntin' all on my old hoes, styling all on my haters
Presidential is rose gold, say it's time to get paper
Big crib with no neighbors, ball hard but no Lakers
Spent a 100 racks on my chain, all them hoes know my name
I be flexin', flexin', flexin' on these niggas

Yeah, la-da-da, la-da-da-da, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I never had a role model
I was loading gold hollows in my little Glock-40
A little shorty, heart colder than December in the morning
And I think it was December when they swarmed me
Niggas is jealous, fuck can they tell us
With them dreams they try to sell us? Probably why I'm rebellious
To a fraud nigga, I lost niggas when I got paper
It's like more money I made, they got faker
And it's crazy when your best friend turn into your top hater
Wanna roll out on you and smoke you like top paper
Damn, what a feeling when you and your homie chilling
And you know he got thoughts of probably robbing and killing you
Momma said don't ever, ever let them belittle you
And stay away from them haters cause they'll riddle you
Last year was like a bad year
Even though I touched more paper than a cashier
Small circle, I ain't never really 'round squares
They say there's levels to this shit, you niggas downstairs
Different floors for different bulls
Different tours on different jets, my niggas saw
Different city with different bitches and different whores
Sometimes I look in the mirror, Meek Milly, this your car?
Look at your arm, check out your neck, look at your charm
And to think my niggas started off with cooking raw
When it was hard the coach told me to get the ball
I step back for the three, watch it go swish and fall
And that was and-one, they thinking how we get this far?
We was just down by three and they thought we took a loss
They couldn't D me like Earl Boykins, I'm sticking soft
Tried to pick me off like Champ Bailey but I'm Randy Moss
And I ran it all for the touchdown, what now?
Gold AP all bust down, fuck clowns
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I wouldn't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold
Told them I would make it one day, only Lord knows

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Dedicated, determinated and disciplined
When Diddy, Hova, and Baby talking, I'm listening
When I be in the jungle, the Devil be whispering
Slugs flying by me I hear them, they whistling
That was a close call
Stand up nigga so I won't fall
My teacher told me I would never go far
Seen him last week, he was my chauffeur, I was like ""told y'all""
Mommy was a booster, daddy was a shooter
So they couldn't blame me when I went and copped a Ruger
Looking at my homies, see the ghost of Freddy Krueger
Cause if he catch you sleeping he's gon' knock out your medulla
Oblongata, I'm a father and my son don't see a lot of
If I don't get he gon' probably end up with a chopper
In a field out in Philly do you feel me?
Told my momma I won't let these haters kill me
Getting high even though it might derail me
And I won't ever let these bitches see the real me, do you feel me?
Times change like the Rollie did
Now I'm killing these niggas the way that Kobe did
[Interlude: Diddy]
Ayo, it gets fucked up when your own family start calling you up
Shit, money's the root of all evil
Family start telling you ""you acting different nigga""
You're goddamn right I'm acting different
With all this motherfucking money
But then when it comes from your brother, your sister
Your mother, your father, that shit hurts you to the core man
When they start acting like something that you ain't never motherfucking seen
You done grew up motherfucker
They gave birth to you, know what I'm saying?
You got raised, you done played in the park with them
This money thing, this shit will fuck you up man
You got to watch what you ask for
You sure you want this son? You sure you want this money?
You sure you want this fame? You sure you want this power?
Shit have your own mama talking to you like you ain't shit
Yeah everybody want it, everybody need it, money motherfuckers
Get money don't stop but I ain't mad at them
Shit, but shit even bosses got feelings you know?
Dear mama, dear papa, family, we're all we got
Don't let this money bring us down
Shit, everybody eats B, everybody eats, everybody eats
Let's go, hahahah

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Uh, yeah
And we started off as kids, stomach's touching our ribs
And them streets all night like we ain't have nowhere to live
I remember Sundays we ain't have nothing but Liv
Thirty thousand was the tab and you ain't have nothing to give
I ain't trip, I ain't trip, I pour bottles, I ain't sip
I let niggas shine bright, you still act like I ain't shit?
Let you have them little hoes, they was all on my dick
And your main wanted to fuck me nigga, I ain't hit
Twenty chains, eight watches, can't fit on my wrist
When I speak about them things I never said it's my shit
I said it's ours nigga and when you're ready we're gonna ball nigga
Like Kobe Bryant, Metta Peace and Gasol, nigga
But I know just what I saw nigga
It was envious, you looked sideways and I remembered it
The reason that my heart's cold now on some December shit
You used to give thanks for giving on some November shit
Talking about the twenty-fifth, matter of fact the twenty-sixth
Maybe it's the twenty-eighth, fuck it though my money's straight
As long as Papi smiling
I'mma be on airplane mode flier than a pilot
I've seen it, I've seen it
Jealousy in your eyes, I swear that look was deceiving
And I was surprised man I ain't want to believe it
You said you would ride but shit, I know you ain't mean it
But yeah nigga I've seen it
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
My heart getting cold, and the streets getting colder
They said I would't make it no way
I think my heart getting colder, my heart getting cold

You have to eat the dream
You have to sleep the dream
You have to dream the dream
You gotta touch
You have to see it when nobody else sees it
You have to feel it when it's not tangible
You have to believe it when you cannot see it
You gotta be possessed with the dream
Yeah, any weapon formed against us shall not prosper
Young nigga started with Oodles of noodles, now we eating lobster

[Verse: Meek Mill]
As I walk through the valley with my ladder in flex
I'm the realest nigga in it, I just happen to rap
When they all thought we was finished, they was laughing at that
So I went and bought me a Dawn and flipped that hat to the back
Fuck 'em
New jewelry, new whips on the way now
Brr, brr, that's yo bitch on the way now
Mama told me if you fall, never stay down
Stand up nigga, I can never lay down
Wins and the losses, it come with being bosses
Shoot a pussy nigga in his head if he cross us
Take that shit to trial if the feds making offers
Five hundred thou', lawyer said we lookin' awesome
Swap that Patek for them cuffs, take them off us
Lil' bitch, call me Lil' Fish
Niggas tryna turn my lights out, it's still lit
Streets calling and they said they want some real shit
Young bull looking like he hit a real lick
I got too many foreigns, man this shit getting borin'
Half a milli' last week, you would've thought I was touring
Niggas tried to count me out, I guess they thought I was normal
They ain't know I was different, I'm like ""Lord be my witness""
'Cause we was fucking up them dishes in my grandmama kitchen
Get a pigeon, do division, break it down on my niggas
Fuck they opinions why would I listen, they ain't see the vision
When I had a foreign them bitches know I ain't see them bitches
So I'ma ball on 'em
Magic City, let it fall on 'em
And all my niggas stayed down with me
Know I be there if they call on me
Yeah!
My nigga bail half a milli, he made it home in a week
Even my momma know how I'm rocking, I go on them streets
Glock .40, keep it on me, we rolling 32 deep
Bulletproof everything, just let me know if it's beef
We bring the war, I just wanna shine like my Rollie
Put in all this time that they owe me
Made it to a nine and we litty
Dropping 60s too like we Kobe, oh
Pushing the foreigns, drive through the trenches (Trenches)
Top of the food chain, head of commission ('Mission)
We wackin' niggas without permission ('Mission)
Never was personal, it was business (Brrrrr!)
Settle down, let it settle down
Couldn't tell me shit when I was broke
Fuck they gon' tell me now?
I'm running round
Glock with a drum that hold a hundred rounds (Brrr!)
If it was ""Fuck them niggas"" then
It's fuck them niggas now, fuck 'em!

All that ass, Lord have mercy
All that champagne, these bitches thirsty
Verserchy, no hold up, I meant Versace
I prolly pull up Roberto over Cavalli
Puffin' on Cali, prolly out in the valley
Sippin' on something drowsy, bitches twerkin' like Miley
Twerk, twerk for a real nigga sellin' work
Promise I won't tell a word
I been on that trill shit, way back
North Philly nigga, but I'm laid back
Get shot in your head drivin' your Maybach
Homey D Clown know I don't play that
Sippin' dirty, riding dirty, I say hi to thirty
Call your dog,  I call my dawg and he'll buy a birdy
Try to school me, I'm getting out here early
Dope dealer, Puma life, back of this soccer jersey
Mink draggin', tell PETA I'm swaggin
All these karats like I'm tryna lure in a rabbit (Dag!)
Just to put it (Put it where?) On my jacket (On my jacket)
(What they askin?) What you doin? (What you doin?) Doin' fashion

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Okay, I walk with a limp and I talk with a slur
I might wear every single chain and mix it up with my fur
I might get every single drink and mix it up til I blur
I tell the bitch get on my lap, but don't you get on my nerves
I need that bag full of green like a lawnmower
John Doe and all Sean Doe it, and I keep it G
Yeah, I ground floor it, and I'm pound blowin'
If her pussy good then I might one, two, three, round four it
Got her down for it
Yeah, nigga overthink, never under stress
Yeah, I understand, your girl over, I'm so unimpressed
Yeah, and she tryna fuck me raw, unprotect
But if I don't have that rubber on it I feel under dressed
Yeah, and I got money bags under my eyes, ho, cause I ain't sleep
They all Goyard too cause I ain't cheap
Finally Famous Aura Gold is my I-N-C
And I put everything in motion like I-N-G
And when we flyin' private you could bring the gun on with us
I got this freak to 3rd base, she tryna run home with us
And I got comma on comma on comma on comma... on comma
And I ain't talking about no run on sentence
Yeah, nigga hot headed so I need that Chings Chili
Put my P up on her head like that bitch is reppin' Philly
And I wheelie in that pussy like my nigga Meek Milly
On my way to meet millis
Lawyer drafting up the deep deep dealies
I got rich decided that ain't rich enough
When I did it big, bitch, I decided that ain't big enough
Dead Pres, who you diggin up?
Who that nigga that you hating on, but just  can't get enough?
Fuck, the jig is up, little bitch
[Verse 3: A$AP Ferg]
I'm like Madoff but I made off, scheming on niggas' payoff
I never take a day off, your stash is short like Adolf, Hitler
You should lay off on the gangsta talk cause you're fake, dog
You never pushed no yay, dawg, ain't see no keys like Ray Charles
Me and Meek in the Maybach, we get Wale and take off
We got your bitch in a big house, she walk in hype like ""Hey, Ross, how you doing?""
Get with a dreamchaser, we ballin' hard like the Lakers

See, they say, in the sleep state
The brain thinks much more visually and intuitively
Ha, what is this? (Maybach Music)
I like this Maybach Music! Swate!
As dreamchasers, we accomplish that wide awake
Turn everything up a lil bit in the headphones!
You ready? (All-Star!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ready or not, here I come
You can't hide, nigga I'm too damn fly
Sippin' all of this purple, it got me too damn high
They say they're down for the team but playin' two damn sides
I'm like niggas ain't loyal (no!), niggas ain't loyal (no!)
And these voices in my head saying niggas ain't for you (nah!)
And when you gettin money these niggas will aim for you (fire!)
And when its looking sunny these niggas will rain on you
It's a dark cloud over me, money took control of me
I'm barely getting time to see my son and that shit hurting me
Baby momma trippin out, I tell her to work with me
I'm on probation still strapped, 'cause niggas want to murder me
And lately I've been getting faded (faded)
Cut a couple homies off cause them niggas hating (they hating)
And all these bitches wanna fuck me

Big dreams turn to big things (things)
I’ve been waiting on this day since I was 16 (16)
Big chains, Aston Martin as I switch lanes (skrrt!)
Before I ever made a hit, I had a wrist game
In the kitchen with them thangs, trying make a killing (killing)

'Til I put some money on their head, yeah, make 'em feel it

They label me a victim but now look what I become ('come)
Or should I say became, I don’t do it for the fame
I’m from where they never make it but I went against the grain
Charges riding against my name, assasination to my character
Life’s a bitch, she cheated on me but I married her
Niggas getting murdered, this shit is getting scarier
Dodging all the potholes, jumping all the barriers
And if she a bitch, I feel like I just got in that pussy (yeah)
Shorty wanna be a star, that’s why she popping that pussy
She trying to win, so she hang amongst winners
That’s why I take the time just to pray at mom’s dinner (I pray)
Cause I remember, cold nights not the winter (not the winter)
Not the weather, I’m talk about within us (within us)
Cause for that money, sins they get committed
And friends, they get to splittin', divided just like division
So every day that I wake up, my undivided attention
It goes to getting my cake up and staying out of them prisons
Yeah! The system made me stronger
And being broke just gave me my hunger, I'm gone!

'Member when I spent my re-up on a oowop, woah
Your favorite rapper a mumble rapper
Walk up in this bitch, a bunch of killers and humble trappers
I can't go to Hollywood, to cool in this jungle action
With niggas that'll smoke you, go and murder your brother after
Whoa, big dog, nigga, I'm a big dog
Streets said they need that dope, they having withdrawals
I put on my yellow diamonds when I'm pissed off
I'm so rich that I can't even fuck a bitch raw, whoa
Do you know the feeling? (Do you?)
Being irritated 'cause you gotta count a million
All this fucking money, I ain't got no time for chilling
We took risks to look like this, through all that killin' and drug dealin'
You my nigga, I fuck with you, we gon' thug it out
Say it's beef? We going to war, nigga, let's slug it out
Big Bad Wolf, we at your door, blow down your fucking house
I heard your daddy was a rat, so you a fucking mouse, nigga
Pouring champagne 'cause all my niggas dead

Take it to the jeweler, bust it down before I wear it (Yeah)
Whew, 'cause I'm a king just like Martin Luther (Martin Luther)

[Verse]
Uh, make it out the hood, they say you Hollywood
How dare you niggas tell me that I got it good
Gotta check and treat these niggas like I'm Robin Hood
When it was time to stand up for me, see, nobody stood
And I was lookin' at you niggas, all the ones I fed
Had me grindin' all them nights when you was going to bed
And if you think I owe you something, nigga gon' ahead
Treat you like I never knew you, put it on your head
And I got Papi on my line like, 'When you comin' home?'
My mama see it in my face, she know that somethin' wrong
Bodies droppin' in my city all summer long
Out on bail but I still gotta keep somethin' on
'Cause I can't let 'em take my life, you might get left you make that right
When he got left it wasn't right, but he was tryna live that life
I call up Coon to book that jet, we like three deep, we take that flight
Used to land in California to play that studio all night, we stayin' down
For the love of them millions, ain't layin' down
Left you in the hood, what you sayin' now?
And niggas wanted the smoke, you said, ""Stand down,"" uh
Cold heart, never get cold feet when the pressure come
It was beef, I had to tell niggas, ""You better come""
Sister said they gettin' over, it's like you lettin' them
Some shit I had to learn my lesson from, uh
Checkin' in, checkin' out, I just had to check you out
2012, it was 50 niggas when I'm steppin' out
Forgot the time you asked me for a check and I ain't lend it out
I ain't even know you was upset, that's what this shit about?
A green piece of paper can turn you to a hater
When you can't bring up one time you returned me for a favor
So I pray these niggas real close, talkin' closer than my neighbors
'Cause I know the signs when niggas switch sides, catch them vapors
[Chorus]
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Scream, ""Ride or die,"" I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550
Used to be my dawg, you was in my left titty
Scream, ""Ride or die,"" I thought you would ride with me
Found out you was jealous, you wouldn't even grind with me
And when I copped the 6 you wanted the 550

[Outro]
See, I look at it like this
What I'm supposed to spend a thousand nights in the studio rappin' my lights out?
Goin' city to city, can't take my son to school when I want to, can't see my mama, my family when I want to
They give a nigga my money, then act like he hangin' with me
I ain't never been sweet
Far as I can remember, every time I went to jail I had to stand up in that bitch by myself
I ain't never even think about a nigga callin' my baby mama to pick my son up to take him to the movies
Go play basketball while I'm doin' this time in the cell
Actin' like I owe you somethin'
See, it hurt my heart to see some of my closest friends turn their back on me about that attention needle
Or a green piece of paper with a slave master on the front of that shit
I used to hear niggas, niggas that I was feedin', I heard 'em whisperin', ""Meek Mill finished""
I was like, ""And damn, I was feedin' you, bro""
All I did was keep grindin'
Through the storm, nigga, I'm like Derrick Rose on a 50-point night on a daily basis, nigga
For the love of the millions, royalty over loyalty, never get it confused
I got real friends and family that'll never turn their back on me for the love of the money
I got a homie that's doin' life—he can't offer me no money, he can't offer me nothin' but a friendship and a relationship
I talk to him seven days a week
So don't come to me talkin' 'bout no money shit, nigga
So if you feel some type of way about my money, we goin' to the furthest extent to protect that plate that goes in front of my son on the table, nigga
One love to all my family and friends that stayed down through all the madness
While I had to sacrifice and put it all on the line
One time for my mom and sister that never changed on me, even before I had money
Ride or die, no matter what
Dreamchasers for life, you dig?
Uh, I told niggas stop askin' me where niggas at
If you don't see 'em in the pictures with me, that mean they faded away
I got niggas I distanced myself from, we love each other, it's all love but everybody can't make it
Niggas wanna burn a bridge and expect you to send a yacht, huh? Where they do that at?5Embed"

Follow your dreams, not your addictions
How we gon' follow our dreams locked in a prison?
They tried to swallow me whole, God be my witness
Deprive me out of my dreams but I'm relentless
I want the money, ain't never want attention
So I don't pay attention to comments and all the mentions
'Cause they ain't see my vision
I was washin' dishes 'til my rags turned into riches
Glad when it was Christmas
We ain't even barely get presents, but we was gifted
In the school of failure, we present, perfect attendance
Welfare baby, we workin' with what they give us
Made me some commas, judge still gave me a sentence
No period, city girls don't get scared when it's really real
When your bank account twenty mil' and your house up on a hill
And your fam in the driveway, you walk out and see the grill
Thank God you believe, make sure you pray when you kneel, yeah

Ain't never panic, I'm a superhero (Uh)
Target my goals and I'ma shoot the arrow
When God turned the heat up on me, he said ""You De Niro""
Play your part, got some brains like the scarecrow
Let's play it smart, 'cause we ain't playin' checkers, this is chess, play your pawns
Sit back like a king, when they move, make your mark
And never ever let your competition take your heart (Take your heart)
Say I believe in myself
When everybody stop believin', never leave on yourself
They had my back against the wall, I had to lean on myself
Almost made me put my dreams on the shelf, I'm trippin' (I'm trippin')
Laws of attraction, you just think I'm rappin'
I'm just puttin' out the energy so I can grab it
Everything that's in my memory that I imagined
It's finally here, hundred million in a year

Paulie killed Tony right and Tony killed Ty so it was only right
Bring 'em back twenty years, they was homies, tight
Sixth grade, for the love of the paper ain't nothing nice
And Paulie just loving life
He got them birds and he serving niggas left and right
Never used to party in them clubs every night
Popping bottles, blowing paper
Balling hard, he know they hating
But they gon' respect it, cause he rocked Tony
And Tony had the hood on smash by his lonely
And Paulie getting money so them bitches all on him
And his young boys riding, they ready to fall for him
Cause word on the street that Paulie did that
Used Key gold digging ass to get back
Text him through her phone, found out where he live at
She woke up in the morning like, I never sent that
But she never told Paulie what she saw
She was running her mouth, fitting to start a war
Cause Tony's little brother sixteen and up the wall
Robbing everything moving and breaking every law (LOOORD)
And Paulie on a rise now
Niggas that played the middle picking sides now
Plus he heard Tony's brother trying to ride now
So he put a check up on his head, he gotta die now
[Verse 2]
Paulie's youngest on the corner
Tony's little brother he slipping, yea he's a goner
Fucking with that lean, he dipping one in the morning
Shots fired, niggas scatter without a warning
He strapped too, reach and fixing to get up on 'em
The gat jam, he bang back trying to avoid 'em
Them niggas dumping, he get up running and hitting on 'em
He hit the alley, get a body he dipping on 'em
Said it's on now, try and kill 'em it's war now
Swisher in his mouth while loading his four pound
Feeling like he dead there ain't no remorse now
Getting high and he thinking 'bout kicking in doors now
Momma and little kids get on the floor now
Finger on the trigger he feel that it's going down
Old ladies gotta hear that thunderstorm sound
Cause they sad when it rain it really gon' pour down
And it's raining like Katrina, he got thirty in his nina
Seen Paulie car dropped thirty in his Bimmer
Paulie wasn't in it when he heared it he was steaming
Addicted to the murder so you know that nigga fiendin'
And he want this nigga dead before Sunday hit
But youngin' tryna live on some Sunday shit
And time fly fast it was Monday quick
And paulie bout to get back on his gunplay shit
And show 'em how it's done so he loadin' up his gun
And show this young nigga he fuck with the wrong one
Got a short temper and clutchin' the long gun
And it's on sight he don't give a fuck if the law come
[Verse 3]
So he out here
Ridin' dirty put down them birdies
And without fear niggas lurking
They tryna murder heared he out there
Niggas spin 'em they tryna hit 'em
Hitting every corner seeing niggas but he ain't with 'em
Youngin' layin' low he know Paulie ain't playin' though
There's money on his head and niggas is sayin' go
But youngin' he ain't scared, he cool as a fan though
He know it's get down with that burner or end up a tag-toed
It was four in the morn', Paulie goin' home
Windshields wiping, middle of the rain storm
And Paulie he ain't slipping yeah he got that thang on
You know what he did to Tony he won't get the same song so
When he hit the crib he spin the block before he park it
Paulie ain't bitch at all Paulie just cautious
But little did he know niggas in the streets talking
And out his rear view it's like he seen a reaper walking
Nigga with a hoodie all you hear is heaters sparking
Shot hit the window get low he tryna off him
Youngin' boxed him in and Paulie can see the coffin
He get to reaching, trigger squeezing, trying get him off him
Them shots ringing youngin' squeezing clip empty
That's when Paulie rose like Derrick, put six in him
Walked down on him he laying in a puddle
Looked him in the face, ""you ain't learn from your brother nigga?""27Embed"

He let that go, I'm like, ""He buggin,'"" now she thuggin' with a real one
I've been ballin' on you 'cause you smart and loyal
All my homies know me best, they say I'm fallin' for you
And that box be slippery like tryna walk on oil
And I'll be there long as you there when I be callin' for you, facts

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign, Both]
Girl, as long as you, wrap your arms 'round me
Ooh baby, I don't care what them people say

Girl, you know I can provide
Whatever you need (Whatever you need, babe)
Listen to your heart, baby
[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, you can get whatever you want, whatever you need
Got a one-way flight 'cause I ain't lettin' you leave
We ain't fuck first night, had me beggin' you please
But you love when I'm beggin', you told me get on my knees
And I ate it, we got faded
You said, ""Put some Tory Lanez on"" and I played it
In Philly, we say you the main jawn and we save it
Finally got a rich nigga, baby, you made it
Long as you hold me down, you know that it's goin' down
Be there when I turn around and I'll turn your world around
I had to tone it down 'cause you made me slow it down
But I got you open now so I'm 'bout to show you now, show you now

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
What makes you think that I would try to run a game on you?
Just as sure as my name is Dolla
I'll be there for you and I'll
Treat you just like a queen and give you fine things
You'll never have to worry 'bout another in your place
So believe me when I say

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Ty Dolla $ign, Both]

One Night I prayed to God
I asked could he please remove the enemies from my life
And before you know it I started losing friends

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Y'all was like my brothers
I considered y'all as folks
And I remember nights sipping liquor making toasts
Talking about the life, trying to get it slinging dope
Niggas say I changed, but you niggas changed first
And fuck all this money nigga, we was fam first
Looking at me balling, know that Instagram hurt
Cuz you was supposed to be that nigga in that damn Ghost
I would have rolled for you even in the same hearse
Same cemetery, bury me in the same dirt
We had a plan, but I guess it ain't work
""B.H we straight,"" that was the motto my nigga
I got rich first, you was supposed to follow my nigga
I'm gone
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
And Dat Nigga Lil
Shit I can't believe you (not you)
That's what that syrup and that weed do?
And when I came home I tried to feed you
And every song I was screeming free you (Free Dat Nigga Lil)
And if you bled I was down to bleed too
Now when I ride by I breeze through
I don't even stop, ain't a need to
And you the one that left nigga, I ain't leave you
Shit got realer, niggas got richer
I said the money train coming, niggas missed it
I even tried to spin back around to come and get you
But niggas wanted more from me then my own sister

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
They want more than my mother
More than Omelly, and that nigga like my brother
Greedy motherfucker
Crazy thing about it, I don't hate em, I still love em
I might have said things, I never said fuck em
But I'm a live my life, get the money, ball hard
Still sending earned money for his calling cards
Rick ain't complaining, he got life behind bars
And he still calling me, bet you he ain't calling y'all
Cuz none of y'all niggas ain't send him shit yet
None of y'all niggas send him pics yet
I'm still writing money orders, sending big checks
And remember when it rains, niggas get wet
Gone
[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Somebody who you're around wants to clip your wings and shoot you down
But its okay to keep enemies close
As long as you know, just make sure you know who you're around

[Outro: Meek Mill]
I still love niggas
But its like we just grew apart
If you don't grind, you don't shine
Half my niggas still around, and we all shining hard

So, okay, you want to see some macho shit? I’m the most macho nigga out here. I'm the most.. I thought you niggas knew, I’m the most thuggish nigga out here. I have no mothafuckin’ fear… I have no fear, I have only ambition, and I want mine, and I will do anything to protect and feed my family

[Intro: Meek Mill]
Take money!
Yeah! Take money! Haha
Unh!

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
First off, fucked your bitch, nigga, get a blood test
You a upset, nigga, where the love at?
When we talking 'bout Philly, know I fucking run that
Same place I've been up corners you can never come back
You fraud nigga, ball like I'm Chrissy Paul, nigga
I cross niggas, when you hate it 'cause you lost, nigga
You soft nigga, then you disrespect a boss, nigga
You dissin' to get you on, that'll get you off nigga
Broad nigga, and you was screamin' ""come to my hotel""
Nigga, we was slingin work out the motel!
No scale, Barry Reese, I know you so well
I caught your chick, I pulled that bitch like she a coat tail
Let's keep it trilla, you ain't never make a dope sale
You ain't never played that corner--make a coke sale
On a late night, swimmin with the great whites
You was rockin' durags, big tees, fake Mikes
Boy you had a wild week, shoppin' on Canal Street
Same place you bought your fake chain and your time-piece
How we gon' believe you? Nigga I should lead you!
Talkin' ""PC,"" that was never Beanie Sigel!
That was never ME, why you lying to the people?
I was locked down, still doing shit illegal
Running around in jail like, ""I ain't give a hell,"" when
You was on PC, locking it with males
[Interlude: Meek Mill]
And I ain't got time for this shit, let me get another one

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
23 and 1 never get to see the sun
Had to get a glass visit just so you could see your son
Took a deal on your homie, 'cause you couldn't beat the gun
They was tryna give you life, man, you know that wasn't right
Then you left him in the hood, on his head, he had a price
You ain't even give a call, other niggas shot him twice
Niggas trynna get a buzz off my name for some likes
Dead rapper, I'm at you, I'mma give you one tonight
Ca-ssidy! Boy, you so trash to me
Do the math I dissed you, that's subtract to me
You ain't poppin, what the fuck could you add to me?
You just another dead body, another casualty
I'm in the streets, so I do this beat casually
And I ain't even write this shit, why you mad at me?
Cause you nursery rhyming, flow perfectly timing
And I'm giving gas, I'm in the Aston, one Swizzy's designing
Now beat it, I know you're heated but I know you need it
I got that Justin Bieber please believe it, nigga I know you see it
They play piano at your viewing, let Alicia key it
I asked Swizzy ""could she do it?"" he said ""nigga, beat it""
Swizz don't fuck with you, Melo didn't either
You fucked that check up, you bit the hand that feed you
And you was 6 feet, you got me digging deeper
Hold up, let's switch the beat, so I can spit some ""Ether!""
[Interlude: Meek Mill]
Oh shit! You purple-dickie wearing-, durag-, over-sized fitted-, fake Air 1-wearing nigga!
[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I say, come on with your soft ass, all you niggas all trash
Couldn't bet a 100 grand, nigga, that's a small tab
I'mma hit him where it hurs, this gon' make his dog mad
'Cause this verse gon' hit this nigga harder than that car crash
That you should've died in, I'm mad that you survived it
But I came to murder you and have you scuba diving
Swimming with the fishes, all you niggas is bitches
Dick riders, knocking on the wood, superstitious
Pause that, I'm all that, I'm really in the trenches
And when I see you, nigga, I'mma have you jumping fences
Cutting through the alleys, you must be on the molly
Sniffing all that white shit and fucking with that Bobby
Come to your hotel and meet you in the lobby
Just to Worldstar you and do you just like Tommy...
Hearns did Martin, I burn in the Martin
That Aston when I start it like a lion when it's roaring
Boy you lying, you ain't touring, you can't even get a show
Shit you like a pound of reggie, they can get you for the low
And I'm like a brick of Diesel, it cost 60 for the flow
You ain't a gangsta, you a wanksta, nigga, 50 even know, whoa!
[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
You say you a gangsta, but you never pop nothing
And you locked your homie out when you heard the cops coming
Rapping for a long time, nigga, you ain't got nothing
You ain't wanna battle Mook neither, nigga, stop fronting
Damn, homie, in high school, you was the man, homie
Fuck happened to you?
You had a doghouse with a doghouse in the backyard?
Now you living in a doghouse in the backyard?
Nigga, I was broke then, now I got Black Card
Your career maxed out, your shit like a MAC card
Easy, nigga, I talk greasy, nigga
And I'mma stunt on Instagram just to tease you, nigga
Couple months we at the funeral
I swear to God that shit was beautiful
Five-X tees, durag's, the usual
Your mama screaming like ""Cassidy what they do to you?"" OH!
[Outro: Meek Mill]

Being broke so I started selling coke (Coke, coke)
Times got hard, was selling soap
Scheming just like the preacher in church; he selling hope (Hope)
Now I'm getting older, heart getting colder
Looking at my son while his head lay on my shoulder
Thinking in my head, ""Will I make it to see him grow up?
Or will I catch a bullet from something these niggas throwing?""
Trying to take me out, in the hood trying to make it out (Out)
Niggas plotting on me cops all staking out
Trying to get a couple bricks so I can make a house
Close friends hating on me, really tryna play me out
Damn, but niggas couldn't deal with me
If they had blackjack, my shooters would still hit them

And dirty at, where everyday they murder at

By the age of 16, man, them hammers was out
So when niggas trying to hit me, I'm just handing them out
Cause I ain't trying to see my mom crying (Crying)
And my sis mourning (Mourning)
So I'ma let this little Mac 11 rip on them
Louboutin sneaks, watch the blood drip on them
For all the times I bled, the tears I shed
Every time I made money, it was here, I said
And if my niggas asked for it, it was ""Yeah,"" I said
Selling butter just to get the fam bread, I spread
I got married to the streets and it was here I wed

The man with the gold makes the rules
And one who makes the rules break the rules
Some niggas make it alive, some make the news
It's either family or money; I hate to choose
'Cause you need money just to feed the fam
The family keep you cool
Got a nigga on the papers; still, I keep the tool
Niggas heard I'm getting money so they creeping through
I keep my hand up on that hammer what's for me to do?
Let these niggas kill me? (Yeah)
Try to line me up so they can rail me?  (Yeah)
I'm just giving you the real me
Started with a dollar now I got it and I'm filthy

This is the life
This is the life
Yea,this is the life
This is the life

[Verse]
Tony killed his own man Ty for a whole brick
Lined him all up and gave him the whole clip
Said he wasn't eatin', he wanted his own shit
And not to mention Ty was fuckin' his old bitch
But Ty wasn't a shooter, that nigga just sold bricks
And Tony he was reckless he never had no picks
Tony was like the Alpo, Ty was the Lil' Rich
Two niggas with a dream that plotted on goin' rich
Started as a team, but Ty he got on quick
Jealousy the reason that Ty got left all stiff
Got Tony at the viewing, Ty mom crying to him
He hug her, he tell her whoever did this, he gone do 'em
From there it was a silence, she ain't condone violence
But they killed her only son so when he said it she just nodded
And he told her that he got her, Grimy at its best
Like Tony had a cold he feelin' slimy in his chest
Yes, he had the nerve to carry the casket
Strapped up before he went he had to carry his ratchet
He nervous, walkin' like he tryna carry him faster
Nigga even grabbed the shovel tried to bury him faster
Next week he at the mall, Rollie on his arm
Two bad bitches with him laughing having a ball
Seen Ty cousin Paul, Paul couldn't believe it
Same nigga asked him for a front last weekend
Walkin' round the mall, Louie on, bags Neiman
With the gold diggin bitches Little Ke and Bad Trina
He dapped Tony up, tryna cap Tony up
In his head thinkin' how he gone clap Tony up
But Tony he ain't worried, cause he strapped Tony up
Seven days of running he already turned it up
He got Pauly burnin up, he ready to ride
He know Tony a killer but he ready to die
Ahhhhh, smell the death all in the air
Pauly thinkin' bout puttin' a check all on his head, but he can't
Cause Tony he done killed his first cousin
If he let somebody else do it it won't mean nothin'
He wanna' see him bleedin', he wanna see him gaspin'
Wanna' watch him die slow, like he sufferin' from cancer
Feel that Tony did it but he don't really know the answer
So he gone let it burn until he get confirmed
Couple months fly by, Tony on the high rise
Started flippin now he got them chickens in like Popeye
Pauly still gettin' it, always been a top guy
He ain't really club but tonight, he gone stop by
Seen Little Ke and them, it was two or three of them
Standin' in the line he said ""I'mma pay for me and them""
Pulled his money out, started countin' it and teasin' 'em
You know Ke gold diggin' ass just wanna' be with him
Slid up in the club told the waiter ""Give me three of 'em""
Bottles of the spade, now Ke just wanna leave with him
He said ""Where yo phone at"", she said ""Where you goin' at?""
He said ""I'mma slide out,"" she said ""I'mma ride out""
Told her friends ""call ya'll tomorrow when I get to my mom house""
They got right up out of there, took her to his side house
Soon as they got in the crib, she just blew his mind out
Wasted off them bottles Pauly bought she on her nod out
But Pauly he ain't goin to sleep
Grab her phone up off the sheets
Took it to the living room, her messages he goin through
Scroll up to Tony name, he text her ""What you doin' boo""
She text him back ""I'm in the crib"" he text her back ""you comin' through?""
She text ""where I'm comin' to?"" he text back
""1022, Woodstock in North Philly, take the E-Way to the zoo""
She said that ""I'm comin' now"", look-e here what Pauly found
Got the drop on Tony where he living and its goin' down
Couple weeks later Pauly on Woodstock
Sittin' in the minivan, tinted with his hood cocked
Tony just rode up, Pauly got the good drop
.44 in his hand bout to make the hood rock
Tony slippin', Pauly all dippin'
Walkd' up on his car like ""What's poppin' lil' nigga""
Tony lookin' shocked, his Glock was in his box
So he couldn't grab for it, Paul said ""That's yo' ass boy""
He said ""you still need that work that you asked for?""
Dropped it all on his lap it was four and a half raw
Tony he lookin' crazy he know that's his last straw
And Pauly just let it go, put his brains on the dashboard

Hundred K large on my Audemar
When we run down we hit one of y'all
I'mma post up at the corner store
Trappin' all night but I shine like I'm Armor All
I am so hot I might break the thermometer
Coppers they watch us and follow us
Flip through that paper no calendar
All of these jewels like I celebrate Hanukkah

I'm on a different kind of grind
I'm with some different type of niggas
We on a different type of time

Get at me, and deep-throat a three-eighty gun
Pussy wet, Swiffer jet, come through on that bigger jet
We land in them new ports, no babe not cigarettes
Clear ports, air force, sweats on with a big diamond
Make niggas stare at my hand even though I am not mimin'
Different type of money, you on a different type of broke

Was the money good?
Was 'em bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 1]
See my momma cry too many tears
And we been broke like too many years
It ain't too many kids, a couple homies, there ain't too many there
And they all gotta eat, they got too many kids
Too many kids with no fathers, doing too many bids
Too many bids, judge gave them kids too many years
As soon as you get that money, that's as soon they appear
Assuming you 'em  owe something, they assuming you’ll share
And yeah, I've been losin' touch with my family, it ain't the same
I should've gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should've hit the crib with my son and played a game
But instead I ended up at the jeweller to make a chain
It's a sad saying when you make money it make you change
Like four quarters, the fourth quarter, I make a lane
Shit, I had to walk for it they talkin' 'bout takin' trains
And takin' planes, I put the work in and made the name
But the question is
[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 2]
I never wanted to be like Mike, I wanted to be like Mitch
Now all the lil' niggas wanna be like this
I wear my chain in any city, let you see my shit
Cause I earned that, it's on me, I'mma keep my shit
I got blood on my money, ether in my soul
Do you know the feeling durin' Easter with no clothes?
Now it's stars in the ceiling, bringing ether out the Rolls
With the curtains on the windows, I'm just peekin' at my goals
Money made me iller, already was realer
Young kings killin' young kings over skrilla
That's why I ride around Mac on me like I was Miller
Or Reggie when I shoot for that three
They drop fetty, that's good money
Come to my city, we talk heavy and die young
When we get some paper, we cop Prezis and ride rim
20 inch rims for the dope boy
Sellin' that coke boy, trappin' on your note boy
Got that buy it all money, fuck I need a note for!?
In them school hallways, ""fuck I need a note for!?""
We ain't wanna go to class, we was sellin' coke raw
The principal was coppin' too, hit him with a snowball
[Chorus]
Was the money good?
Was them bitches bad? Was they fuckin' good?
Did your hood show you love? Did the hoes say you fly?
If your friends say you're loyal, throw your Rollies in the sky
For the trillest, for the trillest
As the champagne pours and the campaign roars
And the lights shine bright every night they applaud for the trillest

[Verse 3]
Lookin' for the intro
I was at the dealer lookin' for another Benzo
Matching kicks with my Kenzo, young nigga
Heart of a lion, hungry as hippo
When I was on my last, nobody ain't tell me shit though
Flow slicker than Crisco, niggas talkin', I get low
Do my thing, they jump back, know how that shit go
And they say I'm arrogant
I'm still eatin' steak with the asparagus
When I get that money like I married it
1 milly, 2 milly, 3 milly, buried it
Since they say I'm underground, I run that bitch like Harriet
Rolls Royce pushin' real slow like a chariot
Pull up on them niggas that doubted me, shit embarrassin'
I'mma real nigga with money, never cherish it
You a fake niggas with money, it's no comparison
Told me that I couldn't get signed when I was rappin' it
And told me I couldn't do songs when I was battlin'
They told me that I couldn’t be trapper, I started trapping' it
Never listen to 'em, oh well, shit is immaculate
I'mma just go sit up in this Bach again
Smoke the weed and laugh at them
Make a couple million by accident
Couple niggas dropped on Twitter, they say they back again
Couple months later on Twitter they say us laxative
Shitted on 'em, Nicki voice, did it on 'em Benjamins
Plently of 'em Benjamins, semi on him and he on a
Whole 'nother level from before now
Tell my niggas when I see a hundred mil its going down
When I made my first mil, I was like ""it's on now""
Then I made my second mil, money on the floor now
Then I made my third mil, I'm like ""I need more now?""
I got in my zone and that money started pourin' down
Every time I hit the booth, microphone torn down
We couldn't get a pair of Pumas, we up in the store now, bitches!52Embed"

How I keep from goin' under?
It's like a jungle outside
Sometimes I wonder how I keep from goin' under

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We scream, ""Black Lives Matter,"" but we still toting ladders
Watching our own brothers trying to get at us
Dreams get shattered when a scene full of crackers
And they charge you with some shit you ain't do
You like, ""what happened?""
We go get lawyers to say shit, we don't know how to talk
They told us to hate each other before we learn how to walk
Mama taught you how to fight, fight, before she taught you how to write, right
And daddy locked down in the cell, can't kiss you night, night
Monsters under the bed every night, feel like it's fright night
Coke fumes in the air, mama holding on that pipe tight
And you catchin' contact, but never mind that
In a world where Black is wrong and white right, it's like a combat
We go to war for our freedom, they say we equal
I used to wanna play like Randall and be an Eagle
I used to play the quarterback, my dog would go receiver
That was 'til the ball got flat by a dope needle on the pavement
It's amazin', this environment we was raised in
On them papers, one mistake and I'm gettin' caged in
You gotta feel me, feel like the system tryna kill me
Got arrested and the charges F1 for popping wheelies, stay woke

It was designed for us to fail
We still prevail through the hell
Yeah, can you believe it? We're still undefeated
Though it was designed for us to lose
We'll still make it through, nothing's impossible
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Picture me ten years younger with some tats on my face
Takin' a bunch of Xannys with the strap on my waist
Pointin' it at the camera like mama ain't teach me manners
Tryna see mo' bills like I'm headed to Alabama, no, wait
I can't judge them, I'm just trying to understand them
'Cause I used to pop Percs, pourin' purple in my Fanta
Had me swerving in my Phantom like I'm runnin' from my dreams
I was headed for the slammer, I was plantin' all the seed
For them to bury me, I had my whole family mad at me
Fell deep in love with the game and it married me
Judge said, ""I'll give you a chance, just don't embarrass me""
Motivatin' these little niggas is like a charity
Community service even though they knew we was workin'
They did this to me on purpose, 'cause I ain't movin' too perfect
I stay away from them clowns, watch how I move through the circus
'Cause they be weighing you down, even some of them dudes in your circle, stay woke
[Chorus: Miguel]
Though it's designed for us to fail, yeah
We still prevail through the hell, yeah
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated
Though it was designed for us to lose
Nothing, nothing, nothing's impossible, no
Can you believe it? We're still undefeated

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
How can I pledge allegiance to the flag
When they killin' all our sons, all our dads?
I come from a place, when you kill your own brother you can brag
Like he got bodies, but that's a fad, no, that's a fact
I'm screamin' out at your corner, nigga, that's a trap
Screamin' out at your homie, nigga, that's a rat
Catch a case with him, bet he crack
The odds against you and they double stacked, stay woke
Bought my mom a new crib, that's some gangster shit
Niece and nephews walking around wearing minks and shit
Kept the hood motivated, this the thanks I get?
Try to Ja Rule the kid on some Wanksta shit
But that's impossible 'cause I'm unstoppable
The label can't drop me, nigga, I'm too valuable
You thought I would lose but I won and that bothered you
Still movin' 'round in Philly just like the mobsters do
When I talked to Em and Hov, they said, ""I'm proud of you
You stood tall back when everyone doubted you""
My reply is, ""I did what I gotta do
And I need that verse 'fore you retire too""
Jumping all the obstacles, I'm way too wavy
Said I would lose boy you way too crazy
Pick and choose either fame or the money, fame will make you crazy
And the money will make them bad bitches say, ""Thank you, baby""

I ain't never give a fuck
You think I'm supposed to give a fuck now cause I'm rich?
Shit on me made me worse
Hatin' ass niggas made me worse

[Bridge]
I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, it just make me
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me

[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll bitches straight up

[Verse 1]
And I done seen bitches change on me for a little paper
And I done seen niggas change on me for a little favor
It just make me, wanna stunt on ya'll niggas
It just make me, wanna fuck on ya'll bitches
And I be popping bottles in the club feelin' like Meecho
And you know my niggas gonna bring them choppers everywhere we go
And I don't ever tuck my chain I guess it's just a niggas ego
I'm just a young nigga ballin' wanna take me out the game D Rose
And that make me, wanna load up the choppers go crazy
And doors slide on every niggas that hatin' me
And stunt on every single bitch that ever played me back then
You don't wanna hear the Mac-10
No one hear the stories what you had then
Reason why I bought the Bentley and the Aston
To shit on niggas every time a nigga back in
[Hook]
And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me
And I ain't never care what a bitch had to say about me
It just make me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas

[Verse 2]
And it made me, wanna shit on ya'll niggas
Cause lately, I ain't been feelin' ya'll niggas
Try and play me, I drop a brick on ya'll niggas
And make 'em go crazy, on every single one of ya'll niggas straight up
And all these hoes wanna fuck with a nigga like me
But when I was locked down ain't none of these hoes write me
That's why I don't chase bitches cause the money only thing excite me
And I don't fuck with new niggas all day one niggas beside me
We got thirties, ridin' round tryna do a nigga dirty
Try and burn me, headshot bye bye for a birdie
And I ain't worried, about none of ya'll niggas tryna hurt me
I got all these killers on stand-by
And they kill any nigga tryna murk me word up

And I ain't never care what a nigga had to say about me

We don't never hate we ain't rattin' on nobody
When I touch twenty mill I'm a go and get that Gatti'
It just make me, wanna stack this paper
It just make me, wanna wack these haters straight up
And I be in the city going hard like a nigga own that
And you be fucking with the nigga that be fucking with the niggas code rats
I can't control my dogs with them 30's they don't never hold back
Ask about me in my city they tell you that we really on that
I got the baddest bitch

Yeah, uh

[Verse 1]
All the young'uns in my hood popping percs now
Gettin' high to get by, it's gettin' worse now
You gotta tell 'em put them guns and them percs down
Them new jails got ten yards in 'em and that's your first down, uh
And I ain't come here to preach
I just had to say somethin' 'cause I'm the one with the reach
Youngin' gotta quarter ounce, he tryna turn into Meech
Ain't had no daddy, he's had to learn from the streets
I used to be a honor roll student, damn
Then I turned to a beast
The first time I seen a nigga get some blood on his sneaks
He had on Air Max 93s but was slumped in the street
His mama cryin', that did somethin' to me, oh Lord
The shit I'm doin' for my hood I won't get an award
I used to sell Reggie, damn how' I get to the Forbes?
I take a shot, if I miss I'm gettin' them boards
Ain't quittin' no more, like give me some more
We wearing Old Navy, it felt like Christian Dior
Was dead broke but rich in soul, was we really that poor?
Was we really that dumb? 'Cause we carry a gun
And every nigga in my neighborhood carryin' one
'Cause we had nightmares of our mamas gotta bury her son
I'm speakin' to you as a prophet as rare as they come, uh
Gunshots sound like music hangin' out the Buick
Why you wanna be a shooter?
Mama told me not to do it but I did it
Now I'm locked up in a prison
Callin' mama like ""I shouldn't have did it""
Watch my dream shatter in an instant
I'm on a visit posin' for the picture
Like I'm going for my prom or somethin'
Like I ain't facing time or somethin'
Ridin' for these niggas like that shit ain't hurt my mom or somethin'
Only one gon' get me commissary or even buy me somethin'
When it all fall down
I can't call y'all now
Even if I hit your phone
That won't get me home
Seen so many different times, these niggas did me wrong
Shit that's the reason that I did this song
[Verse 2]
Shit we was kids used to play on the step
A couple years later we flirtin' with the angel of death
I was 11 years old, I got my hands on the TEC
When I first touched it that shit gave me a rush
My homie's dying I'm like ""Maybe we next""
That just made me a threat
Knowin' the niggas smoke my daddy it just made me upset
Made me a man shit I was five when God gave me my test
Go to court with a court appointed and he won't say he objects
Now it's you against the state and you ain't got no cake
Jail overpopulated they ain't got no space
I know a young'un that got murked ain't get to drive no Wraith
But he in the hearse on the way to church, I know his mom gon' faint
When she smell like embalment fluid, cologne all on her baby
Pastor said he sendin' you home, she goin' crazy
When they drop that casket all in the ground, who gon' save me?
How could you blame me? When I'm tryna stay alive and just survive and beat them odds when niggas die by twenty-five
When I stop fearin' for my life, when I decide to change my mind And stop totin'
Tryna smoke the pain away, they lock us up for smoking
Put 'em on probation, lock 'em up if you ain't perfect
Victim to the system like a rain drop in the ocean
They closin' all the schools and all the prisons gettin' open

[Outro]
Yeah
See comin' from where I come from
We had to beat the streets
Beat the system, beat racism, beat poverty
And now we made it through all that we at the championship7Embed"

Yeah, still on them papers, they won't let me off
Never thought we'd make it out the ghetto, now look where we are
Fucking famous bitches and that pussy taste like caviar
I done gave these niggas everything and that was from the heart
Rollie, chain, every car, all it did was left me scarred
Heard my dog talk behind my back and I'm like let him talk
I won't say his name but he gone feel this shit in every bar
Feel this shit in all my verses
Was it really worth it
Cut the grass and all the snakes gone surface
Nobody's perfect
Showed them cash, he kinda made me nervous
Maybe I'm trippin'
Hoping this paranoia from all this shit that we been in
Watched you pour gasoline, and burned out all of your bridges

I remember...

[Verse 1]
I remember nights I used to sell rock
Posted on the corner like a mailbox
First class ticket to a cell block
Just to get some Polo and some shell tops
Cold world and they say hell's hot
But it ain't hotter than that choppa when them shells drop
Man I seen niggas play that block and get they bell rocked
Cops cleared the scene and I was back by twelve o'clock
Tryna get it, Dickies on and my fitted
Gun in my draws, ducking the law, I'm all with it
Money, cars and clothes, I wanted 'em all nigga
I never was good at hoopin', I wanted to ball nigga
Cause the OG's sold keys and I had no cheese
Coppers lock me, beat me down like I was Cochise
Old fiends coppin' work through their old dreams
They got shattered, it ain't matter cause we thirst cream
Niggas serving niggas moms just to make a flip
Homies murder other homies just to make a brick
Most my niggas done got busted tryna take a hit
The feds were lurking, we was serving, they was taking flicks

[Chorus]
This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door
And if they chase you better hope you don't stumble
I wanted Polo with some shell tops
I just wanted Polo and some shell tops
And I was out there tryna sell rocks
Cause I wanted Polo and some shell tops
[Verse 2]
I done seen close neighbors lose hope
Fall victim to the streets and start to use dope
I used to load my gun before I went to school first
It's crazy niggas wanna kill me, we was cool first
And when it comes to friends you can't let 'em too close
That's why they call 'em close friends
You turn your back they move first
And I just bought a new Ghost
And a crib out on that new coast
And it all started from a dolla
Running from the law, scuffing up my Pradas
Crack all in my draws, tryna make a profit
All I wanted was some shells and some Polo for my closet, awhhh
Drug money, turn to blood money
I only roll with niggas that'll take a slug for me
No matter what it is, I'ma pay that bail money
To get my niggas right, my niggas for life!

[Chorus]
This how it goes down in the jungle
Where niggas learn to shoot before they could rumble
Cops rushing, they gon' kick in the front door

Same bitches fronting on me when I had my baby
It's crazy, and niggas say they made me
Taking credit from my mama, shit amaze me
How niggas talking down when I'm not around
But every time I'm in the building, shhh, not a sound
I line my haters up and clap them down
That choppa have nigga dancing like he Bobby Brown
I'm well-respected in my city, even out of town
And don't ever tuck my chain
Nigga, how that sound? How that look?
We don't live by the book, we just live by the code
A lot of niggas got exposed when feds came through
They was dropping names too
Niggas say I changed up but I'm with the same crew
I was always told to get the money and remain you
Never let these pussy niggas tell you what you can't do
Every time they said that I left, that was when I came through
Range new, .38 special when the flame blue
Just in case I gotta flame you
What a feeling when them people tryna frame you
Lock you in a cell when detain you
Rather die before I go out working like I'm Django
I'm gone...

She fuck me, she might get famous
She might get a chance to ride jet and drive Ranges
Money'll have your closest friends turning into strangers
That's dangerous, niggas shoot and they'll aim at us
Shooting in the sky, you tryna hit the angels up
Niggas tripping like y'all dipping off angel dust
And all these Cubans 'round my neck getting tangled up
I only fuck with bad bitches that be trained to fuck
Five niggas, ten bitches run a train on us
Looking at these rap niggas they all lame as fuck
Mini skirts, skinny jeans with the strangest cuts
I stick to the script, switch like stick on the shift
Early mornings in the kitchen like I'm whippin' the grits

Swear that Audemar flashlight like I'm flicking a pic

It's fucked up she gotta see me in jail
On the visit with Lil Papi, it hurt even though I seemed to be well
They got a smoker with a key to my cell, damn
And even worst, my judge black don't wanna see me do well
It's either that or black people for sale
Gave me two to four years like, ""Fuck your life, meet me in hell""
And let it burn like Lucifer, you look even stupider
Tryna impress them people in power when power abusin' us
For 44 dollars a hour, you coward they using ya
Is it self-hate that made you send me upstate?
This where the so-called ""real niggas"" sweeping up for cupcakes
And that's your phone time, if you ain't got no money, you ain't online
Hey call your son, call your daughter just to wish them more prime
Oh God, don't let them streets get a hold of 'em
Your daughter fuckin' now, it's gon be a cold summer
Your son trapping, and your homie giving O's to him
And if he fuck that paper up, he puttin' holes through him
And you just wanna make it home, so you can show it to him
And them people ain't finna give no parole to ya

And the judge got a hold on your father
Go to school, bullet holes in the locker

Ain't no PTSDs, them drugs keep it at ease
They shot that boy 20 times when they could've told him just freeze
Could've put him in a cop car, but they let him just bleed
The ambulance, they coming baby, just breathe
That's what the old lady said when she screamed
This nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th
And in the 13th amendment, it don't say that we kings
They say that we legally slaves if we go to the bing
They told Kaep' stand up if you wanna play for a team
And all his teammates ain't saying a thing (Stay woke)
If you don't stand for nothing, you gon' fall for something
And in the 60's, if you kneeled, you'd prolly be killed
But they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal
Kill your account, look where money get spilled
Check it, and they don't kill you now, they just take you out of your deal

How many times you send me to jail to know that I won't fail
Invisible shackles on the king, 'cause shit, I'm on bail
I went from selling out arenas, now shit, I'm on sale
Them cold nights starting to feel like hell, uhh
Watching a black woman take my freedom
Almost made me hate my people
When they label you felon, it's like they telling you they not equal
11 years going to court knowing they might keep you or drive you crazy

Look how far we came (look how far we come)
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream (yesterday)
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed
Look how far we came (I think I'ma dedicate this one)
To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign (Dreamchasers)
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, it was all a dream, on the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'
Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny, all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!
[Hook: John Legend]
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed

[Verse 2: Nas]
Haha, yo
I'm blunted, you wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em, Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your misses
Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is, mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now, transparent ceiling now
Nas and Meek killin', hah, wow! (Yeah, we did it, baby)
[Hook: John Legend & Rick Ross]
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
You dreaming of nightmares, you dreaming of nightmares
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed
Let's go

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali
Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's
Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler
I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter
Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thy mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban links equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on
[Hook: John Legend]
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
It feel like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed19Embed"

Chasing after green gods
Went from sleeping on the porch to a motherfucking California king sized
Momma ain't stressin' she know that its all good
My number one goal is to get her out the hood
Never changed, I be thuggin' hard in my section
Me and all my dawgs protected by Smith & Wessons
Any nigga playin' we comin' in your direction
Let you know that we ain't flexing, you quickly gon' get ejected
Niggas want to kill me cause a nigga coming up
Want to kill 'em but that shit might really fuck my money up
Focus on my grind gotta get the stacks
Tryna leave the streets alone but they steady calling back
You ever seen death around the corner
Chilling on the block and pussy niggas run up on ya
Busting shells at you and they hotter than a sauna
It be hard to think straight when its a lot of niggas want ya
Man

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Ok I've been the king for this rap shit
Stuntin' hard and never had shit
Remember me with them nappy braids?
When I was down on my last shit?
Bet them niggas wasn't mad then
Took advantage I asked them
For a shot at this, start laughing
It took a year or two and I passed them
Y'all niggas all look like haters
You ain't even put your dawg on paper
Word around that you tricking on bitches
Catch you with your chain on I'mma take it
Now everybody catching these vapors
Now everybody want and need favors
Southside, NY in Jamaica
Nicki on the bike throw it up, scrape it
With 100 niggas 'hind me
North side down in Philly where you find me
Riding 'round with a 30 on my lap in a big ass phantom
I whip the Bentley like a johnny
Watching out for the 2-11 robbery
Bang motherfucker for the money and the respect
Hit 'em in the head with the stick nigga eject (shit!)
Mo money, mo money, mo money, mo problems (shit!)
Why you think I really went and bought more choppers (shit!)
Mo money, mo money only bringing more robbers (shit!)
Want to see me in a box I went Porsche Boxster
Show me some evidence
Never was better than nor was you relevant
I'm too competitive
Walk in the club, get my .357 in
My level on excellent
I cut the brick like its cards and I shuffle it
You told 'em we selling it
A mouse in the building, I act like an elephant
Who the fuck just let the devil in
Come to my city they treat me like president
Ain't got no pity for niggas that's settling
I had that La La and Melo, was selling them nicks for J.R. Smith
Niggas try to kill me but they all miss
My down fall what they all wish
Had a lot of homies but they all switched
Word up my nigga
[Break: Meek Mill]

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something
You looking bad I prolly throw you something
I see you flexing with that money and I know you frontin'

I got all these chains and this change on me (we lit!)
Niggas said I changed man they changed on me (fuck 'em!)
Man it ain't a thang got the thang on me
Man I see a clearport plane on me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
You see me coming 'round your corner lookin' like I got a check
Flew into your city me my niggas on the jet
Ballin' every time I take a shot I hit the net
And everyday niggas want the money for respect
I ain't trippin' I got money, clothes, car, hoes
Shoppin' 'til the mall close
Lord knows, I could fit a brick up in these cargos
I don't fuck with niggas cause they all told
Worry 'bout another nigga money like they all hoes
I'm just with my niggas spinning hella blocks
Bad bitch on all my Banshee I'm like twelve o' clock
Vroom vroom I might do a hundred block
In the back hundred niggas deep and we like fuck the cops

I see these haters looking at me like I owe them something

[Verse 1]
Fuck your bitch, get a bag from her, then I never call her
Now she trippin', goin' crazy, nigga tell her let up off us
OGs see me comin' through and they say, ""That's a baller""
That's that nigga really started from the bottom really in that order
Make a call, bring them plans down
Smokin' loud like surround sound
Niggas wanna come around now
Cause they know that Meek Milly got the crown now
Put my mask on, put the crown down
Tell 'em turn up
When it come to action, niggas ride with me
Screamin' murder
Niggas fallin' off, bitches fallin' through
Callin' plays like an audible
Get that money, what you oughta do
Need the plug, got them niggas callin' too
Put you on, nigga, put you on, I can put you on
What you doin', nigga, what you doin', nigga, what you doin'?
Get the bag but I'm way triller
You around cause you paid niggas
In the dark when we spray niggas
When we run into you, we ain't playin' with you
Meek put a rapper on CNN
Niggas said I wouldn't eat again
I just counted 5 mil' in cash
I'm a real nigga they won't see again
[Hook]
Pray to my God we don't go to the feds
We don't go to the feds
I pray all that money don't go to my head
Don't go to my head
I pray on my Glock when I'm goin' to bed
When I'm goin' to bed
Now pray for the suckas that wanted me dead
Cause all of 'em dead! Fuck 'em

[Verse 2]
People locked me, put them chains on me
Wonder why I got these chains on me
Audemars, I got a range on me
Shit a hundred thousand ain't a thing to me
What's your range, homie? This another level
Flood the Rollie, get another bezel
She don't dig me, get another shovel
Go and get the money, we don't ever settle
Went to jail, came back home, then I got rich, damn
Went to jail again, then I came home then I got Nick, damn
Niggas prayin' that I go to jail again so they can pop shit, damn
Only trap nigga doin' real numbers spittin' hot shit
Niggas hatin' cause my numbers down, what'd you do, 50?
20 somethin', I did 250
MAC 11 hit you 20 times, now you Harlem Shaking like you Diddy
Pop niggas spittin' melodies when it's really nothin' they can do with me
Ballin' on 'em ain't new to me, fuckin' bitches ain't new to me
Summers, summers
10 summers I've been at my tempo like I'm Mustard
At the Grammys with the hustlers
Went to trap 'cause you a busta
Spillin' lean on the red carpet
Phone tapped, I hear the feds talkin'
Still trappin' out the bando
Moonwalkin' on that damn marble
Ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin', ballin'
Ballin' on 'em like I'm James Harden
I don't drive it if it ain't foreign
I don't fuck it if it ain't foreign
Still eatin' and I ain't tourin', nigga gettin' it
Got that ladder with me with the 33, I'm Scottie Pippen it

Catch you out in traffic, it's you and I
Gold 41 in a suit and tie, nigga it's do or die
Seen it now, if I lose it all like who would ride?
But nigga I'm so up, if I tripped it's like suicide
When the internet told me I'm crucified
They was in them streets like, ""Nigga you super live""
I was on the block when you was a sneakerhead
Nigga it's a check up in that box, ain't no shoe inside
Nigga ain't no Nike, ain't no Yeezy, no Jordan V
I came back like I'm Mike wearin' 45
Ever seen 50 grand when it's all in 5s?
But I'm shootin' like the Warriors' startin' 5, swish!
Only rapper went gold without a verse from Hov
Still got the rock with me, cookin' up at the stove
And the Rollie all platinum, know I bust it at Joe
Maybach in the hood, so them suckers can know
I'm in the 6, man, 6 man, Dion Waiters
And I'm on my level now, I'm so beyond haters
Bout to go and grab the Benz truck, see y'all later
When I came through the block, you should've seen y'all faces
This is slaughter, new world order
I be goin' hard, Westbrook, 4th quarter
This is hip-hop, you ain't write it, don't record it
I don't know how they gettin' down 'cross the border
I give 'em the dirty flow, Michigan and water
Sent them 10 thousand cases, I put in my order
Call that poppin' bottles when my people can't afford it
Mixin' D'usse with lemonade when I'm in Georgia
Views from the projects, and nigga I'm the prospect
Talkin' loud, say I'm shootin' out with metal objects
And that chick standin' right beside you, I done popped that
Made me beat a fan up, I'm feelin' like I'm Artest, woo!
Gold mic from the billboards, 'bout to plug it up
Tell Cruz put it in the booth so I can fuck it up
Got the hood super lit, jumpin' like it's double dutch
From the bottom like an uppercut, now I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
You niggas all the way fucked
Switched sides, now you stuck (stay over there my g)
Fuck them niggas though
[Interlude: Fabolous]
This is

They don't wanna see you on top
I just wanna see the streets up
They don't wanna see you up
That's it
They gon' take shots when you all the way up

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I guess they gotta aim up at you
But don't you let these nobodies get their name up on you
Keep the circle tight, never let 'em lame up the crew
If she for everybody, don't you let her claim up on you
Now listen, you gave up on me, I came up on you
Took my talents somewhere else, LeBron James up on you
I was Kyrie with the rock, the crack game number 2
Now I'm older, still ballin' like my name Uncle Drew
They tell you... stay the same, but they change up on you
Niggas change up the crew like hoes change up their boo
I just played the cards they dealt me 'til a change-up was due
Guess I had to switch the dealer or just change up the shoe
Now blackjack, Ace of Spade and a shot of Jack
I met a bad actress, she ain't know how to act
I took her but I brought her back
Don't want her back, I bought her bag
Matte like Hasselbeck, I call my car a quarterback
If I threw it at her would you doubt she could catch?
She hang like a chain so she 'bout to get snatched
Ain't about throwin' subs, I'm about gettin' scratches
But if the shoe fits, nigga, buy an outfit to match it
And you know my boys hold it, we be out with the ratchets
I heard your boys told her you be out with the rats
Keep that on the ""Shhhh!”, nothing less, nothing more
I know the Bad Boys in Brooklyn, they ain't with the Puffy tour
What's up with your Warriors? They ain't lookin' tough no more
Should get out your feelings bro, and get in your duffle, boy
Level up, level up, it's all about that level up
Hold that fuckin' bezel up and light this bitch all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up

Reason niggas die, they don't know how to live enough
They can tread water, but they can't swim enough
Nah, I'm built for the physical outing
Besides that, I'm filthy, like municipal housing
J all I know is 500, getchu a thousand
I be in all the hood spots you not allowed in
Opps in the building, automatically alert that
Hand on the wrist so the chrome don't jerk back
Pull it out, you already know you gotta squirt that
I'm all the way up I'm from where the phones don't work at
You gon' need the key from the lobby to slide up
You don't know the key to the body is mind up
Born with it then you don't gotta get signed up
Gotta go when you gotta go, your times up
Extendos, no need for keeping the 9's tucked
I'm kicking you off the ladder for trying to climb up
Yup, overlooking the city
I'm all the way up, I'm like Hov looking at Biggie
It's 50 in the bank, who rollin'? Shoot the 50
If I ace, then these niggas think they hit me
But I'm-

There’s never been anybody as ruthless. I’m Sonny Liston. I’m Jack Dempsey. There’s no one like me — I’m from their cloth. There’s no one that can match me. My style is impetuous.

Son you like you Ray Ray, nigga you ain't Bobby
Treat you like you Day Day, Deebo on a Friday, pussy
Somebody touch me then somebody die
Beat the body, throw a party like its Mardi Gras
I'm from Philly, nigga, all we know is homicide
Throwing millis tryna make a nigga momma cry
Brace yourself double barrel pipe
Do him like Caine's cousin Harold at the light
Weigh like 170, nigga, I don't fight
Do it with the guns or we can do it with the knife
Do this shit for fun, we could do this shit tonight
Cause we was never cool, nigga, you was just 'aight

Got birds for the twenty five K

In the Bent, leather looking like spalding to me
And I don't know what no line look like
Hundred bad bitches gettin' all in with me
Get 'em all in for free
Started, started with a quarter ounce of hard rock

Puffin' on strong, getting gold, bad bitches
Looking like Nia Long I mean it
Nigga I'm leanin', leanin'
Young rich nigga, I'm leanin'
Sippin' on promethazine that nigga
My team got money all season
Nigga I'm leanin'
[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Mmm, leanin' -- damn near spilled my semen (straight up)
Had a twenty-twenty on my preacher wife
Damn near see my demons (La Flame!)
Loose furs, hyenas
For the love of money and Selena
Vatos losing their nerves, bird niggas on the curbs
And let 'em pull up and do the Macarena (skrt)
H-town nigga spilled Peach Crush on my jeans (nope)
Never go far with no bitch with no condoms
Unless they can cover the lease on my Beamer (straight up)
Ahh, you know, Louboutins don't touch my hoes (La Flame)
Let's go down in Ibiza town
We get cold, you don't need no coat
Motherfucker, I'm leanin' (dope)
Don't talk to me, couple street niggas
Think twice before crossing me (oh no)
Meek, these niggas shit can't last that long
Why these motherfuckers keep bothering me (straight up)
I'm leanin', for a minute you had me
Then the second I caught it when it passed me
Oh no (straight up)
Somebody pass me a blunt and a double world cup
Motherfucker, motherfucker...
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Yeah nigga I'm leanin', leanin'
Young rich nigga, I'm leanin'

[Outro: Birdman & Meek Mill]
Yeah, straight levels to this life nigga
Parlay or nothin'
See we started trap before we was rap
And then we was, trappin' at rap
Shining on these hoes, high life
This what we live now
Blowin' out the pop
Italian on the floor nigga
You understand me
Stepping onto a mil' nigga
They say money rule the world, you can't pay God with it
Step your game up nigga
Or lose your bitch nigga
It's just that simple
[Outro 2: Diddy]
Yeah, we dreamchasers
We out there gettin' this money
So you can't fuck with everybody
'Cause everybody ain't at you motherfucking level
So the motherfuckers that don't understand you
They wind up motherfucking hating you
So you know what you gotta do
You gotta hate them motherfuckers too
Fuck them niggas

Posted on the corner with a 40 on my hip, Godzilla
We was getting to it when they hit my nigga Dean, that's when shit got realer
I was on the Southside really outside got guns got killers
Started from the bottom of the bottom now its bottles popping in the sky villa
Catch a body, be about it
I'm from where you couldn't talk you ain't be about it
I ain't really with the talkin', let's be G about it
When we catch you niggas slipping we gon' see about it

And yall niggas still hating on it, still hating on it

But I'm strapped up & I'm waiting on it
These niggas ain't built like that
These niggas get killed like that
Running 'round my name in their mouth
Banana clips get peeled like that
And they wonder why I feel like that
Cause every other month, I make a mill like that
Took my whole family up out that hood
Set 'em all nice in the hills like that, shit real like that

Come on let's get it
Ya nigga my album comin'
Dreams worth more than money nigga
This mother fuckin' summer
I been gettin' so much mofuckin' money nigga
Fuckin' all these bitches
I think I done took a year off
Still snappin' though
A lot of niggas fallin' off
We ain't doing nothin' but gettin' stronger nigga
New deals, new money, double M G Dreamchaser
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
My man got booked with a stone of white
If they make his bail a 'mil, he coming home tonight
I went from standing on them corners, jumping on them flights
Talking jumping out of Bentleys, jumping on them bikes
Middle of the jungle no strap, ice on
Niggas pussy in the dark, let's turn them lights on
I used to sleep on the same floors the mice on
Now it's Italian marble, moon walking like Mike doing
Rest in peace to Mike, I rest in peace the mic
I pop a couple percs, I drink that Easter Sprite
Its levels to this shit, dog you won't believe my life
Peanut butter jelly on a french toast, eating right
Champagne gargling, everything is marvelous
62 Maybach, I can barely park the shit
Got these rappers scared see em' shaking like it's Parkinsons
If they said my name they got flamed, I'm the arsonist
A man don't eat he gonna starve, a man gonna starve he gonna die
I know that they gonna try, that's why I stay strapped with a brand new mac and it's 45
So when they jump fast, better whistle like off-sides
Cause I'm from Philly, we'll eat your cheese steak
I told Diddy, I ain't walking for no cheesecake
Cause the jeweller making the band with the freeze face
I'm on now, I got neighbors like in 3 states
[Verse 2]
Do it for the vine, I ain't gonna do it
Lets talk about the time when I use to go through it
Nappy ass braids, with the cold shooters
We was playing with razors before they had the little scooters
Shit I walked in with my Pumas on, you ain't even know it
These a million dollar pair of sneaks nigga, you ain't even know it
Said Reebok dropped Ross, we ain't even know it
Cause he went and brought that Bentley Brookland, he ain't even show it
At 21 I wanted to pop a bottle
At 22 I wanted the hottest model
At 23 I wanted the Rolls-Royce
So what you think I did, I went and fucking got it
I hit my hood, niggas looking fucking sour
They see me rolling and I be like you fucking coward
I just want to ball, spending the quarter on y'all
Just take a look at my car, you don't remember I starved
I want it all
Back in the day, packing the K
All that hate I made that go away
I do you dirty go you back to the A
Put in the verse like that Mac hit ya face
And Philly nigga, I'm mac in the bay
I'm off beat still killing shit, I'm speaking all street still killing shit
Hurricane the first week, I still killed the shit

We rich already and my chick the baddest
This Rollie like my trophy, young nigga

When they needed motivation (What you do?)
I gave 'em hope
When my nigga needed money (What you do?)
I gave him dope
Every time we went to war (What we do?)
We gave 'em smoke
Fiends was copping, I was broke
Fuck that shit, we gave 'em soap
They forgot we gave 'em hope

[Verse 1]
I would spend time on that corner trying to stack me a hundred up
Strapped with that Glock with on my hip shit the coppers was running up
I look at these niggas and I can tell they are not one of us
I ride in the back like a nigga that can't ride the front of the bus
They had it segregated, bulletproof Caddy, I escalated
Stepped up in my game like a escalator
When you shine like I shine, you get extra haters
Seen 'em ride with the fake and I hesitated
""Wait, these niggas serious?"", or maybe Meek Milly delirious
Judge had to sentence a nigga, no period
I'm putting fear in these niggas, ain't sparing these niggas
I cut out your head with a hair on the trigger
Try to reach for my chain shit I deal with you niggas
I end one of you niggas, had the paramedics screaming, ""Clear"", on you niggas
Uh, back in the Phil, we gon' get to the money and stack up that dough 'til it way up
'Member them bitches? They played us back in the day like a Sega

Uh, look at the money and stack it up
I talk about it, I bag it up
You popping shit on your Instagram
Shit that you're popping ain't adding up
Shit that you're popping ain't making sense
I got fifty reasons say you're taking dick
And it's fifty reasons I should kill, nigga
But, for real, nigga, I been taking trips with my Philly niggas
Got the richest chick, she's from your hood
Niggas hating on me, I ain't really tripping, shit, I'm good
I be in the 40 with the .40 on me like I should
I be deep in your hood where you never be at
Be with them guys that you never could dap
You could never adapt
You know the game, if you cosign a rat, you forever a rat
We were never with that
You tried to go ""Money"" May with that paper, but now you in debt cause you never was that
Fuck is you high? You know better than that
Mention my name and Berettas with that
I move for real in these streets, in the world with that piece I'm like Metta with that
Fuck what you heard, I'm a get mine out the curb
I'm a just sit back I watch and observe
How niggas, they didn't ride the wave and they surf
I'm on my surfboard, this what I worked for
Mention my name, the shit your get murked for
Shit you get robbed for, shit you get killed for
Shit you get carried boxes into church for, oh

20 years on me, me and my army
Feelin' like none of y'all niggas can harm me
I came from the bottom where they never make it at
With all my jewels on they ain't never takin' that
Theres rules to the game I ain't never breakin' that
And once you give a statement, nigga, you can never take it back
You lame part of the game, nigga pardon the fame
I got 30 in my clip I can park in your frame
Plus this Rollie on my wrist cost some cars and change
We talking bike life, 'bout to put a park in my name
Just to ride on you niggas, or slide on you niggas
G550 when we glide on you niggas like
Clyde on you niggas, homicide on you nigga
I ain't never had no rap, had no ties to you niggas, so
Why you suckas hatin' and talkin' 'bout what I'm makin'?
When I be out in Jamaica and ballin' like I'm like a Laker
It's givers and it's takers, these niggas is gettin faker
And I'm just gettin' richer I wake up and get my cake up!
Black Maserati, chinchillas for Papi
Ten killers beside me, all lookin' like ahkis
I remember nights on corners with beef and broccoli
Rice and gravy, now it's crazy cause Phillipe's got me
All gold AP, same watch as Jay-Z
Ballin' like I'm KD, how can niggas play me?
If you ain't talkin' money nigga fuck you, pay me
Drophead with the top down and the A.C
On, drawn, fuck is y'all doin'
I'mma king you a pawn, lil nigga I'mma Don
The coke price high, it cost 40 for a jawn
And like 20 for a half lil nigga do the math
And you talkin' bout a battle rap, how you gon' handle that?
100 grand pussy nigga, you ain't got the tab for that
You ain't got the stacks for that, you the one we laughin' at
You ain't got half of that, they pump you up: Asthma attack
Bye clown, calm down 'fore you make me bomb now
Fucking all these superstars like ""Who Meek Milly bomb now?""
Went from driving Bentleys to going half on pie pounds
You niggas need to die down, Philly nigga: my town

You in the field tryna turn to God like Tebow
Naw that won't work nigga, that'll get you murked nigga
All-black Ghost nigga, looking like a hearse nigga
Been a dead man, so I'mma dig you out the Earth nigga
Just to stuff your skeleton right back into the dirt nigga

Ha! Get your hate on Cass
And we ain't talking larceny cause they all trash
And your goons ain't riding witcha, they all mad
Cause you ain't never put no food up in AR abs

Now you mad at Swizz cause you can't get a beat from him
Once my niggas coming at you dog, we gon' keep comin'
Weirdo Forest Gump nigga, better keep runnin'

While you was scared, I was eatin' chichi nigga

I just left your viewing at the Staples Center (I did)
Obama wrote you a letter, yeah, you made it, nigga (You made it)
I even heard you had some plans to come to Vegas with us
And them suckers could never kill you, it only made you bigger (Yeah)
And every time I see some fire, I see blue
And every time I close my eyes, see Snupe and I see you
When I be on the Westside (Westside), you know how we do (How we do)
Hustle and motivate, turning one into a two (Two)
Two into four, hurt my heart, I seen you on the floor
Do it for the hood, man, I don't even wanna do it no more
When these niggas you do it for, they'll shoot you and all
Only thing I can say is you with Allah, blessings (Blessings)
And I ain't finna sit here, act like I'm your main homie (I won't)
But when we lost you, it really put some pain on me (It did)
Got me scared to go outside without that flame on me (Brrt)
And when them niggas went against me, you ain't change on me (You ain't change on me)
Told me it was wrong or right, some of my longest nights (What you do?)
You made me cry, nigga (Cry, nigga), and I don't cry, nigga (I don't cry, nigga)
You the first one made me feel like I could die, nigga (Like I could die)
'Cause real niggas never die, you know the vibes, nigga (You know the vibes, nigga), yeah
Couple days ago, was chilling with my youngins
Seen your kids on the 'Gram, it made me sicker to my stomach (Made me sick)
And as the marathon continue, we keep running (We won't stop)
But I'm like, damn, I wish you seen that pussy coming, for real

I wish I knew when the storm came (Storm came)
How many tears did you cry when you lost someone?
We did this shit all for the gutter, woah, w-woah, woah
Did this shit for my lil' brother, woah, w-woah, woah (Brother)
Had to stare through these tears, 'cause I see you every time my eyes close (Every time my eyes)
Asking myself why you had to go, but only God knows (Only God knows)

[Verse 2: Roddy Ricch]
I was in Miami when I lost you, I ain't talk about it (Yeah)
I remember I bawled out in tears when I saw your body (Mmh)
And the flight back home, had cold days in LA (Hmm)
Had to turn off my phone, throw on the shades, and meditate
What you know 'bout wishing goin' blind to hide your tears?
Had a lot of murder on my mind, but in God, I fear
Took Yompton and Crenshaw around the globe in a year (Woah)
'Member ridin' solo, now it's Escalades in my rear (Woah)
I just hustle, motivate, be prolific, hold down the state

We back-to-back in Ghosts, playin' peek-a-boo
We went to war with Sosa over a brick or two
So for a hundred ki's, think what my clique could do
I'm talkin' clappin' toasts, bullets'll hit your roof
They hit his body he went in shock, no Pikachu
Niggas ain’t bout it they talkin’ but really pick and choose
We on our second strike, we ain’t got shit to lose
All my niggas is felons, all you niggas is tellin’
Sold your soul to them people, they gon’ get you to sell it
They gon’ get you to move it, they gon’ get you a Buick
They gon’ get you a wire, like niggas gon’ use it
You gon’ tell on your brothas, what a lame homie
I got a bullet with your name on it, and a full clip I autographed
Kids cryin’ at the viewing, I guess it was sorta sad

[Hook]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch
In God we trust
[Verse 2]
Lotta niggas act Tony-like
Told them D's everything you heard but that’s your homie right
But he got killers lurkin’ outside at your home tonight
They gon’ hit the crib and kill the kids, oh that’s Kony right
Oh that’s Kony-like, everybody bleed
Cuz he come out in 2060, Christmas Eve
First time he went to prison he ain’t get to leave
Feds takin’ pictures, niggas is rats, you should say cheese
Once a local dude, shit the fire now
Never ever spit a rap but he got bars now
I’m talkin fed time, yard up, yard down
Baby mama can’t pay the bills, shit is hard now
How that make you feel, you should pay them bills
Inmates spittin in them trays when they make yo’ meal
Niggas shittin’ out them packs just to take them pills
And his baby mama brought em in, boy this shit is real
Niggas turn to Muslim, niggas turn to Christian
They gave him life, he try’n appeal it, got him on a mission
His homies ain’t learn, they still in the kitchen
They firin’ bullshit, that coka ain’t swimmin’
It’s coming up short, no food on the fork
Niggas is catchin’ cases, niggas is goin’ to court
He done slaved in the field, you the one on the porch
With the gun in your hand, try and run with the man
[Hook]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch
In God we trust
[Outro]
Hey look, I’ma tell you like this
If you in school nigga, stay in school
If you got a job nigga, stay at work
If you a family man, stay with your muhfuckin’ family nigga
Cuz this shit ain’t meant for everybody dawg
Everybody talk that shit, until they get caught up in some real shit
And then they start talkin’ that shit

[Hook]
We done went to war with the realest, shot it out with the best
Talkin’ high-end guerillas, banana clips make a mess
I seen young niggas cry, I seen young niggas fold
I seen young niggas die because a young nigga told
For the love of the money, for the love of the money
For the love of the money, love of the money
Man, them young niggas hungry, for the love of the money
I seen real niggas cry, I seen real niggas hit
I seen real niggas die, cuz a real nigga snitch

Bout to make a movie starring me, the two of us
Penthouse at the top floor, elevator shooters up
So I can eat that pussy for breakfast, dinner, and lunch
And uh, she been waiting all night for this hard pipe
I think she called twice
Before you knew it I pulled in she seen them fog lights
And I can see it in her face she had a hard night
Up and down that pole selling dreams, selling love
It was sort of like she serving fiends and selling drugs
Giving them a fix, body solid as a brick
With no baking soda on it I went raw every time I hit
Life's a bitch but I go deep up in that pussy Jerry Rice
And every time I'm in the building I ain't never like
She be on that pole, tryna chase her goals
Going up and down like that angel on that Rolls. Lord Knows!

Yeah, Shorty so pretty and that pussy so good
She used to say I was crazy, I was up to no good
Till I slid all in it, started fucking her good
Red bottom, I damn near had a crush in the hood
I slid up in an Aston, she heard the pipes they were growling
Friends wanting to fuck me because they like how I'm styling
But I'm cool on the snaking cause I like when she smiling
We gon' Lear in the air just to get right on an island
We ball harder in Bal Harbour out in Florida
Isabel Marant sneakers, you got all of them
Tatted up, passports just to cross borders
She calling me daddy and I ain't got a daughter
Said I'm cooler than them other dudes
Five racks just to get her Cinderella shoes
Hella Jewels, Money come in different revenues
Big Paper, your money smaller then that Kevin dude

She gripping on my H belt, but I tell her grab it for me
She was messing with me way before I had the money
You niggas playing games, I'm getting Madden money
Just to commentate, peep how I operate
I put your chick up in this ghost, Bet she cooperate
I really balling, tat em all up in and out of state
Been getting money for a while, I don't know how to hate

It's so hard for me to sit back here, in this studio
Looking at a guy out here, hollering my name
When last year I spent more money on spilt liquor
In bars from one side of this world to the other, than you made
You're talking to the Rolex wearing
Diamond ring wearing, kiss stealing, woo!
Wheeling dealing, limousine riding, jet flying son of a gun
And I'ma have a hard time, holding these alligators back

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
These pussy ass niggas
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)
Ain't bout that life, ain't bout that life (you ain't bout that life)

Anybody wanna act loco?
Who you with? Numerous shots from the .44
Young nigga in the low low
Jumpin' out the thing with a little bad bitch like YOLO
.44 on my hip line, this time ain't no joke
In the hood where there ain't no hope
Now everybody ridin' dirty like it ain't no soap
Everybody get to rappin' when there ain't no coke
Where the money nigga? Cop 44 a bird where I live at
Probably buy the whole load if you get it back
Fishscale when it's stamped in the rental wrapped
Little nigga you ain't stuntin', give that rental back, oh
I like fast cars, fast broads and my last car was like a NASCAR
It go vroom, vroom, then skrr, skrr 'fore I blast off
She go up and down like NASA, bike life on your bitch nigga
Pop a wheelie all in that pussy, she switchin' gears on this dick nigga
Still young, reckless, and rich nigga, yellow diamonds like piss nigga
Stones they glistening nigga, ya'll suckas don't do it like this nigga

You ain't bout that life, you ain't about that yay

You ain't seen a dead body, I done held my dope thang
To seen the niggas who shot 'em in they own blood
Had to wipe momma's tears, she dreamin' I'm dead

Get inside tips, when your money long
Got big, my plan bigger

I was born poor, but I'ma die rich
Ridin’ in the 7 like I’m Pac in '96
Still rockin’ with the clique I had to grind with
Went to war, flip nickels and sold them dimes with
Yea, I used to sell nicks of reggie, nigga
I get the chills every time that Liv confetti hit us
North Philly skinny bull but I'm heavy, nigga
They switched sides they was never with us
And petty niggas wanna mention my name to get acknowledged
Hoppin' that we act like a fool and give them violence
I'd rather kill 'em all with success and give 'em knowledge
Then throw it all away for a sucker 'cause we the hottest
My momma crib big as a church, I'm bein' modest
No sleep, puttin' in work, that's how she got it

Now I got it, I'm drippin' in diamonds, a nigga shinin'

This one is for my youngins going to school with corner niggas
Don't get caught up in that boxing corner, nigga

Man I spent so many years at that corner store
I see my niggas disappear at that corner store
When they was sleepin' we was there at that corner store

Whole city came out just to see me rhyme
Started off in Impalas, now it's DB9
In the Aston like he James Bond, who he think he is?
Diamonds dancing all on me, doing the stanky leg
I hear them whispers, niggas talkin' what they think he made
Think what you want, you gon' think I'm paid
Should he be ballin'? I don't think he's safe
All I did was think and pray, I got young niggas in the grave
They got murdered by a nigga with some bitter ways
They don't give a fuck about us, put us in a cage
Let us out with that parole, man, this shit a maze
RIP to Snupe, RIP to Scooter
RIP to Dex, told him not to be a shooter
I tell Snupe, ""They don't love ya, they just want to do ya""
You see that truck? That's the feds watchin', not an Uber

Wasn't for this music, I'd prolly be dead
Instead I'm on top and I'm countin' this bread
Sittin' in the mansion, could've been in the feds
Drop top even with a price on my head, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

And they like shots! shots! shots! shots! Loso bringing by Ciroc

Wale said he on his way with Black Cobain and BOA

You little niggas do whatever make you feel bigger
Every time I'm around yall, something's a little fishy

What's your name, where you from? Almost done with interview
I'm into having intercourse, is that something that interests you?
Yes, no, maybe so, baby bro fix me up
Real house party shit now hold up your Dixie cup
With your other hand, do me a fucking favor
Put your middle finger up and say ""Fuck the neighbors!""
And Fuck the haters they never invited
They can't get on my level, my level is private
Who fly more than me? My level is pilot
My pockets stay fat, I'm never on diet
Don't be stuntin' out of town when you get on
I do you like Kid and whoop your ass when you get home

I'm thinking 'Ye should hit me up just say that shit is cray
Off the backboard playa, I enjoy to bank
Plus my people smoking on that pack, noise complaint
I murder beats and get away, it's First 48
But this the house of love homie, word to Courtney's place
20 racks a night, that's on merchandise
I'm rollin' up this killer, sippin' purple Sprite
Party hard then head to Europe on a early flight
Walking 'cross the London Bridge, that's that Fergie life

Every time I do a show it's like the Pope in town
And I call my girl Titanic, cause she go down
Hope she don't drown, bitch

You ever watch a dream manifest? (You ever watch a dream manifest? ...)
Real life
It's nothing like it (It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it, It's nothing like it)
DC2

[Verse 1]
If you ain’t got a dream, you ain’t got nothing
A lot of niggas changed on me when I got money
Said it came with the game, and this what I wanted
So I’ma hustle like the first time I got fronted
For the love of the green and the love of the team
Put together a circle that couldn’t come in between
Went from lint in my pockets to using money machines
I got my city back popping and they don’t want me to leave
No they don’t want me to leave
But I gotta go and get it though
Time is money and I’m on a mission though
Papi gotta eat, niggas shooting right around my mama way
Cops run in my sister crib, I swear I gotta find a way
Tryna touch a million dollars and I’m like a dime away
Never ask a nigga for a handout, I would grind away
Write my little raps, smoke my little weed
Sold a little crack just to fund my little needs
I was sixteen getting on my little knees
Asking the lord please help me get a little cheese
It was hard out (Hard out), same time it was yard out
In the jungle where niggas will rip your heart out
Cold summers where niggas’ll probably starve out
Wanna be a kingpin from watching niggas ball out
Could you blame us, they was tryna chain us
But we was tryna fix the roof leak when it was raining
We was tryna keep the house warm when winter came in
But they rather detain us, locked us in cells with strangers to raise us
Animals go in cages
That’s what the slave masters told the workers when they slaved us (They slaved us...)
[Chorus]
Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen)

Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen (Sixteen, sixteen)
Since I was sixteen (Sixteen)
I been waiting on this day since I was sixteen

[Verse 2]
R.O.C. man told us “Sun don’t shine”
You know if his daddy hustling then his son gon’ grind
His father was locked up, now his son doing time
When certain niggas get to starving, know that gun gon’ shine
Two felonies on his record, he got one more time
Get an app, picture that, he don’t want no job
Lost hope, some niggas don’t even want no God
They just want a little money just to come through fly
‘Cause nobody never listens to the broke nigga
‘Cause when you broke, you considered as a joke nigga
If you a joke, you considered as a ho nigga
And no nigga wanna live life living poor nigga

Small city (Small city), big dreams (Big dreams)
I been waiting for this day since I was sixteen
Selling white girl, I’m talking Christine
Young boy with dreams of touching that big screen (Big screen)

Shorty bad as my son is, pretty face and no stomach
Was the city’s most wanted ‘til I said gimme yo number
Youngest nigga I’m stuntin’, no more Civics from Honda
Money come in abudance, that’s the reason she wanna

[Trey Songz]
Lay up, lay up
Lay up, lay up

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I keep a vest on my chest, to cover my heart
I’d rather fuck in the light, ‘fore I make love in the dark
Cuz she was fuckin’ me right, it felt like love from the start
Was gettin’ money on tour, so we was lovin’ for fall
But first we go together then break up, tears drip on her makeup
Fuck all night ‘til we wake up, and like George Gervin we lay up
Cuz all them lies I made up, it’s big checks no pay cut
Floor seats in Florida, Heat game vs Lakers
Shorty on my team now, it was us versus them haters
And everybody they talk bad, when they talk that she take up
She Hermes all flavors, young boy get paper
And all I know is go hard, and every time I touch that ball I go swish

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (don’t miss), I don’t miss (don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Sitting back with this paper falling in my lap
Feeling isolated, nothing but them hundred stacks
When your money up tell me who you’re supposed to trust
Every night a different woman, fuck your money up
My bank account in shape, I could run with Puff
I came to put you down shorty so what the fuck is up
Since I met her she can’t keep that pussy off me
On the pill, I’mma kill that pussy softly
Back to back, time to show you how a gangster move
Keys to the pad, talkin’ infinity pools
V12’s ain’t a thang, time to change your name
Paper stuffed in her purse can’t hear her phone ring

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it’s gametime when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don’t miss (don’t miss), I don’t miss (don’t miss)
I don’t miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night

Homie, picture me rollin’, all them bitches be on me
They be fishing for compliments, I’m just fishing off Boca
Made a grip off them vocals, got a gift with the vocals
So much over these hoes, should have been on a poster
Infatuated to say the least
He lay it weak, I lay you once you lay a week
Wale a freak, he know it doe, no go with hoes
When it come to showin’, I am working with totem pole
That’s head on head, she give me head, I give her glow
I’m in her body, I’m in her head like quote unquote
The coldest flow, the flyest combination was voila
Au revoir to my rivals, double M genius shotta

Riding in the wheels of fortune, Pat Sajak shit
And all I rock is Balmain like I made that shit
I've been, front row fashion week looking like I'm in the show
Sitting in the foreign, leather softer than a dinner roll
Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role
You thought she was innocent, we laughing like she been a ho
Jumpin' out them Benzos, meet yo bitch in the friend zone

And I told niggas that I would expose niggas
Went to buy a pair of sneaks, landed at the Royce dealer
Brand new paper tag, haters never made me mad
You can ask your baby momma, I'm flyer than her baby dad
Looking at my neck, what that cost? Hundred-eighty cash
Looking at my bitch, she remind me of a Stacey Dash
We was selling rock before Kareem Biggs, Damon Dash
Oh you think you fly with your lil' Dream Chasin' ass?
We don't chase bitches, we chase money and that D'ussé
Cause when you get the money, the hoes do whatever you say
Riding in a drop head, Phantom with the toupee
And if you're just hearing this, then it's probably too late

And these hoes around me?
You don't fuck, you don't give them no check
Cause ya'll niggas lame as fuck, none of these chumps can hang with us
All these chains getting tangled up
And my clique armed and dangerous, and we'll flame you up
You get smoked mothafucker like angel dust
Start the Rolls Royce with the angel up
All these niggas on angel bruh, but I got stripes like a bengal does
And my wrist look like the flash on
Come that ho and bring that ass on
So I can beat it up like you stole something
Might pop a perk, go mad long like skrrt
Been through your hood in a wraith, niggas is jealous, just look at your face
.357 get put in your place, follow my lead all you niggas is late
Like hold up, hold up, I done made a million on that corner
I bought some coke but couldn't deal with Arizona
Them yellow diamonds looking clearer than Corona
And if they act like they ain't with it
[Hook]
I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
Made a million on that corner
I made a million on that
I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner


[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm on the corner gettin' cake
I'm talkin' like it's 88
Givenchy all I really play
Kingpin status when I swerve up on the block
A nigga like you, you wouldn't even get to cop
Get my money dolo, I just need some help to count it
I'm the richest nigga outta Dade-Broward County
Feds know my game, they keep it raw, we all at odds
Repossess my Lambo cause they wanna build a charge
When they got my Chevy, got it runnin' like it's 'sposed to
Hit up on my niggas, let 'em know my shop reopened
We rockin' everything, till I'm right back on the top
Nasdaq hustle bitch, come get your ass some stocks
[Hook]
I graduated from the streets, no diploma
I made a million on that corner
I mixed perico with baking soda
I made a million on that corner
Going Donald Trump numbers on the corner
I made a million on that corner
Graduated from the streets, no diploma
Made a million on that corner
I made a million on that
I made a million on that
I made a million on that corner

Really I'm the plug, really I'm the plug
Steppin' out in blood, walkin' through the mud
We got all the guns and got all the drugs
I went and spent $250 on my cousin's case
To beat his body, shit I coulda bought a fuckin' Wraith
But now he home, I make him put you on the fuckin' plate
So many hundreds, got them bitches fallin' out the safe, ho!
Money make them bitches swallow everything
Bought my chick a rock, that shit look like a wedding ring
Out in Philly, I'm like Pablo in the Medellin
Hundred bricks, we got 'em bouncin' like a trampoline
36s, 28, we sellin' pizza, nigga
If you ain't starve with the Chasers, you ain't eatin' with us
Shit, they was tryna ride the wave, jetskiing niggas
But I'm so stuck up in my ways, I don't be with niggas
I don't know them guys, y'all believe them niggas?
Headbands and double parts, do y'all see them niggas?
We the type to run up on 'em, try to leave them niggas
We really started from the bottom, unlike, we them niggas
You took her to an island, I fucked her on a couch
I fucked her in the studio, she never seen my house
She told me that you're lame, I told her clean you out
I got that pussy same day she made you eat her out, woo!
Was that my girl's tour or the world tour?

All that white like what you selling nigga
My chain look like a Coogi with all these colors nigga
I be on money since nineteen, twenty
I may be twenty-one I have bout 3hunnid
And I ain't talking bout Chief Keef or Lil' Reese
But all my niggas keep heat a little piece
With a drum on that bitch no chicken all beef
For you fuck ass rappers that be talking they all sweet
Last night I hit my hood with all my chains on
Two hundred fifty thou had a Mulsanne on
A broke nigga get it from me and his pain gone
But he'll never get it from me he'll get rained on
I tell em wear it to your funeral be stuntin' while they viewing you
Everybody goons 'til we send that 32 at you
Sipping on lean with the percs pharmaceutical
Just so I can get in my bag in the studio
Headshot we ain't shooting low
So many holes in ya they gone call you Julio
Oops I mean Hole-I-O, Holyfield knows he’s broke
Shooting at your Rolls Royce turn it to the holy ghost
Holy smokes, caught the whole thing that was overdose
Overkill watched the news so I know its real
[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
That's why I'm like fuck y'all niggas
Cause I ain't never trust y'all niggas
And I be like fuck y'all bitches
And I'll never cuff y'all bitches
Cause these hoes ain't loyal and niggas ain't either
When it go down you calling for hittas that you ain't feeding
You ain't real nigga
Your day ones ain't even still with you
You left them starving you an ill nigga
Same niggas you calling to kill with you
But I be in the field nigga
And when it come to money I get it
I fill up banks like Uncle Phil nigga word

Whoever got it never splurge splurge
Cause when the money going that's when all the honeys rolling
They gone kick you to the curve

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, when the money came all the hoes came too
These niggas started hating, I guess that's what fame do
And I remain who? Me! Still be with the same crew
None of my niggas don't fall out for bitches
They falling for money, we ain't you, we ain't y'all niggas
Started with a dollar and I turned that to a million
Now the Chasers in the building, it ain't hard nigga
I'm like oh lord what a feeling when you pull up
Drop the ceiling on them suckers that was watching while we starve nigga
They got fat and I got slim
So I shitted on them niggas when I got in
My homie caught me for some paper, that was not my friend
That was not my dawg, so it's fuck that nigga, knock him off

When niggas is hating they catching them vapors
And mad at favors that you ain't do
They gon' switch sides
I could tell you suckers want me gone
Before I let my mama mourn, you know I'ma let that shit fly
And I used to get it on
Selling crack till it was dawn
Moving fish, and I ain't talking 'bout no fish fry
And the reason they can't keep up, cuz when they sleep you know we up
We move kilos, then re-up
I do one lap, then I speed up
With your plan A, you couldn't be us
Or see us, when it's game time
And it's 4th quarter now let's D-up
I'ma be up, with my feet up
And I'ma eat up, every beat up
That they feed us, as a fetus
I had more stripes than Adidas
And my dawg told me don't ease up, kill these niggas
And when I do murder them all me and my Philly niggas

Mama let me sip the forty, I was just a shorty (Damn)
Then I started spittin' godly, then they said 'record me'
I feel like this shit was for me, this shit just my story (Facts)
Yeah, uh
Jumped off the porch, uh
I got a Porsche, won't take it back
I'm on the block with the killers and holdin' my own, of course (Yeah, check, check)
I seen my mom and dad separate, ain't talkin' divorce (Talkin' divorce)
Said daddy was livin' by the fire, and he died by the torch (Check, check)
I'm where the AKs is, we like the Bébé's Kids
Ain't have a daddy, I listened to suckas the same way that Ray Ray did
I'm totin' Smith &'s and HKs and I just was a grade A kid
Ain't have no guidance, we grew up with hitters and did everything they said
Point out the block, we spinnin' that (Spinnin')
Run in the spot, we gettin' that (Get it)
Give us some work, we flippin' that (Flippin')
I'm hittin' from jail, they ain't hittin' back
I need a lawyer, money for commissary, and nobody ain't sendin' that
I'm in my cell like, ""When I get out, I'm makin' a movie, no Cinemax"" (Woo)
Yeah, back home and I'm fresh on bail
Phone chirpin', it was next to Tell
Block poppin', it was extra sales
Big dogs, they ain't showin' remorse
I was beggin' just to catch a sale
Same block, we was goin' to war
I was prayin' I ain't catch a shell (Check)

Livin' like we tryna die tonight

Ain't have a will, now I'm flyin' Lear

Now it's rooftops and LeBron there

Thinkin' 'bout it, I was fine there
Came out the dirt (Dirt)
Dedicated, I was makin' it work
Medicated, I was takin' them Percs
Devastated when my niggas got murked
Educated, had to get to it first
I knew trappin', it would get me in jail
Playin' with pistols, it would get me a hearse
But I ain't give a fuck, send me to church (Woo)
Yeah, they gotta catch me in traffic (Traffic)
I ain't with none of this rap shit (Rap shit)

I always dreamed too, of being like, on like CNN and being able to like express myself
And, and, and speak for like the voiceless young men of America (Do it)

That's why I be at the jeweler tryna freeze myself
'Cause my heart so cold, we ain't got no goals
All these young niggas killin' like they ain't got no souls
Talkin' Grand Marquis, before I cop my Rolls
It was all so sweet until Dashawn told
Really hurt my heart, ripped my feelings apart
Out in Philly it's dark, we was really so scarred
But actin' silly so hard but we just wanted some love
Mama workin', daddy dead, I just wanted a hug
Why you think we spillin' spade when we go to the club
All my homies think I smoke, we just rollin' it up
I'm stressed out, niggas got Jordans, feel left out
So I went to chasin' them birdies, I went south, fuck it

Brought me to my knees back when everybody doubted
Can't let my youngins see me fold, I'm too solid

Racked up shawty, chain 'bout 40
Came in with one bitch, left out with four
Shout my homie Meek Mill, shout my homie Fabo'
Know the crib a couple mill', and I ain't trynna brag ho
That Coke Boy, that Maybach, that Bad Boy gotta stay strapped
That Ghost, fuck that Maybach, baddest hoes say that's that
[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty
All these bitches call me ""racked up shawty""
Racked up shawty, racked up shawty
And all these bitches call me ""racked up shawty""4Embed"
