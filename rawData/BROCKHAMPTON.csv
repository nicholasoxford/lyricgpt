Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up,” let the water run, let my body run

[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)
[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up

[Verse 3: Ameer Vann]
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
They said, ""Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?""
Or ""Do you draw the line for when it's better days?""
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me, ""Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?""
Or ""Do you draw the line for when it's better days?""
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why (Why?)
[Bridge: Joba]
Everything I have (Is a mirror)
And everywhere I stand (Isn't solid ground)
People don't make sense (To me anymore)
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out

I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky

I know it's hard but we need each other

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'

But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
Stripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf (Howl!)
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic (Haha!)
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings (Yum!)
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling (Uh-oh...)
What you mean, it ain't working? (What?)
What you mean, you ain't finding yourself? (Oh, I am, I'm trying)
What you mean, you ain't got no cash? (I got a little bit...)
What you mean? What you mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? (Uh-huh!)
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? (I guess?)
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? (No?)
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? (Eh...)
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say ""ugh!"", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep

[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Don't call me stupid
That ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid
I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyoncé will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honey-butter
Vodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honey-butter
Pouring lean in my Sprite can
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it

I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice

Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears

[Verse 5: Joba]
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
""You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street""
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to *NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Twistin' me up like licorice

I don't need nobody tryna give me shit

I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice

Rock the boat like a one-eyed pirate
Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like Ruth, man

Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel on the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me

Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it

Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zoro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever

Me Ilamo Roberto y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith
[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick, and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap, and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay; why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub' deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know, like, closet niggas, masc-type?
""Why don't you take that mask off?"" That's the thought I had last night
""Why you always rap about bein' gay?""
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called ""faggot"" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah

Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds

Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
(Go 'head, now)
I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
(Go 'head, now)
I took an eighth of them shrooms, and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
(Go 'head, now)
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them
[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer (Merlyn, Merlyn!)
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins (Again)
When I cut the veil, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn’t do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on a Lana

[Bridge: Matt Champion & Joba]
Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, ""why?""
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough, I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'
[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway, the cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death—all that
I hate these shady folk that want it ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin', like (""Just the tip!"")
And yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say ""Why not?""
Here to catch you slip up, wish you could just rewind
Timing all fucked up, thought you had just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, ""Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?""
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy
[Outro: Dom McLennon]
Ugh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak, they ain't skippin'

Go Obama when I drop mics

I'm the Black Tom Hanks
You can call me Nigga Banks

Nic Cage with the face-off
John Travolta when I take off

I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Burn my dress shoes in a fire with the wood
Sit back and relax with the fumes of

And I wait

They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman, boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that running back

[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft-shell tacos
Got down to pennies and ramen noodles
Now, I see how hunger make a shooter
Stamina, stamina
I used to be holding the camera
Head hit the glass, dog your window up
Fans praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang, but I feel like Santana
She twerkin' just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Made her my wife-uh
She can't kick it, she so Bella
Confused erections
Bad hoes know name brands, they brainless

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
These niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
""That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar""
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
[Post-Chorus: Merlyn Wood]
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
Call me King of the Niggas, I need a crown made of thorns
God said, ""Let there be light"" on the day I was born
Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage
I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain
I don't trust no niggas and I don't trust no bitch
'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth
And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend
'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, ""Get out the way""
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
""We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter""
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut

I know the future has been passing you by

They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for you
I'm taking a stand for you, I care for you
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
What's your motive with me, baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head, 'cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect, sometimes, I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages

But you don't love me like you say you do

I don't know where I'm goin'
If  I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'

[Verse 1: Matt Champion]
I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late  night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We  don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved

[Chorus: Deb Never, Merlyn Wood, & Deb Never & Matt Champion]
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my

Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed

Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
The pressure put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme
(That we all can find a way)
To anybody listenin' that's in between
(That we all can find a way)

Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here

Thirty-two hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else, I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la, when she strut like ""oh my god""
Make me sweat like exercise, double up, milkshake and fries
[Verse 2: Joba]
I heard a call from the mountain top: ""Joba!""
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from our village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jazze Pha]

Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can’t renounce me
Like la, la, la, la

[Bridge: bearface]
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie

Put it in the vacuum, I got love for my label
Fifteen million on the table, none of my niggas is stable
Need a personal connection, I just wanna feel you, baby
Bein' sober made me realize how poorly I been behavin', uh

Me llamo Roberto
Este es mi amigo Jabari
Nosotros odiamos a la policía

[Verse 1: Ameer Vann]
I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking centerfolds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I’ll send a bitch to get ya, so don’t play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money, I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I’ll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm, I love when bitches bleed
If she’s sucking on the barrel, you can’t hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet, this aggravated larson
And then I’m out the door, it’s monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome

[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck—another cracker
Cop comin' on my block for the answers
Huh, I no got time for your question
Huh, this pon' mi mommy and mi bredren

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I’m tryna change, but it’ll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain’t meant for life; but that’s too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I’m drowning
In the creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that’s on the fuckin' menu
I’m dancing with myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker
[Chorus: Ameer Vann]
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

[Bridge: Joba]
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you

[Verse 4: Matt Champion]
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should’ve shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the Lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it’s off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain’t clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it
[Outro: Matt Champion]
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I’m burning rubber, I pulled up on ya37Embed"

I pray I find you at the bottom of the hill
I  pray I make it outta Texas
I  pray my A/C come back on
My mom was stuck outside her job
My sister just asked for a Lexus
Can  Jesus send me a message?
What's  the point of havin' a best friend if you end up losin' him?
World don't view my text messages
World  don't view my text messages
Don't view my bad side
Only get on the 'Gram to show you motherfuckers the best side
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Why  I hide? Huh
Fourth grade, Mary J. Blige all I like
I made a mill' off a lie and a lie so I write another lie
RCA‚ that note wasn't 'bout y'all
No lies‚ it was about how me and my brothers been traumatized
And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells

[Chorus: Joba]
Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try‚ I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows‚ truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high‚ expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
How many sides to a story can there be when you saw it with your own eyes?
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
Find that truth trickles down, hits the fan
Freezes over like a dagger to the spine
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
If I knew what you would do to someone you owe money to, you wouldn't get a dime
Watch for where you land, sorry 'bout your plans
That was all a scam, you won't understand
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
And it's not my fault, and it's not my problem anymore
That's just where you stand
That's just who you are
That's your cross to bear
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfucker31Embed"

When there's a rough patch, don't eye for the parachute
They goin' AWOL the second that the light goes on
This a treat, ain't it, soon as she hit the powder room
I pull it back and check my rose, and yeah, I'm 'bout to bloom
It's that '90 raised from hell shit, parlay like when the lane switch

Neck twist like Exorcist, I'ma see you 'round

'Til the casket drops, I will play God

Don't act like I ain't been dead to ya
Don't act like I ain't deserve this shit
Couldn't last a day inside my head
That's why I did the drugs I did
Got issues with these motherfuckers
Looking down from they pedestals
From that petty view, on that petty shit
Pray for peace with a knife in my hand
Speak my piece like a gun to my head
Come equipped just to blast this shit
Misunderstood since birth
Fuck what you think, and fuck what you heard
I feel betrayed, you can keep the praise
And all of the fuck shit need to get away
Still ain't got the fright to the fickle-minded people

Should have known better, wish that I was better
At dealing with the fame and you fake motherfuckers

Break the dam when I spit the flow

Hoppin' out the van, I'm at Abbey Road
Fans with cameras in the bathroom, man, that's difficult
I just wanna smoke a Backwoods by my lonely self
Chill, watch numbers go up, book off the shelf
I found myself and put my face on a missing shirt
I dropped out with no promise that this shit would

I glue my hands together, life's got me hog-tied
There's no applause in the game of life, I just bought a car
And a new house, here's the cost to prove it
I spin a little wheel when I'm feelin' moody
And that's like all the time, try not to mind the clock
Because my heart is ticking, I smoke a pack a day and
I wish I didn't, having some trouble quittin'
I have a couple vices, we had that show on Viceland

Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me ""Decapitate everything for what it's worth!""
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah

Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
[Bridge: bearface]
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Boy, you know you don't look fly
Them gold chains turn your neck green, bye
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah

[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
Nothin' different now (woo!) all around now (woo!)
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible
[Verse 3: Joba]
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract & Jaden]
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us

Hoo! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn
Co-colonized Chris-ti-an
Now I'm losing my reli-gi-on
God damn, so narcissistic this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day
I'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?
If the service is an hour, I'm an hour late30Embed"

I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Joba]
I've got [censored], but you would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counseling, flipping off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilizers
But when I came off 'em, I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted, which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
Like all the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities

[Interlude: Robert Ontenient]
Estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir haciendo esto
Ojalá pudiera rendirme pero tengo que seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
I found myself getting better by the fucking minute
'Member when my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's, dropped out, wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head on Innervisions
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just ran into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kids tonight before them bitches run away

Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me

This for all my broke niggas, this for all them jokes, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I see you peekin’ through bushes
And tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us boomin'
Like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky-lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust, baby, I’ll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk, bitch
Still sittin' on your ass, waitin' for a handout
Giving nothin', put your hands down
""Ooh, yeah, this for the culture!""
""Ooh, yeah, this important!""
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep your mouth where the money at

But all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight

'Cause everybody got me fucked up

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga-lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I hate them quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me; ""Nigga""
I fight, I got suspended, my teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second-guessing my decisions, Black bodies come up missing

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things I always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived, and at what cost?
All the love in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault
In the lies of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes of my own, I ain't start yet

Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to

[Verse 1: bearface]
We were sat outside on the Harvard floor
With our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
I be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
And I see the names circling our thoughts
And I think about if we lose it all
And I turn to shit that you'd never want
Like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
And I'll say again, ""Sorry I don't call""
There's no money on my mind
But my money or my mind
What's the first to fall?
I never wanted this shit, yeah

[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when Auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said, ""I'll try vacation, I'll try to run away""
I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, then first flight I'm stuck in

[Bridge: Joba]
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My momma always had these dreams that used to keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family
[Verse 4: Merlyn Wood]
What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said ""Study or get that cash""
Mommy said ""Your career ain't gon' last""
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
(Somebody's gonna have to tell the truth and I'm gonna tell it!)

I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break what's monotonous

Man, I wish I had a rocket

Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
'Cause my president was Black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt-trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola, ah—
(Gimme that mic, nigga)
I got a hard time, I gotta watch myself
The way I move through a room full of suits, ain't no—
Ain't no Constitution, I hate uniforms (Hahaha!)
I hate handcuffs, I can't stand up (Shut up, nigga!)
They throw me in the crowd and tell me, ""Boy, I'd lose that smile""

Lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone

I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off (Scared)
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming

'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by, waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her, ""Why this world love echoing hate?""
She said, ""Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate""
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
It's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain
[Interlude: Joba, Sammy Jo & Tune Up]

I ain't the same nigga that I once was
I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
Hi, my name is Merlyn, I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school, hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase and a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke and whip an Audi coupe
Crazy, if I did that, wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pitfalls of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters and that make you feel accepted
'Til you walking 'round the campus and you the only African
Nobody with passion, just cats that take direction well
Take acid trips to find themselves, well...

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)
[Verse 3: Kevin Abstract]
Ever since I moved out, I've been broke
Ever since I grew up, I've been ugly
Ooh, I need get me some dollar, dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house
I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad and I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used, I miss my boy being around

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

[Bridge: Matt Champion]
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I gotta get better at being me (At being who I am)
I gotta get better at everything (At being who I am)
I just want a friend that I can hang out with (Being who I am)
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with (Being who I am)

[Outro: Dom McLennon]
I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point, I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table?
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels, what if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears, you wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your story45Embed"

Big old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you fooling? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?
There's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
Is you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you having fun?

Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

I said, I said ""Who that? Who that? Who that? Who that?""
Lurking in the shadows
Tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
They wanna blackball me, but I held my avocados
Then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
Circle tighter than the Castro, they feeding you Castrol
You'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
Could be stronger than Vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile
Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles

[Chorus: bearface]
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night

[Verse 3: Joba]
Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But something's gotta give, ain't that what they say
When you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
Or should've made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
I know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing

Building up an instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates

I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative, I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals if you still move like novices

Yeah, I'm ugly and genius

To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out

Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs

What's with these superficial people from my past?
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, ""Gather 'round, place your bets!
This young man won't ever be shit!""
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out any situation, but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Bloody leaf color like fall

Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th—th—they want to boot up my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year

Why do I care what they say?

You got an addiction to what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me, don't see you searching the meaning

Ayy, Dad, Hercules want his fuckin' waves back, stay strapped (Ooh, I like that, that's right)
Dancin' like a bad bitch, love on top my mattress
Hope the good Lord catch this, I ain't tellin' backwards
Lie just like an actor, Hollywood is batshit
Mama in the South still, gold all in my mouth still
Rappin' 'bout dick still, and I lease a house still
Move my nigga out, still need my nephew out here
God gave me a good deal
Miss my little niggas down low like a big wheel
Bitch, I wanna hit still
This shit for my partna 'nem, Devil keep on robbin' them
Express and feel myself, like I'm fuckin' Dennis Rodman (That's right)
[Verse 2:  Merlyn Wood]
Like I'm Dennis Rodman
Diamond dentures for my partna 'dem (That's right)
Golden rubbers from my pocket, friend
Ain't no answer, that's my partna 'dem (That's right)
She so bad, I let her touch my butt (Yeah)
Merlyn, what the fuck?

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Line 'em-line 'em-line 'em up, you know that I'm shootin' (That's right)
It ain't no one business who or what we doin’ (That's right)
Hit this gas, they break the glass and keep it movin’
To you basic bitches I know I'm a nuisance

[Verse 4: Joba]
Sugar, yeah, gimme some
Gimme dome, I'ma smoke some
Y'all ain't want the smoke, been smokin'
Garden gnome shrooms, y'all, who is y'all?
This what it mean to ball?
Okay, Chateau Marmont, Shangri-La
Valet park it, drive a shit whip
But I ain't broke, bitch
Write my own shit, hit my own switch
Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid
Tell it like it is
Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead
Texas 'til I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed
Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain
Screwed up from The Woodlands
Number six, been through Hell, think I'm Heaven-sent
Ask the preacher man, said I need Jesus, like I ain't know
Guess I found him, I am blessed, man
Rake in dividends, let the money stack, see you copycats
I ain't trippin', but copy that
It's a wrap, keep my distance
Where's Waldo, but we winnin'
Me and my dogs ain't finished (That's right)
The real know, what's a billfold?
You can't fold, I stay grinnin'
No peekin'
[Bridge: Henock Sileshi]
Go ahead and try harder
You ain't gotta ask to put up with nobody
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get on your damn knees
And pray sometimes with your muhfuckin' ass
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get yo' muhfuckin' ass on out there
That's all you gon' be, a muhfucker
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves

Too many things I'd rather do different
Woke up in a cold sweat (Ugh!)
My emotions creepin'
Three o'clock on the weekend, might as well sleep in
Stay down for the count when
She hit me with the ""what-ifs?"" and the ""what-whens?"" and the ""what-thens?""
Wonder where my life went, living in the moment
I been thinking 'bout my time spent
Are the bills paid? Is it make-or-break? Will I find a way?
Have my feelings changed? Will I be okay? I don’t know
But what I do know is, life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent, so I place my bet

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away (Yah)
You left a spell on my Saturday

[Verse 2: Ameer Vann]
I got cracks in my phone screen
The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in The Woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas, ""Come and find me""
Gotta say it in my eye-view
New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running out of issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kinfolk
[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
Taking a book out the page of the greats
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talking the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just 'cause I can't relate, I don't debate
I educate, illuminate
Or we can't duplicate, no more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated
Unappreciated, so I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothing better than some time with you
Because it's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you, you find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]

With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' (Woo)

Baby, when the karma gets you, yeah
Maybe you can run away with us

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
In my bag in the vault, moving on, move along
Ain't my fault, moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt
Got back on the road and made it to the start
Disregarding the emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission put into my heart
I ain't playing games with you to play your part
Standing up with pride behind my battle scars
[Verse 5: Matt Champion]
Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big-ass house and big-ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life, highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut, really know the place
Projecting on me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawing on my wood like a termite
Entering my world like a parasite
(Parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite, parasite)

[Verse 6: Joba, Kevin Abstract]
Praise God, hallelujah! (God, God)
I'm still depressed (Damn, damn)
At war with my conscience

Immersed myself in discontent
Hopin' you can only repent these things
It smells like ginger

[Verse]
What you mean, I ain't green like Timothy?
Dead leaves in the breeze‚ sweep your chimneys
See the boy try me‚ now the boy deceased
They put the blame on me‚ but hey, it wasn't me (Boom, boom‚ boom)
Like God can't judge me, but only God can see
I ain't bein' judged, no one judgin' me
I walk on water‚ pain and torture what I bring to these
And there's a war in my head, just like the Middle East
And I'm the flurry, vision blurry, see soliloquies
I didn't get the memo, didn't CC me
Only CC me when I'm doin' burglaries
And if it weren't on TV you wouldn't have ever seen

[Chorus]
Fuck God, I'm a dog backwards
Backwards, I don't smoke Backwoods
What you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?
When you wanna get money, get them riches
Like what you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?
Whole lot of shit and some bitches, like

Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice, wonder who on my side
Life always better keepin' two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We be in Van Nuys, black van with some white guys
Keep your hand out, waiting for the appropriate time
To ask a question like
""Could you perform at my best friend's birthday party?
With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair.""
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet

Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me, guess it's Holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade (uh-oh)
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car (honk, honk)
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong, bet I get along
Make some commas, karma, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, butter knife like dancing on a knuckle
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter, I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the Volvo
Damn, shoot 'em down like, hmmm, sorry, do it all here

I'm moonwalking on the sun hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandana, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
L.A. turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm livin' different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me

[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
I just want a friend to fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playin' my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where to bust it
Cry nigga, gotta fuckin' kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
Putting my ideas where my chips at

But they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose, ones I loved would make me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top
Just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college, smoking the same campus
Tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal, took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid, huffin' with my boys

My fuckin' Power Rangers couldn't protect me from that LAPD kick door
Motel, pig-pork
Swim through the living room, straight to the bedroom, lookin' for bricked dope
My papa looked at my mama, lookin' at that closet like
""There that shit go""
Two keys and a thumper, 10K with the mustard
A whole family and no buster, this don't add up
My padre facin' them three strikes
And my mama just smacked the pipe
Crack smoke got crash tight, this shit still bad, 'cause
The boys peeped a Brillo pad and some glass tucked
And it's lookin' like my parents was up in here runnin' all through that stash dumb
But the fact, crack different than coke
Plus the smoke wasn't close enough to choke me
Lowered scrutiny so mom could kick big facts for bruh
The truth is we held the bag for this kid we took in
Tryna part with his old ways, maybe we all mistook him
'Cause I knew something was fucked up when he said
""Don't open or look in this here satchel that I'll be back for in just a couple of minutes""
Then hella hours later, like do I cook dinner now or later?
Worried about cold food for a cold fool
Motherfucker put my family in danger
I blame myself, pardon my anger
I never looked inside his stuff so he never really needed to hide his stuff
When you showed me what was really inside this stuff
I never had a clue
Now I know as police, you gotta do what you gotta do
But this my family, all I got is us, my nigga
My own mother just shot at us, my nigga
This is why we here
And I don't fuck with niggas I don't know
But I had a heart to help this kid in danger, tears in anger
Gemini gettin' violently
Police silence don't help anxiety
My daddy's priors tame all of his wildin'
All of these pilots, not one of them flyin'
Y'all planning on trying?
This flight is diving, nose tucked
Po-po stuck, play your part
All this commotion and neighbors listenin' like, ""Oh fuck""
Shit finna spark
All this emotion, need a decision made with some heart
'Cause ours is broken, they tryna lock the third notch on my pop's choker
This shit ain't kosher
Moms is oh for if CPS get sent them pages
I ain't gon' see my parents for ages
All this erosion, no more protection
Shit don't feel safe
What graduation? What degrees?
What dissertation? What imagination?
Imagine my whole world taken away from me
All over some bass and misconstrued melodies
My heart racin', clutchin' my red Ranger, pacin'
I can barely breathe
And mister policeman, told policeman, we got what we need
Just let 'em be
[Chorus: Ryan Beatty]
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance

It's like you barely even know me

Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like Field Mob song, Trill Mob boy
She been MIA far too long, so far

Change the conversation, dollars all I'm chasin'
Ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?

No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended

Fuck the opposition, plus I'm still ridin' with it tucked
They say I should change the way I'm livin'
But just can't get enough
Still be quick to up that chopper on his block and hit him up
My little brothers don't come home 'til November

Can't do shit but pray for J Ron 'cause that nigga don't give a fuck
Not at all, nigga
Had my back against the wall, nigga
Momma told me I'd see it all, nigga

Yeah, who love you at your lowest of lows?
I know, I mean
I'm in the backyard thinkin' I need
That smoke puffing outta my teeth
I'm good, I got my green
Sittin' back, sippin', ocean breeze
I don't got it baby, ask them boys
All that hating turn to white noise
Tryna get red carpet fly
I don't flex my life, I don't lie
Treat life like I might die
Don't like myself sometimes
But I bet that come with time
Ever feel like your head got screws a little bit loose?
Goddamn, give a fuck if I lose
Ain't no fool, he got déjà vu
I'm the man, I'm the dog, got juice
Just know I fucked up, too
Talk like you got it figured it out

What I gotta do?
Keep it real with you
Stuck inside my truth
Spendin' all my loot
Diamond on my tooth
R.I.P. my brother Luk
When I spit, let it hit, hit a double U
Couple rainbows, my lil' halo
Think it's J-Lo, bro don't say so
Homie don't play, no
Takin' my day slow
Takin' my ray, throw
Talkin' to angels
Speedin' a pave' though
Changin' a page though
Lookin' like ace, talkin' 'bout spade, you are afraid though
Spendin' my queso
All on some fake clothes
When I change, never say, this is my blaze throat
South Central
All my homies know
If I could go, I would just wait though

[Verse 2: Joba]
Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced (Uh-huh), insane
[Verse 3: Merlyn Wood]
Piss 'em off, piss 'em off, piss 'em off
Shit, I better set it off
I just made a deposit, CDG in my closets
Fuel ain't really made of fossils
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
She wanna know why my wrist so rocky
Flash splash on me, photocopy

Shoot me a sheriff for Trayvon Martin

Avoiding social litigation
When that admiration turns into abrasion
Y'all can find another station
Otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
Rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
Told my baby I'd be back in November
Did some Beatles shit to kick off this September
Crazy 'cause in 2010, I had some old friends
That thought I'd be another—[censored]

Looking like an inflatable at a car show; a spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind

You hung yourself, that's not my fault

Used to fly standby, late to the airport

Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then

This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder

'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank, you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I’ve been tryna avoid from before I was born
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle I saw on the wharf
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me, and I never let them fuck me

If your perception ain't ascending, it's no reason for extension
Of my energy, this shit only happens once in a century
It's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary
Paradiddles hidden in riddles; vapid and accessories—
So please, don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken
Didn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this thing
Ain't no acting complacent, the disrespect been too blatant
We claimed this spot from the basement, so tell me, who you again?
Oh you was this, you was that? But now you washed, and you hate it?
You taking shots with revolvers, I got two drones at the station
Hit the button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant
You paved a path we didn't want to get demolished with aging

Early two-thous, they tried to jump me in, Latino protection
Any direction, you gave me your blessing
Texan, I text him, I told him I got him
Told him I made it to Hollywood, all it took was a summer to fail
A platinum record not gon' keep my Black ass out of jail
Truth prevails, this is real, miss my brother
I love my mother, drove all the way to Cali’ just to check up on me
Made her go home, felt the virus
Web of life is my weed, false dreams stripped by silence
Deals they had us sign, for years, it had mе blind
Think I had to hit rewind and think about why I do shine
Got my cousin doin' time, hе was barely pushin' dimes
My whole family cursed, now get the fuck out my ride

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin', nothin'
Now, get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I (Get the fuck out)
Fuck with me, give no shit, guess my ignorance is bliss
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
Nothin’, nothin’, nothin', nothin’, nothin'
So get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
If a killer say shit, then get these motherfuckers— (Get the fuck out)
[Verse 2: Danny Brown]
Live from the gutter, blood like red paint spills
You niggas ain't alpha, you're incels
You normies ain’t a part of the script, doxx your house with Crips
Pop shit, now you got content, constant
Where to begin? A veteran with medicine pen
Let 'em all in, treat 'em like they next of my kin
Checkin' your chin way before the record begin
Niggas blow a lot of smoke like they breath in the wind
Ain't no pretend, tell you how it is, how it go
What do you know, when you start escapin' your soul
White on the street, walking the beat like Abbey Road
Truth be told, no such thing as real nigga mode
Through the lights, camera, action, glamor, glitters and gold
Unfold the scroll, plant seeds to stampede the globe
No peace on the street, so I'm clutchin' my heat
Gotta watch for these savages roamin' the street (Go)

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract & Jabari Manwa]
I- I float (Go)
I'ma see ya when I do
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide, yeah, I
(Yeah, nigga, we back up in this thang)
Now get the fuck out my ride
—ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide-ide
(Yeah, new machine)
They said I'd never, ever see the sunlight (Tell 'em)
I thought I'd never, ever see the sunlight
They said I'd never, ever see the sunlight
[Outro: Joba, Kevin Abstract, & Merlyn Wood]
Sometimes, it drives me crazy (Look at the sky!)
This all I got for you (Niggas!)
That sunlight, it'll drive you crazy
What is God to you niggas?

Shit, high-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shawty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator, I ain't sayin', I'm hittin'
I was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you
I'm wonderin' if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through
With your fine disguise, yeah, yeah

Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la

We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy? (that cray)
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DMs on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?

It's different reconciling with skeletons I ain't know I possessed
I sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept
I understand what I neglect in times when I obsess
I'm learning to confess, this fate is harder to digest
The biggest threat I'm up against is who I face in my reflection
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting
Can't help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace
When I know that it'll kill me if I give into my brain
I see the shadows inside, they ten feet tall with no eyes
They put my head in the water and it's so beautiful under
The sun reflecting off the corals, colors I can't describe
To make the darkness divine

You ain't got drip like this, can't talk like this (Woo)
Safety pin on wrist, I put racks on my lil' bitch, uh
Speak of the truth, two K a tooth, oof
Maybach Jeep, huh, raise the roof
Know that you envy me, but I am hater-proof
Talkin' with Diddy, I made me a milli' in about a day or two
Woo, ayy, filled with lust
Wanted to hear what Hype Williams talkin' 'bout
Bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talkin' 'bout video treatments and such (Damn)
But I'm busy lovin' on the IG, smut, damn, fuck
I'm a G.O.A.T. in a Lamb' truck

Won't take off my armor now

Just to come talk to ya
Who hurt ya? I'll break his jaw
Young, handsome, with major plans
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
Know I'm harsh to my consonance
Make her run like the Boston bomb
I'm the one, yeah, the one she wants
Wanna love me like Wimbledon
Raise the volume, ring alarm
Hands on my girl, it's a charm
Got passion, don't call it loud
Don't tell my shorty, ""Settle down""
I wear out like a hand-me-down
Don't say I'm too big for ya
Man, my head big, it's fallin' off
But I fit, no problem
Make it fit like nuts and bolts
One nut and I'm boltin' off

It got me lookin' legit and they know it (Yeah)
Yeah I'm countin' up, ain't gotta show it off
See me in your spot, low-key throwin' you off
If you talkin' 'bout cash in my ear like a kitty

Always wanna change
Used to count my change
Everybody changed

Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase

Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd

Fear one day that I'll make that call

Find my ways to fly with everyone, I lost when I'm dreaming

You made me do things I don't ever wanna do
You made me say things I don't ever wanna say
You ain't act ways that are natural
I'd rather end up in disaster
Imagine me and you outside
When the wind can't hurt my pride
Imagine me and you in a car crash
Imagine me and you shared a last laugh
Imagine me and you hold hands
Fake ass romantics
Like all the niggas we stanned
Think that's a classic, damn
You let me share your couch with you
I thank you for that
You let me share your house with you
I thank you for that
You let me wipe my mouth with you
I thank you for that
You let me write my songs about you
And I hate you for that

Take it all, or leave it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts
Your motives and all of your reasons
Two albums every season, what the hell do y’all believe in?
Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see ’em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was that nigga in a room
With no motherfuckin' cable and no table
Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
Cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
You don't understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it
[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I don't speak like I used to
I’m thinking of a way to change the world that I move through
I feel like Nikola, what I invent is what I’m true to
I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through
I know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you
It’s hard to feel what's real, some nights I'm scared that I'm delusional
I’m scared I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to
I'm scared of what can happen when ideas will consume you
'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya

Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)

Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time (You can pick me to pieces)
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it

[Verse 4: bearface]
Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah, yeah

I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
I've been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back
Lovin' me and it keeps hurtin' me
I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on, right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, I call to God
Selfishly, I keep it all for me
Usually, I don't wait too long, but for you, I might

I can barely rap, I can barely dance
I can barely laugh, I can barely hang
I need a male stripper, do a belly dance
For me and my boyfriend, that's entertainment
And I'm drunk as fuck, my nigga sucks up
I need a reason to get my bucks up
I need a reason to care about society
They need a good enough reason just to hire me
But honestly, you see my mom can't walk
And her lungs don't work like they used to
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music
I be saying shit that's just fucking rude and untrue, and
But truthfully, your words had damage and it's cruel to me
But even more cruel to be
Dissing you in front of niggas that pay to hear me

[Bridge: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off it
I should probably spend my time
Writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds in one stone
When I was younger, way before I was grown
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers
I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later
I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists
They hate truth, they hate peace
They want my niggas to burn with us
[Verse 2: Joba]
Flicking on the face of my wristwatch
Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one-way
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lying, don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with tragedy after tragedy
God, send a message, send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light

[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later?
Like she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains like, ""You lucky where you at""
""You cool, but quit complaining 'bout all that""
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For my shell, fuck the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at? Four-cylinder go round
Lincoln Town Car pick me up, drop me off
I got bubble under my biceps, sneak me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?
Wondering ""Who is me?"" now, wondering where you been now
Lose you in crowds, I see now, 14, I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account move like speeds now, make it from ways to feed now
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now
[Verse 4: Dom McLennon]
It's crazy how things feel the best
When reminiscing 'til we check ourselves
It's crazy how people who left
Say they feeling left out when we step for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember to call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight, it ain't right
Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night
Until I'm forced to close my eyes
Brain disease, parasite, eating me from inside
Emotions bleed, I can't believe

I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something
That I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip
I tripped and I fell, still think I'm living in Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit
When I thought the automatic had an answer?
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a Cancer?
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan
With a whole lotta mela-nahn
Sendin' bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name

We colonizing the moon, I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you, sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights, they all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall, I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me, building a story to sing

I give, my mom so, —mess
In the same house my dad died in, all alone
Tryin' not to be paranoid, tryin' not— as they're calling it
'Cause every headline is a reminder that the world's fucked
So I'm just tryin' to see the light
In between the clouds
Still love that sunshine

[Verse 1: Joba]
When I look at myself, I see a broken man
Remnants of my pops, put the Glock to his head
Nothing ever go as planned, couldn't make amends
Forcibly pretend I don't give a damn
At a loss, aimless, six feet deep
Suffocatin', can't face it
Can't change it, ain't make it
Master plans by the Maker, I see no savior
Morbid reflection and stainless steel, alcohol and pills
Deadly combinations left with nothin' else to feel
A floral haven, hope it was painless, I see you in the faces
Places and my making, reflections off a broken mirror
Fragments of my fear glarin' back like, ""Who's there?""
I can't stand myself, beside myself, I see you there
I know you cared
Felt numb since September when I heard the news
What I'd do to speak one last time
Think I always will be haunted by the image of a bloody backdrop Skull fragments in the ceilin', felt your presence in the room
Heard my mother squealin'
Master of disguises, ash to ash, dust to dust
Voids behind my eyelids, blacking out, bleeding out
Silence louder than a twisted tongue lying
As sick as our secrets
Shadow people and needles fading through a peephole
Bedtime stories from purgatory, I miss you

For the record, I can fly
Around the world absorbing light
Something's missing deep inside

Ain't no love in this game, mama, this is not tennis
Take your shoes off, we just did the carpets in

Losin' jobs and losing God, then everything is tumbling
Feel Heaven rumbling, the rapture is coming

I still struggle with tellin' my mom who I'm in love with
Subtleties in between, way these diamonds gleam
When Thanksgiving come around, I still don't see 'em

My male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up, I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does, and like my teachers would say:
""Little Black boys have a place in the world
Like hanging from trees, or dead in the street""
Like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end

[Verse 2: Dom McLennon]
I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey; see, your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to merit
Y'all fetishizing my spirit, I see your culture’s dependent
On what you didn’t inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant
[Chorus: Kevin Abstract, Merlyn Wood]
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?

Bitches, they don't know how to act now (Merlyn)

[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood & Kevin Abstract]
The poor more polite, but thе flow not nice (No)
Watch for your wife, I might take hеr out your life (You know)
She wet my white tee, now it's like a wet wipe (Wet it)
Respect my Tribe, I'm a dog like Phife (Get it?)
You love me like a check, but my name not Nike (Get it?)
Bitch, my number not a lottery
I'm like, ""Don't even talk to me"" (Stop)
Honestly, wouldn't fly a Melbourne chick to Sydney, no (Go Merlyn,  Go Merlyn)
All of these bars bought chains, prison industries (Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn)
True, America did my people foul, then give me shot for free (Go Merlyn, Go Merlyn)
While I watch Washington's wooden teeth in her booty cheeks
Kings of last century, was living like peasantry
I don't even like sleep, time is the only luxury
[Verse 3: Matt Champion]
Sendin' a fuck you to you all
I'ma ship it, laminate it, got this shit straight off the lot
We ain't renting no AVIS
Got the neighbors going crazy
It's me, Bari, and Flexy
I can see through your bullshit, like your face was made of plexi' (Haha)
I could fuck around and get to soundin' like I'm whinin' man
Only crybaby is the one inside the buggy, man
Who, I'm the bogeyman
You, never sleep again
Nightmares, it's fright-filled the moment Freddy tuck you in
Stack my money higher than the foam atop a tidal wave
Lonely like the point guard at the key, got the isolate
Light it up, light it up, we bring the light show
Who the hell invited all they friends?

My pen could be a fortune teller or an ATM
It's got intentions of its own, I can't even pretend
Every moment is a fight nobody can defend
The circumstances should've never been there to begin
I watch the clocks melt as the Devil dances
The chances are slim to none that you could understand this
Lost language we incantin', pain campin'
Amongst the stillborn raindrops is where I'm standin'
I wake up breakin' up an eighth just to function
Rather be in neutral than continue to get sunken
All my niggas made it out the motherfuckin' dungeon
Tank has been on E, but I gotta keep runnin'
What you finna lean on when our system is crumbling?
Everybody's reaching but they really end up fumbling when they touchdown
Y'all don't appreciate in value like a bust down
My shit authentic, they can never get enough now

I can see the eye upon me when I close mine
Drug-induced comatosis leaking through me blind
The body is the temple, I invite spirits
We crack riddles and giggle behind closed blinds
Born to bleed, the brave and free
Got needs they gotsta feed, I breathe to see defeat
Fuck police and authority
Never means nothing, mind-fucking myself to sleep
Had to take it to the streets
Capitalistic greed plague all society like COVID-19
Those dirty hands that feed don't buy it
Government officials, don't give a fuck about the children
What do you believe?
Nothing's ever what it seems 'til you can't deny it
Flashpoints and flashbangs dictate defiance
History stuck on repeat in the loop of sirens
Terrorizing, always lying
Goddamn tyrants
Don't play with knives, kid

Outside, comin' for you

The envy so green it should be flying a saucer, yeah
And when the pressure is on, they gone

Then show me where the hash at, fuck that

I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bedsheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
(There's not a soul in here)

She know not to call collect if she go to prison

Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tail
Send me a pic whenever it slip, hoping this outflow my scales
Full throttle whenever I blaze, fifty mil', put it all in my will (There's not a soul in here—)
Human, I see through your eyes, until my CCC wide open to my skin

Bustin' out the bar, human of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back (There's not a soul in here—)

The light

[Chorus: Joba]
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it

[Verse 1: Kevin Abstract]
Sick of these niggas givin' me false info
Like I ain't grow up on MTV, Boondocks and The Chappelle Show
Bitch I can handle the truth
That's how I entered the booth
Look at all these bruises I got
It gave me so much confidence
Back when I was makin' songs at my momma's crib
The candle's lit, the temperature rising
What type of man can find the right time to fly in
Especially when my cousin dyin'
Should've never sold my soul
Should've protected all my opinions
To see the world move without you feel like a daydream
Kool-aid stands, band-aids wrapped around your beautiful hands
Protect me from the city
Couldn't save me from the world back then
Had Jeezy on repeat in your whip
No peace in my streets
And these days, no license
Only take the Jeep if my boyfriend is drivin'
Plus he got the kinda skin that make the police like him
Ever since I was a kid, I always felt so frightened
My momma from the ghetto
Her vote go to any nigga that keep Jesus in the convo
Me and her just get on good terms
Thank God for them unexpected turns
Breaks her heart when she see my city burn
Thank God for teachin' me how to learn to have empathy even when it burns
But I hate that you got me in this box expecting me to see the light
See the light, see the light
All my niggas to the right, right, right
You see the light, light, light, light
And all my niggas to the left, right
Left, right, left, right
You see the light, light, light, light, light, light
[Verse 2: Joba]
When that hammer pulled back, did you think of me?
You were the one that taught me how to be
Look at me now, in all my glory
Overcame a lot, that's a different story
Abandoned by the life-giver
Looking back at my life different
Deep cuts in the dusk of the final gasp before your life flashed
What happens when you die?
Does it fade black?
I sense you in my skin and the trucker cap
Miss it when we laughed
Didn't trust my intuition when I saw the cracks
I'm sorry
All I ever want to do is make you proud
Fleeting moments
Always found a way around the frown
Set aside the pain to celebrate the now
Couldn't kick me out the house, I was fucked up
Nothing to prove without doubt if I'm man enough
What's the use?
I could use you, 'cause I'm scared as fuck
Tuck me in
Always young enough to feel loved
And share some
Are you lookin' down?
Inner child reachin' out
Brittle-boned crying out
The past does not define you
The past does not define you
The burden was too much
Couldn't save you from yourself when you'd self-destruct
Couldn't save me from myself when I'd push my luck
To tell the truth I am just like you
Left it all in the pistol that you used
Always be your little man
Following your footsteps even though I'm mad
Even though you're gone you live on
And the day I have kids I'll tell them 'bout grandpa
And how great he is
And the grandkids
Grandkids you'll never meet
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't be
Neither would they
It's safe to say I'll find a way out the darkness
The way you left Ma hits me the hardest
What a shame things change in the blink of an eye
Fade away, fast break to the depths in the sky
Impermanence turned permanent with a 9
That's life, that's life
[Chorus: Joba]
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Why did you do it?
The light is worth the wait
I promise, wait
Screaming please don't do it

Tossin' me through a loop

If you niggas ever get your money right
Would you still be robbing niggas?

Dropped down to my knees beneath the stars and started praying

Look me in my eyes, I'm not here for your entertainment
Do you follow?
I ain't here as your role model
That pill is way too big to swallow
I hollowed out my path
Borrow all my sorrow but don't expect me to take it back

[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
I been dripping candy paint, grew up Willow Avenue
Turned a right on Yellowstone, you see what them players do
So I chuck the deuce who make us home to Herschelwood
And shout out to my cousin Mo, he got off a prison sentence
Lock him in a penitentiary, he ain't takin' niggas with him
Or his daughter either, so send the lord to keep her
'Cause the police killin' fathers, man, it hard to keep 'em
And that's what's in my blood, besides the oil and reefer
I'm in the black slab, tryna catch the reaper
It's a four inside my cup, I crack the seal and fill it
It's a hole inside me, I try to pour and fill it
But in the bottom, another monster, there's somethin' with it
I'm still that little nigga with the little twisties
Waitin' for the bus, and I just missed it
That's why I'm still hungry, why you robbin' niggas?
That's why I dream bigger, fuck a couple dollars
I want a hundred million, and one for all my niggas
And twenty for my mama, she need some bigger ceilings

Second fiddle to weirdos, you feel like Eddie Winslow

Did you win if your purpose is just perfect potеntial?
Did you live up to it, is you just doin' the minimum?
Used to get fifty views, now they need Peggy's momentum (Yeah)
Let's check the addendum
Switch the code, I'm speakin' prophecies like That's So Raven
Bald-headed with lil status, I feel like Maven
But I be dressed like Raven, up in the studio slavin'
Wonder how Peggy be— (Wait, wait)
Wonder how Peggy be cakin'? I be Easy Bakin'
My oven stay prepped and ready for the heat to take it
Niggas that took this road and failed ain't have proper placement
Some of you niggas don't look well, does Peggy make you hate him?
Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? (Huh?)
Or when my homies bring my name up is it breedin' spite?
It's all talent, perfectly balanced, young Supreme Kai
Who am I? Wake up every morning like it's do or die

Hangin' from a chandelier in Babylon
We don't believe in white gods, they gettin' rattled on
Been in the belly of the kingdom, you can't tag along
Unless you got war on the mind, to get the shackles off
You can't ignore the karma when it's flames across your lawn
We checkin' corners, so make sure our lanes don't come across
See, word from Marvin, couldn't sue me from ""What's Goin' On""
Movin' through the system, sprintin' through a marathon
We don't get second chance
And they don't need a reason now, so I don't let 'em plan
When I been fighting for the truth, I bring some extra hands
Cement inside my gloves to knock this shit into the fan
Put that on everything I love
It's been a minute, had to flip
It's in my blood to be a stack
Had to handle other business
Ain't no riddles, it's a fact
If you see me and my energy ain't really tryna chat
That's them generations chargin' the battery in my back
See, I'm fueled by the culture, driven by my ancestors
Body just a vessel, brain tapped into the answers
Tried to see me on the CCTV, couldn't scan 'em
Like the serial was scratched off on the barrel of the branding
I been ten toes down with the city on my shoulders
You got no idea how that weight could make you colder

Ooh, la, la, ooh, la, la

But I'm not the type to say how I might feel

Then dropped out of college, always been a hard-head
Lacking in knowledge
But goddamn, man, when will this end?
I need new friends
And maybe it's okay to fall in love again

I got dirty money, minutes on my tracfone
I just bought a scale, now e'rywhere a traphouse
I got on TV, then I turned into an asshole
'Cause I ain't selling dope or running with them bad folk
I'm eating shrimp and lobster, sitting next to white folk
Now I'm in Trader Joes with Birkenstock and iPhone
My agent called said they want me in the movies now
They used to call me ugly, turned 'em into groupies now
Now I'm on Melrose, I'm ready for my closeup
They call me pretty, need to put me on the poster
I write my name, then I buy a Testarossa
I kill my haters then I leave 'em for the vultures

God-damn, man, I think I need a therapist
Feel like a goldfish in the bowl with
Twenty other goldfish with the bowl switched
Bowl-cut or the mullet 'til I shaved it
Barely made it but I'm still here on my kickstand
Did the same shit that duffed Whitney Houston
They was boostin' while I'm slurping from my sippy cup (sippy cup)
Need blue jeans, pulling out the pocket fluff (the pocket fluff)
Talking to myself like I am my best friend (hello, hello, hello)
When I walk, see the arrogance flushing (hello, hello, hello)
Make the front page like Paris in the sex tape (oh)
Barely late to my first date with my therapist

[Verse 4 (box set only): Joba]
Brrr! Call me, I'll be running in my, Asics
Gold plated belt buckle 'round my, sweat'ns
Tube socks, white tee, Polo underpants
I will never grow old, call me Peter Pan
Dial *67, when they need to listen
I move just like a phantom, I should have been a teacher
Handing out these lessons, my pupils ask no questions
They like to think they're special, I feed them graham crackers
Got my Timex in the mail, keep it in the case
They tapping lines every day, I cannot be traced
I don't believe in credit, my people call me different
I evade, then get paid, brr! Just a second
[Verse 4 (video only): Merlyn Wood]
Trusty press, wear the colors of the ocean
Skeetin' sad in my Supreme clothing
Hit my line if you ever need an OZ
Don't hit my line if you think you know the old me
Have gassed-ass plans in the e-class
And I'm still getting head on public transit
And I'm still really sad about my last chick
And I'm still 'bout to cry outta both heads

[Chorus: Kevin Abstract]
I'm an old soul, tell by my tracfone
Check my credit score, shit was lookin' hella low

Anywhere I go, boys wanna follow

I wish it didn't end like this
You stopped lovin' me a long time ago, didn't notice
Pardon the waves, couldn't contain how I feel about it
Easy to say I'm to blame, no other way around it
How you say you don't love me like you used to?
Solitude is becoming so unusual
Old news that you rush into everything
That's why I'm stuck here tellin' you, you

Say less, rain check, we friends, I guess
I got regrets, hop in Lexus
You don't hear me, but I bought your earrings (What?)
From the PJ's, treat you like an heiress
I ain't trickin', but I got it for your hair and nails (What?)
I always treat 'em too good, and it always fails (I'm winnin')
You an angel, I'm the one that tripped and fell (I’m chillin’)
Can't let go, I missed my own fairytale (I did it)

[Verse 3: Baird]
I'm out my head, I'm in my notebook, I'm feelin' hopeful
I joined The Band in Dylan's tour bus, turn up my vocals
Still makin' faces at your GoPro, like, ""Fuck the promo""
I'll do the live show for a one-horse town
The blue-black behind my eyelids of an unheard sound
The words cracked into a silence of a sun gone down
But no regrets, coyote, baby, you can watch me howl
We're just so different, you and I, I guess we both know now
I guess we both know now

Wish I knew what it meant when I said I loved you (I love you)
Rips in the threads of the net I fell through (Ah)
What I gotta do for you?
Bet my life, paid the price
Almost died, shit was tight (For real)
What a life to lose
Beautiful and tragic, it rang true
Pleasure and pain, both remain (They do)
I was amazed in the maze with you
Said what I meant, meant what I said too
If you only knew...

I know my sweat like cologne; see, this house ain't like home
If I could swallow my pride, would you admit when you wrong?
I know it's easy to just skip it, flippin' out, and you gone
Maybe I wouldn't be so testy when you came for my glow
Got dinner on the kitchen table, make sure everyone know
I made my Sunday mornings feel like Friday nights
I feel like Boobie Miles under these Friday lights
Ready to pounce on any pussy-ass bitch come for my life (Pussy ass bitch)
I'm tired of validation
I'm tired of wonderin' what the fuck I gotta do to save you
You been in this shit for years, I can't be your savior
Had a speech with Satan; on my knees, I'm prayin'
Everything I say breakin' into—

I stay runnin' from somethin' I can't see
True colors blinding, fuck away from me
Gunnin' for somethin' I don't need
I lead two lives, find me
Who's to blame? Who's to say I leave?
Forced to change, forced to face my seed
Break a bit, breakin' in, timely
Good on my own, but I been feelin' alone
I gotta go, don't ask why
Watch the dominoes and the time fly
Either way, it goes, scribble out of line
Get the picture? Different from when I met you

[Verse 1: Dom McLennon]
My mama said I didn’t come into this world with tears
Instead, I welcomed her with open eyes and open ears
Became the glue to a few things that couldn’t be repaired
We saw our future in each other, blending hope and fear
Some things you don’t get to decide, it’s just a fate you share
I used to try to hold the weight that she would need to bear
Watched uncles going on vacation for a couple years
When thеy came back they needed clothеs and had no souvenirs
I pick up the phone, they’re calling us from correction
But nothing is wrong, it’s filling my heart with questions
My mama is home, I’m following her expressions
A drop in her tone, some things that she had to mention
I nodded, I listened, she had all of my attention
""When you on your own, there gonna be some directions
I need you to follow and never make an exception""
I nodded; she held me and wished I would be protected

[Chorus: Joba, Zuri Marley & Christian Alexander]
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see
It's hard to be with you
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
On my sucker-free shit since I was a fetus
Pullin’ up at the doc in a Mazda 626
Bet my dad was trippin’ bad, hit the gas like car-chase
Light blue in the back, mama gettin' labor pains
Dropped my sister at the Bulls' like house was twenty-three
Sweat dripping down my face like river runnin’ free
Dark morning with the fog pourin’ in and out the trees
Every movement through they eyes seem to zoom at lightspeed
Before me, she lost one, stillborn tragedy
Grittin’ the teeth down to the root, pain like a cavity
Holdin' hands like they glued, radio channel on news
Valentines with a ""X"" up on the calendar
They knew I would be a fuckin’ baller like them posters on the wall
A little stain could be the beauty in it all
Amidst all the trouble, most your luck was rubbin’ off
Stickin’ to you like moss—you my Kate, you my rock
Forever

[Chorus: Joba, Zuri Marley & Christian Alexander]
You always used to tell me
I can be anything I wanna be
But it's hard to see

Dressed in the same shit I wore yesterday
Yeah, it's still fresh, never flexed clichés
I never write a verse and repeat the same thing
'Cause the sheen on my chains is my calling to fame
Made in the projects, slave to my progress
I only fuck a black girl if she wearing contacts
You ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts
She hit me on my MySpace she ever wanna find me
I'm way too fly to drive, too drunk to call a cab
But I still need a ride to fit a couple girls inside
Oh what am I to do? I rent an Uber for the week
It's just another whip on my back, and we don't pay no tax
'Cause where I come from, ain't no body getting shot by the IRS
The trap ain't free, better realize that
But I'ma get money, no tests on the desk
Fuck the SATs, smoking Sunday's best
Find me in the ground, only time I regress
Six feet down, no I'm not there yet
Won't you meet me in the grave? I got grass on deck
So a grave like a slaveship, candy colored spaceship
Space like a white girl but ride like a Lexus
Leather with an accent, designed by Italians
But he ain't got medallions, so maybe he a Mexican
But really what's the difference?
[Verse 2: Merlyn Wood]
I don't know difference
Mirror black and white like a pilgrim
Plymouth landed on me like a kickflip
Y'all repress this, oppress this
Question next is why my mentions so menstrual?
I be going ham on Ray Street eating tofu
Loiter at the Whole Foods, sipping kombucha
Yeah, I went green but the black'll still do ya
Damn, she used to be my number one, past tense

Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war
In the daylight, I could say out loud

Turn around and let the wrong house lead a war

Oh, try to keep your cool
You got a grip, baby
But you just can't seem to fall
You know what we are
Took for granted, fell, we catch ourselves
Don't worry, baby girl
There's no one in the world
But when you say I got a girl
Say it and I know it's killin' you, yeah
When I say you make my knees so weak
Then you know I'm missin' you

Yeah, you know it's alright

Send me to California

Not turnin' up to a 9 to 5
Just wanna know why
[Verse 2: Matt Champion]
No plate on a white Lexus
I blacked out on a random cliff
Summer nights, I saw things change
And you still not right to my tick
Pleasure, something
Deep inside my chest
Long nights, long drives
Change across my face
Cowboy, ride it
That's my wild west
Come on babe, you can put it on us
Come on babe, you can put it on me

Baby child
Lift your head and free your mind
Open up your eyes, and you'll find you will fly
Just smile sometime
Welcome to the real world

[Verse 1: Joba]
Everybody pray for peace when they don't have the power
A disconnect of intellect
Know some people packing straps, you could call 'em cowards
The realest Gs I ever met
Not on the gangster shit, not on the paper shit
Just on that have to provide for my kids and shit
There's blood on the streets
And if I had a dream, I would do anything, I make mistakes
The shit that you hear about ain't just in movies
Dog, I've seen some shit
Bag 'em up in body bags, zip 'em up and send 'em
Away from the kids
I know good felons, good drug dealers, good people
Bad system, bad people
With power
If you gotta dream and you know what that means
You can do anything, just make a change
[Verse 2: Kevin Abstract]
Sometimes I think back to the ninth-grade campus
When that white boy made fun of my lips
I should've thrown a tantrum
But I remained cool 'cause he was way too handsome
Now I'm out in Beverly Hills using a mansion as my canvas
I bought a helicopter, threw that bitch on stage
RCA gave us money, we ain't throw it away
We took that shit, we flipped that shit
We made this company pop
They like me, I want 'em to love me like them niggas love Pac
I'm De La Soul meets Tribe Called Quest meets Oasis inside a G-Unit vest
I moved way out to the Westside
But still got the South in my heart
They murdered Selena, now them niggas looking for God
Dressed like a soldier, told ya, they don't know who we are
My vest is on, let 'em know we ready for war
In the club with my boyfriend
We paranoid 'cause, we might get popped
'Cause a nigga on some bullshit
Why you wanna hate me now or ask the skies to lay me down?
I hear my brother praying now, I really need an angel now
Some type of holy savior
Ayo, Dad, I need me a favor, could you pick me up later, later, later?

[Verse 3: Dom McLennon]
I've been exploring through the Joyful
The Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries
Historians romanticize notorious victories
The visions say the scorpion was born as a centipede
That partnered with the succulents to poison their enemies
I tap in time like telegrams with telepathy
To share the bare necessities of all my discrepancies
Can't save my Macbook pages spillin' onto the melody
'Cause the margins 'round the pen
Couldn't keep up with my head again, uh
I kept that devil in my sights to never fall behind
That's how we always stay ahead, the flaw of my design
The higher that you climb, the more destructive your decline
I’m well aware that all this didn’t have to quantify
So tell me if you really think it's unrealistic
Here at this point for me to not prepare and arm our district
They shouting, ""Hands up,"" while they deploying their ballistics
We shouting, ""Hands up,"" and kids who need it go ballistic
The difference in our League of Extraordinary Minorities
Against the identity, representing authority
Move between 'em accordingly, and clutch my rosaries
Before they try and send the lord for me, that's more for me
That's when the forerunners told me: ""This is not your speed!""
While they repeated their beliefs from the Apostle's Creed
The most consistency I found in life has never come from people
Still looking for an equal, nobody will believe you
[Verse 4: Ameer Vann]
God ain't give me a penny, I made a million dollars
I got a thug for a father so I took care of my mother
God threw me in fire, I walked out with my brothers
You know the Shadow of Death?
I was born in the valley, but now I live in The Valley
God gave me a house, God gave me depression
God gave us life, but we ain't know it was cursed
I was hurt as a child, you know I still deal with it
Now I'm a grown-ass man with immature-ass feelings
All I wanted was money, just to get it and spend it
On strippers and weed, I ain't skip on the liquor
I can't talk to my niggas 'cause if I say it, it's real, and I ain't ready to face it
I've been flirtin' with Satan
I've been flirtin' with women that like to dance when they naked
And I throw all of my dollars, I throw all of my problems
To the back of my throat with weed smoke and klonopin
I'm ashamed of myself
About three days ago, I planned on killing myself
But I'm still here breathin', you know I'm still here screamin'
Screamin', ""Fuck that shit,"" we signed for fifteen million
And I almost missed it, I know that y'all niggas hear me

[Outro: bearface]
We found a light
Will you still carry me?
When I fall
Let the hope and the joy
Rain down on me
Rain down on me (Ooh)
Raise me up
Carry, carry, carry me17Embed"

Take they money and they keys
