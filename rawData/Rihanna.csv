I can just hear them now
""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)
(I know there’s too much at stake)
(Making the same mistakes)
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
(Stop while it’s not too late)
And I still don’t know
[Verse 2]
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

[Chorus 1]
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I don’t care I’m in love
(Stop before it’s too late)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how do I know that it's right?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s not too late)

[Bridge]
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
[Chorus 2]
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
I finally know what it's like
(Stop before it's too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
In a new direction
(But you make the same old mistakes)
So how will I know I've gone too far?
(You don’t have what it takes)
(Stop before it’s too late)
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
Feel like a brand new person
(But you make the same old mistakes)
And I know it's hard to describe
(Stop thinking you're the only option, oh)
(But you make the same old mistakes)

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry

I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction (Shh)
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts

Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and

And parties at Richie is getting risky

Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, ""Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,""
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt

They'll never understand

To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation

But you put on quite a show (Ooh, oh)
Really had me going
Now it's time to go (Ooh, oh)

I'd rather be smoking weed whenever we breathe
Every time you kiss me
Don't say that you miss me
Just come get me

Don't know why, just know I want to
Don't know why, just know I want you

[Verse 2]
I'd rather be breaking things, cause we can't see
We're too busy kissing
Just making scenes, here come the police
They know about your history
How you live and love like ""fuck rules""?
Don't care why, just know I love you

Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

[Chorus]
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

[Verse 2]
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

I don't wanna do this anymore

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer

I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with

It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow

In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low

[Verse]
I ask you, ""What's the matter?""
You say ""Oh, it's nothing at all.""
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars

Put it in your face, but you actin' all scared
Like you can't recognize a good thing
Now that you got a chance, tell me, what it's gon' be?

Don't you let it go

Take a breath, take it deep
""Calm yourself,"" he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go

[Chorus]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (Trigger, trigger, trigger)

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, ""Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps""
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost

Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

As my life flashes before my eyes
I’m wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won’t get the chance to say goodbye
But it’s too late to think of the value of my life

Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no

We heading to the top, if you coming, come on
I’m flying out to Pisa, just to get some pizza
Fly down to Jamaica, just to roll some reefer

No pain is forever, yup! You know this (Young!)
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' needa try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this (Young!)
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades (Shades)
Blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion
As in, going 'til they say stop (Hold up)
And my runway never looked so clear
But the hottest bitch in heels right here (Here)
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on
I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal
I better let you know

All up on it, know you wanna clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony (Young!)
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top getting lonely (Young!)
Who think they test me now?
Run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from twenty-seven million (Young!)
And I want it all
It's gonna take more than that, hope that ain't all you got
I need it all (Hold up!)
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that
All on me like that, yeah

It's go hard or go home, back to your residence
Soon the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em ""Give me back my swag,"" they tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames
Louis belt, what that make me, Louis Mane?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be to 'em

Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Verse 2]
My new nickname is ""You Idiot"" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, ""Let go, he is not the one""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You're telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why
[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Stupid in love)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Bridge]
Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

[Chorus]
This is stupid (No, no), I'm not stupid (No, no, no)
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid (Like I'm stupid)
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

Take it to the tele and make her a victim

He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

So much, I can't resist falling into your arms

You have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think is my business
But, you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses

Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?

Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But, just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But, it's so hard to live
Just wonderin' if you're givin'

You'd rather make up a lie
Then make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then, what do you think you did?

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinkin' of everything that we've become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh

Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said, boy

Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah

Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses (Kisses) and my lovin' (And my lovin')
But ain't nobody better than us, yeah, yeah

But you and I know it's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey

I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
(When we ride, we ride, it's 'til the day that we die)
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say

On my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough

[Bridge]
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?

[Chorus]
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
[Verse 2]
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see (No)
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough

[Bridge]
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love

We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along

We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime

And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines

I will write to tell you what's goin' on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know
[Pre-Chorus]
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life (Oh)
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road

So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you (Miss you, miss you, miss you)
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here

Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah

I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I'm not spending any time, wasting tonight on you
I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
So I won't be changing too, you know
[Pre-Chorus 2: Rihanna]
I don't believe, I don't believe it
You left in peace, left me in pieces
Too hard to breathe, I'm on my knees right now, oh

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love

[Bridge: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love (hey!)
I'm so sick of that, so sick of that love

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm so sick of that same old love, that shit, it tears me up
I’m so sick of that same old love, my body's had enough
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
I’m so sick of that same old love, feels like I've blown apart
I’m so sick of that same old love, the kind that breaks your heart
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love
Oh-oh-oh, that same old love3Embed"

On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie

[Verse 2]
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh

[Bridge]
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories

[Chorus]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie2Embed"

Feels so good being bad (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
There's no way I'm turning back (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Now the pain is my pleasure 'cause nothing could measure
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Love is great, love is fine (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Out the box, outta line (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
(Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Hey, you know they say pain is pleasure
Turn it up when you play this shit
One time for my latest girl
You can be one of my greatest hits
Tired of rapping ’bout chains and whips
Do you like to get chained and whipped?
Do you like rough sex? Hit 'em like I’m upset
Do they get your panties wet?
Le-le-let's go, you rockin' with Cole, it's the best flow
Put the game on lock while those lame-os watch
I'm on fire, they are not, I kick down the door, they all knock
Bitch, I’m a boss, they on a clock
You used to be a good girl, don’t matter
Since you gone bad, you only got badder
[Chorus: Rihanna]
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, ""Ah-ah-ah""
I like it, like it

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? (Yes)
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

[Verse 2]
Take off my cool (Take off my cool)
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause (Round of applause)
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose (Want me to lose)
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? (No)
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is
[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing

[Spoken]
Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh (Haha), I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am

[Chorus]
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
