[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Damn, life's so short
Fuck it, I don't wanna go to court (Huh!)
Fuck it, got a budget for the lawyer, though
Fuck it, I'm on the run for the month (Woo!)
I'm in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil' niggas thuggin', even got me paranoid (Huh!)
I'm gettin' money, that's in any nigga category
Double M, I got Gs out in California (Huh!)

Stay schemin' (Yeah), niggas tryna get at me, dawg
(Young Frankie Geechi Liberace, yeah)
I ride for my niggas
[Verse 2: Drake & Rick Ross]
It bothers me when the gods get to actin' like the broads
Guess every team doesn't come complete with niggas like ours
That's why I see no need to compete with niggas like y'all
I just ask that when you see me you speak up, nigga, that's all
Don't be duckin' like you never wanted nothin'
It's feelin' like rap changed, it was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaghetti bolognese in the Polo Lounge
Me and my G from D.C., that's how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some shit like that? You never know
Million-dollar meetings in a Polo Lounge
Me and my man Oliver North, that's how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets 'bout a rap nigga
I tell that bitch it's more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe 'bout to lose a hundred fifty Ms
Kobe my nigga, I hate it had to be him
Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym
(Huh! Bitch, you wasn't with me shootin' in the gym)
Tell Lucian I said ""fuck it,"" I'm tearin' holes in my budget
Bag her like we in Publix, and take her ass out in public
Ordered her the filet, told 'em, ""Butterfly it, she'll love it.""
She used to soda and nuggets, she really just out here thuggin'
I'm just hittin' my pinnacle, you and pussy identical
You like the fuckin' finish line; we can't wait to run into you
But let me get my mind off that
Young rich motherfucker gettin' mine off rap, with my niggas (Huh!)
[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas (Maybach Music)
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg
I ride for my niggas

[Verse 3: French Montana]
From the hoopty coupe to that Ghost, dawg (Huh)
Pigeons on the roof like Ghost Dog (Huh)
Dwight Howard on the post, dawg (Huh)
My niggas got the powder through the post, dawg (Huh)
Watch the body tilt when you hit the head (Huh)
Niggas lost mills tryna beat the feds (Huh)
Ten grams off my last 250 now (Huh)
Big-ass crib, 250 down, damn!
Gave my nigga Max 7-5 (Huh)
Then gave my nigga Penthouse another 30 (Huh)
Fuck it, got me thinkin' like I'm 7-5 (Huh)
Damn, nigga ain't even seen 30

[Chorus: Rick Ross & French Montana]
Huh, I ride for my niggas, dawg
I ride for my niggas (Maybach Music)
I slide for my niggas, dawg (Dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin', niggas tryna get at me, dawg

Diced pineapple
Tonight you shall reach a height that the sky won't catch you
The highest form of my admiration
I ain't no connoisseur but I'm, kinda sure you will admire my taste
And before the sun graze ya, I'm tryin to see how deep you are
And believe me shorty I ain't talking 'bout no intimate conversation
I wanna see if I can make you reach things unobtainable
When I peek into your nature
And I promise you my goals will exceed any physical pleasure
I wanna, give you what's better than better
The better my effort, the wetter her treasure
The more these mere moments seem like heavens or, temporary forevers
Shorty get it together, hah, diced pineapple
May your love come down so my mind might have you
You designed my imagination
Let me redefine foreplay 'til you need five and
Tell me shorty you got it baby
If it's not it baby, hope it's progress baby
Let it all drip baby
If you stop that shaking, no more talking baby
No more talking baby

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, damn, my baby tastes the best
I nearly lost my mind, guess it was a test
Swept her off her feet and went and bought her ass a Lex
Paid it off cash so I never wrote a check
Leave my cars at her crib, I'm just stuntin' on her ex
Pussy's excellent and I know it sound a mess
I love to make her toes curl as I'm lickin' on her flesh (ugh)
Sex all night, couple shots of CÎROC
Crib on the water, got LeBron up the block
Money ain't the thing, baby, welcome to the mob
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
Bitch so bad got me wishing I could sing
Her uniform Isabel Marant when you on the team
Double MG, them other niggas fell off
Baby girl, I just wanna see you well off
[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Shorty so fine, pussy so fresh
Diced pineapples, I just bought my girl a set
I know my lifestyle wild, I do it for the set
She know how to make me smile and she do it with the sex
Pop bottles, make love, Thug Passion
Red bottoms, Moncler, high fashion
Belt buckles, door handles, gold plated
Balmain, rich denim, out in Vegas
French Riviera, baby girl lets take a trip
I'ma trip go to Cannes, France to catch a flick
Baby listen, this position is a blessing
And with your permission, hopefully you'll learn a lesson (ugh)
I'm so fly that I shouldn't even walk
She so fine she ain't even gotta talk
Diced pineapples, talking diamonds by the jar
She never wrote a song but I know that she's a star
[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment
When you say it cause you mad then you take it all back
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right
Then we fuck all night 'til things get right, aww yeah

[Verse 3: Wale]
Something about her, probably can't live without her
Roll up some sour, let me kiss on her fountain
Mission accomplished, you increasing your heart rate
And I won't ever rest, we meet at the peak of your mountain
Eager to show you, thinking that I should know you
And you eager to work perfect, I can employ you
Designer shit spoil you, rub you down with the oil
To get on a higher tree, gonna have to climb a sequoia
Hol' up, showing off some Agent Provocateur
Rushing you out your drawers though patiently get you off
Hate when they be too anxious though, hate when they be too dull
Like to go deep but I hate to get too deeply involved
How sweet is you? (sweet is you?) Let me see some proof
Fuck making pussy talk, I like to make it sing a tune
All we need is we, we don’t need no room
Right now I’m trying to eat, and we don’t need a spoon
[Chorus: Drake]
Call me crazy, shit at least you’re calling
Feels better when you let it out, don't it girl?
Know it's easy to get caught up in the moment

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Four stacks for the heels on my bitch feet
Car seats still smelling like 10 ki's
Tell the plug that I'm lookin' for an increase
Wingstop, fat boy need a 10 piece
Say a nigga name and the car start
Nigga switching lane to lane like Wal-Mart
Sippin' Bordeaux out in Bordeaux
Hazard lights flashing on the four-door
Switch the Benzo for the Enzo
Back to the Benzo when the ends low
Switch my old bitch for my new bitch
Cause my new bitch something like a nympho
Fuck the game raw when I came in it
Getting money ever since I came in it
You couldn't stop me if you tried
Motherfucker cause the devil is a lie

Big guns and big whips
Rich nigga talkin' big shit

Talkin' half a milli' for the weekend
Contract like a nigga play defense
Curtains in the Maybach bitch peek in
Now the bitches wanna car hop
6 cribs for the cars in the car lot
Dope boys on the goal nigga
Went gold 6 times for a gold digger
Black bottle and a bad bitch

That's D'usse baby welcome to the dark side
Coulda got blacklist for the crack shit

Now I'm black Jesus turn water to wine
And all I had to do was turn the stove up

The devil try to hit me with the RICO, them black people
Devil want these niggas hate they own kind
Gotta be Illuminati if a nigga shine
Oh we can't be a nigga if a nigga rich?
Oh we gotta be the devil that's some nigga shit

Brooklyn on the Barney's like we own the bitch
Give the money to the hood, now we all win
Got that Barney's floor lookin' like a VIM

There's a field with angels movin' around me
I just worship thee, for all he's done for me
It's a new day, I have been born again
I've been born again, I've been born again
In His spirit, and His name, I'm sanctified!
Lord I testify, he's right by my side
I believe it be, His word is so clear to me
Yeah, yeah

All I want's a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it done turn me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby, they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Plus that paper chasin', it had turned me to a savage
Groupies in the lobby they just tryna get established
God, I've been guilty, fornicatin' from my status

[Verse 1: Kanye West & (Rick Ross)]
Niggas be lovin' the old Ye
They sayin' the new Ye, that nigga be spazzin'
But when Ali turn up and be Ali
You can't ever change that nigga back to Cassius
So you can gon' and make up lies, but I'm so sanctified
I don't sweat it, wipe my forehead with a handkerchief
And wash my sins in the blood of Jesus (Hunt)
H!eople sayin', ""Ye we need another Yeezus"" (Hunt)
H!ames try to tell me, ""Cut the wildin' out, out""
But who the fuck is you reachin'?
Pass me 30 bottles, champagne procession
That's that Holy water, sanctified refreshments
God sent me a message, said I'm too aggressive
Really!? Me!? Too aggressive!?

Keys to my success, I get new keys and new address
Bitches that I date don't get degrees but they can dress

Major cult figure, I'm the fresh David Koresh
Soldiers all in gators, new Mercedes for cadets
Balmain uniform, you know Donda designed the vest
Double M, that be the Army, better yet, the Navy
Baby seen me in that Wraith, wanna have my baby
All I wanted was a hundred million dollars and a bad bitch
Now I want two hundred and ménage in my palace
Walkin' out the jeweler with no mothafuckin' balance
Somewhere in Jamaica I'm still holdin' on my chalice
Rims on my Ferrari, my bitch said that I was childish
'Til I fuck a girl, that girl tweeted that I was stylish
When we fucked again, she told me ""That was just some foul shit""

It's where ever you wanna go!

Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't let it go
Whether that's right I will never know
Uh, but here goes nothing

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
When I'm alone in my room sometime I stare at the wall
Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?
My down bitch, one who live by the code
Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl who swallow what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space
Elroy Jetson: I'm somewhere out in space
In my 2-seater she's the one that I would take, wee

Mr. KFC, VVS's in the watch
Living fast where it's all about that money bag
Never front, you take it there, it ain't no coming back
Top down right here is where she wanna be
As my goals unfold right in front of me
Every time we fuck her soul take a hold of me
Addicted like Pookie that pussy be controlling me
That thing keep calling
Fuck maintain boy: I gotta keep ballin!
Pink bottles keep coming
James Bond coupe pop clutch 100

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

She got a thing for Chanel vintage that dropped before she could speak English
Do you love me or love seekin' attention, I mean which one is it?
You keep callin' me ya twin, but twins ain't this different
Mentally I'm already on next year, that's some 20/20 clear vision
You sayin' let you finish, I ain't tryna hear it
I'm all for spiritual liftin', but I don't fly Spirit
I'm all for findin' happiness, but down to die serious
All smiles, Kevin Durant trials
Had to blow it on the court, I must have blew a milli'
I'm walkin' on all charges, that's my new Achilles
I know they love to rock a check, but who gon' do it really? Really?
My depositions never surface
Tanenbaum know the logo on the jersey, it's gettin' purchased
Ten years in and y'all yet to hear my most impressive verses
Paid the cost to be the boss wasn't even my most expensive purchase
Trust when I say I'm never on the shit they assumin' I'm on
Tales about me are like corridos in Culiacán
Sashimi from Saito, you know that man two Michelin Star
Postcard from Grace Bay, sendin' my distant regards
Vision wasn't mine, told my niggas the vision was ours
Still a part of shorty even if we've been livin' apart
Roxx'll do you filthy for me soon as I give him the nod
Meanin' he'll blast for me like puttin' the 6 with the God
Hop on a float to show the city the one they appointed
The one that's rebuildin' schools and feedin' the homeless
Hang with my niggas, but sometimes I be tryna avoid it
'Cause they'll get to poppin' out of place like they double jointed

""I gotta get the most of everything"" is the axis on which it sit and twirls
Point blank period, like a City Girl and then I bring it back to 50 world

But I understand, they'll never understand me

Love makin' love, but where will love land me?
Jealous, so their bitches be actin' like they sleepin' on us
But they speakin' on us, jewelers quote us even numbers
Still blowin' smoke as angels float above us
Love givin' back, but will they ever love us?
Chanel in the mail, FedEx from Pharrell
And what I got for sale just sit on the scale
Triple beam dream, a buck on the shades
I really seen things give mothers the shakes
I really bought cars for women on face
I know it seem odd, but money amazin'
College loans really did fuck up her credit
Discover cards, look back, I know she regret it
But we keep pushin', keep our foot on the pedal
In the mirror she a blessin', rebukin' the devil
Livin' on the edge, she keepin' me level
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever
Money come and go, I'ma keep you forever (Forever)
Slip-on glass slippers and tickle with feathers
Everywhere we go, we create a dilemma
Coming to America, really the set
I'll let your soul glow, I'm keepin' you wet
All my cold Decembers, I know she remembers
Forgiveness for a sinner, but is it that simple?
Holdin' on your hands, your body's a temple
Fly you out to Cannes, ménages with bitches
Lobsters and the prawns, thought you was Spanish
Bottles for the Don, our parties the biggest (Biggest, biggest)
(Maybach Music)
[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Had a dream she was singin' to me like Gladys Knight
True love in the projects is called paradise
All your niggas left, you wasn't actin' right
But honesty itself a small sacrifice
My money bag heavy, got me packin' light
You movin' funny, can you fill my appetite?
Niggas' conversations, a lot of it false
He own condos right over Carnegie Hall
Speak about your cars, but all of 'em parked
Your niggas' money light, come out of the dark
You really are my type, that's not a facade
One of the reasons why I write, we got a synopsis
I'm always at the top of barbershop gossip
After further thought, better not knock 'em
Allocate some dollars to go out shoppin'
Bitch, we on the real, it's time to stop talkin' (Stop talkin', stop talkin')
[Chorus: Drake]
Ayy, woah
You made me this way, yeah
Before I'm gone outta this place, yeah
Put some flowers in my vase, won't you?
Let me know that I did okay, yeah
Don't wait 'til some other day, no, no
They love to wait 'til it's too late, too late (Ayy)13Embed"

If Michael Jackson came alive right now
He'd ask you to smoke one for him
So in his honor

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
You niggas Spud Webb, coming up short
Think you're Dee Brown, jump if you want
I put it on my momma and her very last nerve
Ricky Madoff everything I deserve
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
The square root of a kilo is me nigga
Do the math, I'm a motherfucking G nigga
[Verse 2: Gunplay]
It's all on me now, as you can see now
I'm gon' get this money and I will not be denied
Been shittin' on you fucks a long time, time to pee now
When you finish first they hate you worse, startin to see now
I'm at the round table, where your seat at?
Where your plate, where your lobster, where your sea bass?
We ain't never left, acting like we back
You should see us now taking pictures acting like we rap
This the circle that'll murk you, blackout, short circuit
Somebody show them square ass niggas the first exit
This here reserved for soldiers most definitely
So watch what you say and where you step more carefully
If I fall in the field and ain't no more air for me
Pour some on the ground and put one in the air for me
Tell my enemies fuck 'em, they know already but fuck 'em
Tell 'em again with a middle finger and a chuckle
You don't know nann nigga, nope, uh uh
This famous that'll still throw copper
Cross so heavy crack the tabernacle
Fire the ganja back up
Throw some blow in my tobacco
Then crank the Lac up
One match left, this the last turn
Santeria candles in my sanctuary burn
I'mma earn 'til the last court adjourn
'Til the last gavel drop we gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
We gon' have it locked
[Verse 3: Stalley]
I'm part of the small percentage of niggas who make it out the ghetto
But niggas tried to pull me back cause misery loves company
It's funny how they come for me when they see me living comfortably
But when I was broke and sleeping on floors they ain't want nothing from me
My future's so bright but my past so ugly
And I just try to correct it all but it all still haunts me
Tried to section off the past but it still haunts me
So I accept what got me here, reflecting in this rocking chair
All this space created, all that hard work it got me here
So what I look like telling a nigga that I shouldn't be here
Power to the people so the people shouldn't live in fear
And I'll be that raising voice and tell the people treat us fair
Warring in the streets tell them soldiers to meet us there
Out in the open all alone, I felt the coldest air
Secluded in my thoughts in fear
No one to talk to, no one there
Not even a voice, not even an ear
No one alive, no one to care
Now I got a power circle, now I'm on a power trip
And they calling me counterfeit cause I ain't gave a coward shit
Stone me, throw me a pile of shit but you won't pull me out of it
It's funny how it comes full circle
Now they wanna be a part of the power circle
They wanna be a part of the power circle
[Bridge: Wale]
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine
May the wind be at your back
May the bad be in your past
May the kids take all your good
And your wife have class
And you realize your goals
And what's life without grind
Those niggas, yo' niggas?
Hope those niggas real as mine

[Verse 4: Wale]
There's a difference between underrated and hasn't made it
Once you successful they relentlessly giving you hatred
There's no applause for ya and success is hard for ya
There's enemies, envy, with green my niggas -- lawnmower
And I'm on tour, Jordan 4's, Tom Ford
And I ain't thugging, they clapping at me, a encore
Got a dark heart, bright mind, make women crazy
I give her D, I throw up two, I call that shit a safety
Shit is crazy when entertainment ain't entertaining
And my inner sanctum need real estate I'm out my cabeza
Jealousy's for the weak, you ain't happy I made it
I be feeling like brother Malcolm just out of the Nation
Allah got us cause if we hollered a lost numbers
I seen hustlers turn cluckers out niggas grandmothers
So shut the fuck up and listen, fuck all them stuck up musicians
My circle small but regardless, my circumference official
My clothes different like quarterbacks at a closed scrimmage
They gon' blitz us but ain't no way that they gon' hit us
I'm so elusive, so my niggas be goin' through it
Guess it's a wrap when your co-defendant make soul music
Cash rule the world -- at least it do with girls
At least it do with churches, seek the truth and true it hurts
If they real, then they real -- my niggas deserve it
And we don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
We don't deal with weak squares in this power circle
[Verse 5: Meek Mill]
I'm like welcome to the power circle
I came a long way, I started with a powdered circle
Clique full of real niggas that'll probably murk you
Cause they about that murder game you do a lot of verbal
Lotta talking, lotta Tweeting, 'til you hear that chopper speaking
Kill my dog, I kill your dog, we tied even, I'd believe it
If you see it then you got it, nigga never give up
Cause if you grindin' you gon' be rich before you can look up
My cousin Knock told me never teach niggas to cook up
Cause you can sell 'em hard for the low and give 'em the hookup
And still make the profit
The streets say I'm the hottest and a nigga still modest
I'm just being honest
Back to the wall, never let 'em get behind us
Mac in my draws fitting right in my designers
Look at my persona, I dreamed it, woke up and conquered
And there was commas after commas, I eat 'em like Benihanas
Put the shrimp over the pasta, the pasta over the lobster
And the lobster over the table, power circle a mafia
Just talkin' money, talkin' money what you talkin' bout?
Probably talkin' bout us, we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about
Cause we the only thing to talk about

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside the eyes of the last Mohicans survived
You won't last a weekend outside
Seen a pastor tweaking, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
Later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
See a demon don't compromise
And so I walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
I'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
I might as well put all my killers in YSL
Put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggas through hell
Hell's fire, I never lie, you will never grind
I know the priors they running by us when we do crime
I know that section eight wanna discontinue my Moms
When they heard that Ohio State gave me 30 racks in July
Oh Lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
When they day breaks and you earned them stripes
And you learned that strike
From upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
It's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
Now your fate can record it denied a reporter replied
The death rate will eventually climb, so eventually I'm
On a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
So about face if it ain't business, I get offended, I mind
Now one fake, I'm a realist in strive, I'm a billion in five
Well a billion cause the limit is the sky and I live on cloud nine
And I recognize my nemesis gon' try to put a finish in my shine
But pussy, we'll hurt you
Life in the power circle

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Regardless of how it goes down
Life goes on, am I right?
Tried to warn you niggas
I tried to warn you niggas
It's too late now
Double M-G
Too much cake
Too much power
Too much respect
Bow down, nigga
Ugh!27Embed"

You can't handle this, nigga, you can't handle, sit down in the corner, shut the fuck up and take notes, bitch. Just take notes

I used to see niggas on TV, man
I used to be like, ""Yo, them niggas so blessed""
You know what I'm sayin'?
If I had that opportunity, you know what I'm sayin'?

(Black Metaphor)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Damn, I grew up on that Cash Money
Bling bling, was well known to flash money
Hit the liquor store, after my Vic authority
Quick to switch a bitch up, pick up me a thicker shorty
Pistol on me, nigga, ain't no pickin' on me
We veterans so it's better if you go get your army
A thug holiday is where your body lay
Me and Trick Daddy come from a common place
So us gettin' money, that's just a conversation
It's so hard stayin' rich and miss the confrontations
Cigars in the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan
Hug Barack Obama, whisper, ""As-salāmu ʿalaykum""
Live for the moment, die for the streets
Bible on the dash, kilos on the seat
I used to see you niggas on my TV screen
And wondered what was life like, was it all a dream?
And then I met you out on LiveNation dates
Came to the realization that your watch was fake
Damn... you nearly broke my heart
I really thought you niggas really owned them cars
[Interlude: Rick Ross]
I used to look up to you, nigga
Ugh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Hard to point a finger when you live a life of sin
I'ma bring my niggas with me if I lose or win
Bought a fleet of cars, let the bitches tag along
This little thing of ours, not the ones to tattle on
Omerta the code, Met Ball, parties with Vogue
Still blowin' thick smoke while you powder your nose
Such a head rush until the day the feds rush
That's when you niggas wish you put your bread up
Leased whips, bad blood, that shit'll sink ships
Fast money comin' slow, you better think quick
Rap game, so much fuck shit done
That's why this .45 in my Trukfit trunks
Fuck a skateboard, I went and got a Wraith, boy
Catholic record labels, niggas gettin' raped, boy
Birdman's a priest, moans in his synagogue
Publishin' is a sin, repent, forgive me, Lord
Shots fired, home invasion out on Palm Isle
Red beam detonators, who the bomb now?
Look you in your eyes, nigga, 'fore I say good night
And pray that Mannie Fresh'll get to see the light
[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Damn, Stunna
I loved you, nigga
Hate it came to this
(Maybach Music)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
You stole them boys' pub' and bought a foreclosure
Scott Storch demons in it, which is more poison
I handed over records, never charged a coin
But could sense the sentiment, I'm talkin' all along
All Miami issues, Rozay handle for him
Same way Big Ducky do for me in California
Never slippin', got relationships with the trillest niggas
Tony Draper, J Prince and even Jimmy Henchmen
Plenty killers and I know that Diddy with it
Tyga, chinchilla, really ain't no penny pinchin'
Knew that you would never visit BG
Turk came home, take that boy a three piece
Shootin' dope, usin' coke, movin' like you the Folks
Sacrificin' half our life for your new music cult
You would give us self esteem and motivate our drive
But was in our pockets by the time we count to five
I pray you find the kindness in your heart for Wayne
His entire life, he gave you what there was to gain
I watched this whole debacle so I'm part to blame
Last request, can all producers please get paid?
[Outro: Rick Ross]
Can't believe this shit, homie
I still love you, nigga
How the fuck, nigga, you touch half a billion, nigga
And your team starvin', nigga?
You on an island, nigga, you came to my city, nigga
I let you in my city, nigga
And what hurt me the most, nigga
Is how you did my brother Khaled, nigga
Khaled was loyal to you, nigga
The pain I seen in my brother's eye, nigga
FaceTimin' my nigga, nigga, he took that to the chin, nigga
That's why my nigga blessed!
That's why my nigga Khaled blessed!
You put my nigga in the hole, homie
I don't feel you for that, my nigga
That shit hurt me, you under-dig? Umm
It's painful what you see real niggas do
When they get the paper, when they get the bag
You can't never forget 'bout lil bruh and them

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
It's funny because, it's been on my mind lately
Having a dope beat, a dope idea
Sixteen bars ain't enough!
How the fuck, can I squeeze my whole life into a sixteen-bar verse?
You know, so many different levels, to living your life and
Depicting, with your wordplay
Exactly what life means to you, and sixteen ain't enough
I know y'all gonna feel me on this one
You gotta feel me on this one, huh!
[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
It's funny how things change, funny how time fly
More than my feet travel, the more that I feel fly
More that I make now, the more that the chicks smile
She call me a local nigga, I opened a Swiss account
Eisenhower status, Etta James on the dash
Smooth as John Coltrane cruising in the Cadillac
Seville, feel my life on the real
We the Last Poets so this is a world premiere
Rolling like Mick Jagger, the women just getting badder
All I see is the money, cream, Eric Clapton
And all I wanted was one, sixteen ain't enough
Talking that fast money, fifteen every month
When your people labelled poor, that motivated me more
Everything I ever wore was once worn before
Roll with the punches now it's box office numbers
Dressed like Sammy Davis, steaming my marijuana
Double M G's, double M fees
We in every hood, nigga: government cheese
Yacht to Yachtmasters, Ol' Dirty Bastard
Floor seat for the Heat, paper that I'm stackin
Better put away a penny for the rainy days
Pick and roll, give and go, fuck a fade away
Living like Scottie Pippen, dribble riddles for vittles
Started off with a scribble, now I'm flowing a river
She say my heart cold, I'm naming my son December
Whitney died night before the Grammys – damn, what a memory
Trump Tower and I started with a 10 speed
Born broke, had to use a nigga's instincts
Now I get a hundred racks for the sixteen
Waking up to turkey bacon and my thick queen
Niggas hating, I'm just watching on the big screen
Three Stacks on the beat and the kicks mean

You know how sometimes you got so much to say but
They on-, they only give you sixteen? Hehehe
Man it's like, I mean, I got so much to say
The world has said so much to me
And I just wanna give right back to 'em
But, I only get sixteen, that's like a cage, you know?
I really can't say what I wanna say, you know?
It's just a glimpse, that's all
Just one uh, one little single glimpse, just a page
But I guess I'm defeating the purpose of doing all this talking
Aight

[Verse 2: André 3000]
Summer '88, or was it '89?
Or was it wintertime? Aw never mind
I'm in my room, booming
Drawin' LL Cool J album covers with Crayolas on construction paper
I'm tryna fuck my neighbor, I'm tryna hook my waves up
I'm tryna pull my grades up, to get them saddle lace ups
Before lil' Marc was Jacob, before them girls wore makeup
Before my voice would break up, before we'd tour them shake clubs
Before my mama wake up, before my crumbs would cake up
Before they tell me they love me and we'll never break up
Before the time she makes love to someone that I thought was my homeboy
But boy, was I wrong now
I don't budge, don't want much, just a roof and a porch
And a Porsche, and a horse and unfortunately but of course
An assortment of torches that scorches the skin
When they enter, intruders whose tutors did
A lousy job, how's he God if he lets Lucifer let loose on us?
That noose on us won't loosen up but loose enough to juice us up
Make us think we do so much and do it big
Like they don't let us win, I can't pretend
But I do admit, it feel good when the hood pseudo-celebrate
Hence, why every time we dine we eat until our belly aches
Then go grab the finest wine and drink it
Like we know which grape and which region it came from
As if we can name 'em; hint-hint—it ain't, um, Welch's
Hell just fell three thousand more degrees cooler
Y'all can't measure my worth
But when you try, you'll need a ruler made by all the Greek gods
Because the odds have always been stacked against me when back's against the wall
I feel right at home, y'all sitting right at home
All Kellygreen with envy while I'm jelly beans descending
Into the palm of a child, looks up at mama and smile
With such a devilish grin, like ""Where the hell have you been?""
She's yelling, ""Selling’s a sin,"" well, so is telling young men
That selling is a sin if you don’t offer new ways to win
A dolphin gon' shake his fin, regardless if he gets in
Or out of water, most important thing for him is to swim
And Flipper didn’t hold his nose, so why shall I hold my tongue?
I miss the days of old when one could hold his gal on his arm
And not set off these alarms, when camera’s snap-snap-snap
Return fire, pap-pap-pap pap pap-pap pap pap
They’ll learn why, mere privacy, so essential
They won't make no laws, I break their laws 'til they see out our window
I take the fall to make them all treat human kind more gentle
Forsake them all, I hate them all, don’t like em, don’t pretend to
Yeah something tells me, we ain’t in Kansas anymore
All that shit that used to be cool ain’t cool anymore
All the women we were pursuing, now they want more
And they deserve it all, don’t settle for what ain’t yours
[Hook: André 3000 & Rick Ross]

Breakdown, breakdown

[Breakdown: André 3000 & Rick Ross]
Does your mama know you see me? Does she know you're freaky?
Does she ever wonder if it's 'bout ya I am speaking?
Do you ever ponder where I'm at when you get sleepy?
How the hell I'm gonna tell the youth don't be me? Yeah
Hahahahah, hahahah, I love it
Does your daddy think you perfect? Does he know for certain?
Does he know how you act when you pull back all them curtains?
Do he think I'm 2Pac 'cause I'm Black and put the words in?
Does he know his daughter might have caught a real merman? Yeah

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Hahahah, it's funny because, we could've short-changed you (Huh!)
But because we love you, we go that extra mile
Break it down for 'em, André, huh!

I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'ma put it on you baby, take you past the sky

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Uh, wake up in the world and I'm just another nigga
Call it public housin' when you next door to the killers
On them corners, it gets better as you go
Grind that motherfucker 'til it's yellow brick road
Free as a bird, spoken word in my verse
On my knees prayin', niggas shootin' in the church
Wake up out my sleep in another cold sweat
I lived on Billboard, where the fuck to go next?
Go against the odds youngin', go and get a job
Another country boy they want back on the farm
So far from my goals but I'm close to my kids
Thug cry for Mac Dre, nigga throwin' up Thizz

[Hook: Betty Idol]
I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'ma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, well let me light one for my problems
Smokin' on that loud, pumpin' up that volume
Get it crackin' like an eggshell in this motherfucker, make omelets
Get a bad bitch that posts up like comments
They don't know what I been through
Don't know what I'm goin' through
As long as I get through, that's what I look forward to
Richer than a bitch, but still I can't afford to
Let these niggas play with me, need to be remorseful
I swear I got that silencer on that MAC-9
Yeah, I kill these niggas with silence
My head stay in the clouds, I really feel like a giant
Can't trust none of these niggas, I murk one of these niggas
Then bury one of these niggas, still got dirt under my fingers
That, ain't a threat, that's a bet
Cause they comin' at my neck like the best a man can get
But to make a long, story short, I need a shoulder
Cause the devil on one, the other one I'm lookin' over
Tunechi

[Hook: Betty Idol]
I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down
I just wanna, I just wanna fly, I'ma show you tonight
That I'ma put it on you baby, take you past the sky
I just wanna burn
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Uh, I pray I live forever
Niggas hatin' like it's Salt Lake City
No tints on that pretty ass Bentley
Want you to know that them comments don't offend me
Cause your baby momma so friendly
I proceed with the plan, weed in my hand
Cîroc in my cup, quick pic for a fan
Money over bitches, first nigga with a Wraith
Double M, we handle business cause them niggas getting raped
Go get the yellow tape, it's well orchestrated
200 acres estates, a young nigga made it
Came from the hood, ain't nothing changed
Still lemon pepper on my motherfuckin' wings!

[Hook: Betty Idol]
I just wanna be the one, I just wanna be the one you love
I just wanna be the one you run to when you're down

I just wanna burn

[Outro: Rick Ross]
Huh! Mastermind
As I get high in the middle of the night
Sometimes I ask myself, do thugs cry?
Uhh, uhh, Mastermind, my 6th LP
Can't believe we did it

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
She's just perfect in every kinda way
But I don't think I can handle her pain
So messed up and I'm too busy just runnin' my game
Oh, girl after girl, mistake after mistake

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
I've tried to change, but they always around pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises (boom)
Broken condoms, lipstick marks and unprotected sex (uh)
I feel like shit, you know I ain't shit
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock
Baby, I took advantage 'cause I knew you
Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We at the crib, she got her legs wrapped around my waist
Conversation, she lick every tattoo that's on my face
Like a thug, I just wanna fuck, that's every day
Temporary separations, confessin' my mistakes
She packed her bags and left me home and I'm still hurt
You new pussy, but she can't tell me that it's real first
A lot of lies apologized, the thirst real
When she hear this thinkin' to herself, ""Damn this verse real""
Rehab out in Vegas, that made this a murdered sin
Sent the bottles to her table, then made love on the jet
Temporary thrills, all these women you think I tossed
My feelings genuine, disregard what you see on blogs
I been a boss before I recorded Meek song
Mill in cash on the 'gram, they trendin' Meech home
In the D and my G, he throwin' that P-Stone
Every picture that you post, we comments on each one
[Verse 3: Chris Brown  & Rick Ross]
I'm just a typical ordinary nigga
But I know that I can't change the rules
All this time I blamed you 'cause I know what I'm doing
Stepping on your heart again, relationship ruined
I tried to change, but I'm always out, fuckin' around in the club (May-May)
Pieces of my love letter tore up from this break up (uh)
My worst nightmare went right in my back, I wish I could wake up (uh)
I feel like shit, know I ain't shit, but I'm... (May-May-May)
[Chorus: Chris Brown & Rick Ross]
Sorry, won't turn back the clock

Wouldn't believe it, so I used you
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry don't make it right, I know (gotta love it, baby, uh) (May-May-May)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Life's short and baby girl, you deserve a winner
Every day the diamonds on you get bigger and bigger
Hustle from my heart, so every night I can deliver (uh)
Sayin', ""Sorry"", layin' up, I'm way up in your liver (boss)
The red bottoms got you walkin' funny (ha)
Get you an agent, she ballin' and all she talk is money (right)
Take her shoppin', baby boy, ain't no salary caps (uh)
She get it poppin', so you better bring battery packs (huh)
Perfect time to relax
Nothing is perfect other than me and the perfect match
They all watch me 'cause the moves I make out they budgets
Diamond district, six figures on my shorty nugget

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
I've tried to change, but they always around, pullin' me down in bed (May-May-May)
Gave you my word, but they were just broken promises

This shit is highly sophisticated
I just make it look easy, nigga
Follow me

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm so sophisticated
To get a verse from me, you gotta be initiated
To get a purse from me, she gotta be sophisticated
Purchase a whip from me and never miss a single payment
I'm from the city where the Muslims even Christians hate it
Even the black folk hate to see another nigga made it
Tell all them pussies to chill, champagne refrigerated
Just bought a chopper 'cause the last one, got it confiscated
Counting a hundred mil so many times, I contemplate it
You wanna be the hottest but that shit get complicated
I pull your card, I know you're pussy by your conversation
Show you the safe, you'll have to kill me for that combination
Made another two milli just off the compilation
I just hit a lick, I'm telling you this shit amazing
Got a white bitch, she fucking me just like she Jamaican
Sipping purple and that motherfucker concentrated
This for my niggas in them prisons, overpopulated

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment
We going hard, run it back just like it's Walter Payton
The game sweet, gave all my niggas an occupation (Rugh!)
We so sophisticated (Ugh!)
Shit so sophisticated (Woo!)
Hundred millionaires, bitch we made it (Ugh!)
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm so sophisticated
Smoking weed, busting open Dom and liquor later
I bust her open then I tell her I'ma lick her later
Pull out the stick and spray that bitch just like it’s activator
Time to lay down these niggas who still be masquerading
We know you pussies, so you got my niggas masturbating
Round of applause 'cause them choppers be so captivating
So sophisticated ‘cause them hits be calculated
Put yo dick in the dirt, now you decapitated
I'm getting money so you'll never hear me talking petty
Tatted on my stomach, rich forever, Makaveli (Babyyy)
Fifty million, hundred million, it's accumulating
I'm the hottest and these other niggas cooling, ain't it
I got a bitch I'm fucking that you see on BET
My Lil' Haiti shooters will have yo ass on TMZ
Breaking news and we still get them for ten a key
And if he faking, fuck him, tell them niggas ""C'est la vie""

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Shitting on these haters, ball hard D Waiters
Ever since I got money, e'rybody need favors
That's why I ain't got no homies, and I ain't got no neighbors
But I be on my grind like I ain't got no paper
But I'm so rich and I got yo bitch
All in my whip and she all on my dick
With a hand on my stick, tryna live in my crib
'Cause I handle my shit like a candle got lit
'Cause I burn shit down, yeah I'm in my bag
And these niggas so mad it's my turn now
And I get that cash and my bitch so bad, she so sophisticated
I'm balling hard, fucking bitches and ain't got shit for haters
I hang my arm out the window now watch me get the paper
My neck so frosty, you frauding, yo shit refrigerator
Boy you an imitator
You ain’t got no M's in yo account, I never ask my amount
Treat that bad bitch like a bad check 'cause I cash that and I bounce
I ain't never had shit but I grab shit and I cashed out on that ounce
And I flipped that to a bird and bounced back like word

This the mob so you gotta get initiated
If you a mark, then you gotta make initial payment

Geah
Classic hip hop shit
Dr. D-R-E
Rozay and Jay
Let's get 'em!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
We started out mopping floors
And now we front row at the awards
Number one for the last twenty years
If you real, mothafucka scream cheers!
Mothafucka scream cheers!
Heh, and it is what it is
He wanted to shine at the swap meet
Till the white boys got him in that hot seat
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones
Money long, number one twenty years strong
Fuck a gym, I am him, Andre Young
G5s to 6-4s, Dre got 'em
If the bitch bad, I got her in red bottoms
Great weed, nice homes, bread proper
Tec nine, one chamber, top shotta
Bentley coupe, new yacht, my helicopter
Born broke, real nigga, straight outta Compton
The fuck you magazine niggas want from me?
I rewrote the game, nigga, now talk money
All-black, on my Al Capone shit
I built a house, nigga, get your own shit
I only love it when her hair long
You should listen to this beat through my headphones
[Interlude: Rick Ross]
See y'all niggas
Hit the switches on that shit one time
Ugh
Let the top down

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I came a long way from the weed game
Twenty stack seats at the Heat game (Woo!)
And I'm still strapped with the heat man (Ugh!)
Can't be steppin' on a nigga feet man (Hah!)
80 pair of sneakers came from the D game
Cousin was a Crip, said it was a C thing
Brown bag money in a duffle bag
Fuck 'em all, wet 'em, then we gotta double back
The homie whippin' chickens in his momma kitchen
On the mission, said he get it for his son tuition (Ugh!)
Real nigga's dreams comin' to fruition
Stumble, but I never fall, leanin' on my pistol (Woo!)
I only love it when her ass fat
We should listen to this track in my Maybach (Maybach Music)
I'm just tryin' to be a billionaire
Come and suck a dick for a millionaire (Ugh!)

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Ugh
It's just different
I know it feels different
Ugh
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I only love her if her eyes brown
Play this shit while you play around with my crown
King H-O, y'all should know by now
But if you don't know, ugh
Millions on the wall in all my rooms
Niggas couldn't fuck with my daughter's room
Niggas couldn't walk in my daughter's socks
Banksy, bitches, Basquiat
I ran through that buck fifty Live Nation fronted me
They workin' on another deal, they talkin' two-hundred-fifty!
I'm holdin' out for three
Two-seventy-five and I just might agree
Ex-D-boy, used to park my Beamer
Now look at me, I can park in my own arena
I only love her if her weave new
I'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do?
Been hoppin' out the BM with your BM
Taking her places that you can't go with your per diem
Screamin' ""Carpe diem!"" until I'm a dead poet
Robin Williams shit, I deserve a Golden Globe, bitch!
I'll take a Ace in the meanwhile
You ain't gotta keep this, Khaled, it's just a freestyle
Fuck rap money, I've made more off grapes
Fuck show money, I spent that on drapes
Close the curtains, fuckboy, out my face
I whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case
Murder was the case that they gave me
I killed the Hermès store, somebody save me
Stuntin' to the max like, wavy!
Oh, shit!
Oh, stuntin' to the max, I'm so wavy
Used to shop at TJ Maxx back in '83
I don't even know if it was open then
I ain't know Oprah then
Had the XL 80 bike, loud motor, they be like, ""Damn!""
When I'm comin' through, rrraaanngg
Had the grill in '88, y'all niggas is late
You got all that, right?
Ugh! I love this shit like my own daughter

I build it ground-up, you bought it renovated
Talkin' plenty capers, nothing's been authenticated
Funny, you claimin' the same bitch that I'm penetrating

You wanted to fuckin' walk around these roaches. These niggas is roaches. These niggas is mere motherfuckin' mortals. I'm tryna push you to supreme bein'. You don't wanna motherfuckin'... You don't wanna embrace your destiny, you wanna get by
You don't wanna go into the motherfuckin' dark where it's lonely. You can't handle the motherfuckin', the pain of the motherfuckin' not knowin' when the shit is gonna stop

Momma's tryna save me but she don't know I'm tryna save her
Man, them niggas tried to play me, man, 'til I got this paper
You're nobody 'til somebody kills you

""Blast for me"" – the last words from my nigga
On the pavement, born killers, body shivers
Drug money, dollar figures
Hustlers movin' out of rentals, art of war is mental
Havin' sushi down in Nobu
Strapped like an Afghan soldier, nowhere to go to
So it's bang, no survivors
Only riders on my rider, murder rate rises
Stalkin' niggas on their IG's, never; I be
Still solo, Under Armour still Polo
No wire, on fire
My desire for fine things made me a liar, a shooter
Gettin' high feelin' like it's vodou
Nine lives, SK with the cooler
Makaveli in the 'Rari, still B-I double G, I, E
I pray you smoke with me
Go to bed with a kilo like Casino
Janet Reno, we all we got the creed of Nino
Pretty cars in the driveway
If you cut it then you sideways, double up, crime pays

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm from where the streets test you
Niggas mix business and pleasure where the cocaine measure
The narcotics is our product
The by-product, you walk up on me, I cock it
New Mercedes as it peels off
Nothin' penetrates the steel doors, gang signs, see 'em all
I said my prayer as I'm countin' sheep
Never really athletic, but I play for keeps, do you feel me?
The mortician, the morgue fillin' with more snitches
We kill 'em and takin' their bitches, R.I.P
Chinchillas on a winter night
Black bottles when I'm feelin' like, you wanna know what winners like
And I'm never on that tour bus
Just a decoy for niggas, the PJ's for two of us
Ciroc boys down to die for Diddy
My niggas ride for less, keep it real, homie, made me filthy
Touch mine, until it's even: kill
Like I'm knowin' every heathen will, closed the deal with Steven Hill
We Magic City of the networks
Cut a nigga cast off, how my nigga net worths

(M-M-Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Tears runnin' down a nigga face
In a room full of failures, I feel out of place
Still sleepin' on the floor when you deserve better
Got you reekin' through the cold even in warm weather
I told Meek, ""I wouldn't trust Nicki
Instead of beefin' with your dog, you just give 'em some distance""
We all make mistakes, let's not be too specific
We like, ""I rather be a killer than be a statistic""
I never fold, no, I never ran
On my soul, I'll roll like an avalanche
I thank the Lord I got some great friends
That's why every bottle I open, I say, ""Amen""
Just had seizure at the Super Bowl
Woke up in the third quarter lookin' for the smoke
If it's more than a quarter million, I'll count it twice
Pucci broke my heart, shit, I call it life
And never will I call it right
Not perfect but I'm the one you would call at night
Travelin' the world, I'm just reppin' my city
But rarely do I hear that this nigga done did it
When niggas in fatigues will keep you intrigued
'Cause the loss of life's the only thing niggas believe
So I pray you listen carefully
Then I become another motherfuckin' casualty
[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
You even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
You do it for the love of you and I (for the love of you and)

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Standin' on your block but you so out of place
Uncle on the couch, momma runnin' out of space
Lights off so you never tend to speak much
Go your separate ways every time the lease up
A fat ugly nigga, thought I'd never be nothin'
Another tree stump, happy with his free lunch
Duckin' pigeons, I'm an eagle on a sunny day
Flap my wings once a week, pray I glide safe
I want fried chicken at my funeral
Rolls Royces, dope boys, Sway interviews
Everybody dyin' for the same things
Cop kill a nigga, don't nobody gangbang
I'm happy Donald Trump became the president
Because we gotta destroy, before we elevate
Real shit, look at me inside the white house
With a pocket full of weed inside the white house
Dead presidents tattooed on a nigga chest
U.S. treasury addressing me, mad at my address
Own the biggest residential pool in the U.S
Drake and Kanye can invite every bitch they ever met
Finger fuckin' bitches in the holy water
Then I go an tell what happened to my only daughter
So her daddy told it to her firsthand
Never perfect but it's not just 'bout them purses
[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq]
Always speak and say hi
You just never ever walk on by (never ever walk on by)
You even stopped and put one in the sky (the sky)
You do it for the love of you and I (for the love of you and)

[Verse 3: Raphael Saadiq]
The streets could never teach me
All the things I got from you
I found myself in the wrong lane
And I ended up in pain, pain
I was strolling down a dark street
When this girl passed me by
She said you've always been a good friend (always been a good friend)
And you never never never let me down
I'll just fall back, never turn back
Let it go, let it go
I'll just fall back, never turn back
Let it go, let it go

These hoes won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back

[Verse 1]
I look in my fridge, my shit lookin' scarce
I got a few kids, we need some shit on the shelf
I get a knock at the door, they say my rent overdue
And while my niggas sell dope and don't know what else to do
The only thing on my mind, I'm tryin' to keep on the lights
I call up my slime, I need a kilo tonight
Everything went well, I'm eatin' steak, no more soup
Then I parked the Caprice, I went and got me a coupe
Everything takes time, but this shit came fast
Niggas standin' in line, they wanna hold me back
I multiplied my hustle, stimulated my mind
Motivated my niggas and we'll never divide, NO!
[Chorus 2]
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back, no

[Verse 2]
First I got me a Taurus, then I copped me a Lexus
I took over Florida, my connect out of Texas
Then I start sippin' purple, got my shit screwed
When you feedin' your circle, watch your shipments improve
Fabricate 'bout your fortune, all my fabric's imported
Fornicate in my fortress, 40k still my mortgage
24k my toilet, all my taxes reported
All my exes deported, shout-out Texas, New Orleans
All these niggas influenced by a hustler's endurance
I just bought me the purest, but I need some insurance
Niggas watch who you fuckin' just to hate on your bitches
Niggas breakin' the rules, niggas facin' suspension

[Chorus 2]
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back
These hoes wanna hold me back, no
[Verse 3]
Momma workin' three jobs 'til I told her to quit
How we rose from the sewers, funny now I'm the shit
Niggas ain't gettin' money, but they got an opinion
Had this tech makin' racket, serve you like you were tennis
Killers ride for that paycheck, AK, okay, check
Bitch nigga let's play chess, yo bitch next, no latex
These niggas won't hold me back, told the feds they sold me sack
Whip 'em right and then come right back
Whip-whip-whip 'em right and then come right back

[Chorus 2]
These niggas won't hold me back
These niggas won't hold me back

This is for the soldiers that see the sun at midnight
You dig?
Let me slow down
It’s so Inkredible

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I go to the grave before I be a bitch nigga
Better behave, you dealing with some rich niggas
We the lost symbols, speak in cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand the codes these hackers can’t crack
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole (No)
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I’m iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal (Woo)
Ugh, it’s just the intro
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free Mason (What), freelancer (Yeah)
Free agents (Me), we faster (Ha)
Big contracts, big contractors
Built pyramids, period, we masters
No caterpillars, it was just a lot of niggas
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All-white mansion, I’m the child of God
All-black diamonds, times were hard (Woo)
New Rolls Royce, guess you made it, nigga (Ha)
All-white neighborhood, you they favorite nigga (Nigga)
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK (Ayy)
So— So I ""JFK""
Join forces with the kings and we ate all day (Oh)
Right now, I could rewrite history (Woo)
I stopped writing, so fuck it, I’ll do it mentally

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Niggas couldn’t do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
I'd have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don’t know who to trust
Whole world want my demise—turn the music up
Hear me clearly: If y’all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairytales
Go to Hell, this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass, y’all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It’s amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red-hot
I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet—keep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov, just say you love it

If I ever die
Never let it be said I didn’t win
Never, never say
Never say, ""Legend didn’t go in"" (I'ma go in)
I just wanna die on top of the world
Making love to my favorite girl
I'm making beautiful music, we making a movie
We knew we was born to do it

""Oh, I'm gonna walk in the moonlight with you.""
""You wanna hold my hand?""

I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves, so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell
From a hundred black Bibles, while we send them all to hell
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)
I need a hundred black coffins, black coffins, black coffins (Oh, Lord!)
Black coffins! (I need a hundred...)

[Verse 1]
I seen a hundred niggas die
I put that on my life, Lord, I wouldn't tell a lie
Unless it had to do with mine, in the middle of the night
Killers coming for you life, all you wanna do is shine?
I broke off the chains only the realest remain
I see your praying to Jesus, but will that help ease the pain?
Seen a brother get slain for a jar full of change
Yet I post on the block, look like I'm Big Daddy Cane
Is you a cat or a mouse? Keep them rats out the house
A lotta scars on my back, get tattoes all around
Hundred dead bitches, hundred black coffins
Money on his head, bitch, I'm trying to make a fortune

I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves, so I can lay they ass in
I need a hundred black preachers, with a black sermon to tell

[Verse 2]
I seen a hundred women burn
As they stood firm, treat a nigga like a germ
What did she do to deserve? Put me on the farm
Pigs' feet in a jar; serve it to me warm
Any questions, they hang 'em, better pray for Dj-Django
Got me working in fields, too many years it gets fatal
All I want is my woman, such a wonderful mother, (mama!)
On the days that it rains, her smile bright like a summer
Our revenge is the sweetest, bitch cause I'm coming
Gonna die in my arms, for what you did to my mother (my mama!)
Hundred dead bitches, (Lord) hundred black coffins (why?)
12 gauge, shotgun, chest full of carbon (boom-boom)

I need a hundred black coffins for a hundred bad men
A hundred black graves, so I can lay they ass in

Want to conversate and steal game from us

Riding five deep and I'm as dirty as them congressmen
Sixty-two, without no tint; missing roof on my new shit
Ironic since my drive increased, my driver see the profit
Yeah, work, fuck you niggas, pay me though
Smoke that Mark McGwire strong, Oakland A no basic smoke
Shout-out to your lady, a.k.a. MMG favorite ho
Tell that ass the way to go, before I show her where to go
No Canseco, and I'm switching lanes at one-six-oh
A nigga tree fire, a police siren, woop woop, nah, that's just Diplo
And you cute, shorty let's get low, on a note, I'ma talk that jazz
Jungle fever for the night, horny and white, that's Anglo-Sax

Fuck em, fuck em, I'm screaming ""Fuck em""
Fuck em, fuck em, I'm screaming ""Fuck em""
Fuck all you haters, watch me fuck all these bitches

I'm screaming ""Fuck em, fuck em"", I'm screaming ""Fuck em""
Fuck em, fuck em, I'm screaming ""Fuck em""

Kilo in the kitchen, pussy niggas Merry Christmas
Bitches taking pictures cause we keep on getting richer
Say a nigga name you know you fucking with them killers
Walking through the club only salute the real niggas
Ain't no bottles on your table, pussy boy go get your gwolla
Hoes don’t credit pussy so you can’t pay her tomorrow
Bitch just bought a house she can't afford to run her mouth
I run all these fields, I run the game, not just the South
Bow down to the biggest, Belaire I be spilling
Counting all this paper, no games with these pussy niggas

Fuck it, I ain't even counting the money no more
If it ain't right, it ain't right
It ain't even matter no more
Cut me up a lil' bit
This next-level shit

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Two-door Bugatti coupe, I call it ""Katy Perry""
Wiz Khalifa papers, smoking my favorite berries
S65, I call it ""Rihanna""
It got a red top, but it's white like Madonna
Made man—you hear what I said?
Having a slumber party, all my bitches counting bread
Made man, also known as ""Papi Chulo"" (Ugh)
And I’m running straight up in the culo
My wrist always on frío, call me ""Chilly Chill"" (Ugh)
Super head from Superhead, and I really will
Californication, motivation in my pocket
Got on my blue Dickie, shout out my nigga Roccett
Still smoking sticky, it ain't no other option—
Not for made niggas, and I’m never stopping
I raised the bar, I set the standards (Ugh)
My yayo Usher Raymond, that bitch just keep on dancing
[Chorus: Rick Ross & Drake]
Dollar bills on top of dollar bills
Thats all I’m throwing—if she won't, lil' mama will (Ugh)
Made niggas, talking a lot of skrill
Eight digits, a nigga tryna live
Made man (Ugh)—you hear what I said?
I got a hundred squares—if you scared, call the feds
Made man, I’m screaming, ""Dollar bills""
Pop the trunk on the Porsche (Ugh)—there they go, dollar bills

[Verse 2: Drake]
Riding 'round the city, plastic cup of Henny
Find a nigga like me? Truth be told, I don’t know many
I say shout my driver, Lauren; that '62 with curtains
Can't see shit, I don’t know where the fuck I’m at for certain, ah!
When it boils down, I’m just a T-O nigga
But bitches tell me that I look just like a Creole nigga
New Orleans know it’s love every time I’m in town
Shout out my nigga, Tez—that's my brother, my 'round
Spending tomorrows money, I call it ""Mañana""
Off the rack just ain't my style, I call it ""designer""
One of my baddest women ever, I call her ""Rihanna""
But that's 'cause her name is Rihanna
I’m in the condo just posted, watching Miami kill
I might just walk to the arena and watch it for real
Ashes to ashes, me, Rozay and Khaled
Smoking bullriders, shit moving slow as a ballad
Tattoo on your ass—it’d be nice if you show me
I’m buying bitches furs: Mike Tyson, Naomie
I’ve got the right to do it, it’s only right to do it
Love me some head, and I love a woman that likes to do it
Still love my team, ain't no other option—
Not for made niggas, and I’m never stopping
I’m Damon Wayans, just know that homie don’t play that
You know we run it, my nigga, Young Money, Maybach (Maybach Music)

Black Panorama, I call it ""T-Pain""
I got my AutoTune, that bitch insane
Got my revolver, too, I call it ""Ving Rhames""
You still a baby boy, we doing big things
Street niggas—you hear what I said?
I got some bad news: Jabar back in the feds
Facing twenty, he just did a dime
Been out a year, look like he finna ride
Genocide, these people killing time
Throw you in a hole, you must be penalized
Soon as you see success, haters reinvest
Miami guns drive, half a million, nothing less
Raised the bar, I set the standards
My yayo MC Hammer, that bitch just keep on dancing
Michael Jackson: Let it moonwalk
Set it on the napkin, let it cool off

[Intro: Rick Ross]
It's time to take you to the other side
The side you gotta watch your A&E cable television for homie
But we live this shit
I'm not a star, well that's a lie
I seen a man raise his hand on the stand, he testified
Spoke on the homicides, amongst other things
Even shared my triple beam dreams
[Verse 1: Nas]
A project minded individual, criminal tactics
Us black kids born with birth defects, we hyperactive
Mentally sex-crazed, dysfunctional, they describe us
They liars, at the end of the day, we're fuckin' survivors
I remember watchin' Scarface the first time
Look at that big house, that Porsche paid for by crime
How could I sell this poison to my peoples, in my mind?
They dumb and destroy themselves is how I rationalize
In the bastardized nation, Magnum .45 carryin'
Where I'm from ain't far from Washington Heights to cop Aryan
A rookie boy, the cookie didn't make no profit
A stranger to the block, I damn near had to make them cop it
It only took a fiend to taste it once to say it's garbage
I brought it back to papi, ain't tryna take no losses
He focuses on my emotionless young dealer face, then pauses
He gives me powder, he has faith in Nas' ambitions to distribute coke
Had addictions to gold chains, Mercedes Benz hopes, but I'm again broke
This shit ain't cut for me, other dealers, they up their orders
Barely at 62s, they already up to quarters
They out there every day, some true hustlers for you
I'm at it half way, none of my customers are loyal
Picturin' pipin' out the seats of a Pathfinder
Powerful pursuit for pussy, cash, to flash diamonds
My junior high school class, wish I stayed there
Illegal entrepreneur, I got my grades there
Blamin' society, mad, it wasn't made fair
I would be Ivy League if America played fair
Poor excuse, and so I was
Throwin' rocks at the pen, just for the love
Before the evil, the secret life of G's
You seein' me blurry, triple beam dreams
[Hook: Rick Ross]
Pocket full of money, parkin' lot full of them haters
Triple beam dreamin', crib with 2 elevators
20 flat screens and got cameras every angle
Dope been comin' so you know the income major
Rule number 1: I can't do business with a stranger
Contract killers comin' when I feel endangered
Early 90s reminiscin' when I had a pager
Triple beam dreams: now Pat Riley my neighbor

Fuck boy, talkin' out of turn nigga
In the court room, spreadin' like a germ nigga
25 on the line, them niggas droppin' dimes
Cooperation got them rednecks droppin' time
Khaki suits and some niggas go to actin' cute
We was all cool, stackin' in Acura coupes
More accurately, we acted as is if jackin' was cool
Snatchin' niggas out they shoes then wear jackets to school
Fuck boy, you caught up in my dream
Countin' cream on the cover of a magazine
I'm the source, got the plug with the uncut
Jay-Z Blue Magic nigga, what what
Brand new S Class with a meal ticket
Nigga cocaine white as Tommy Hilfiger
Ralph Lauren Blue Label as I'm gettin' high
Triple beam dreamin' as the cream multiples
Fuck boy, talkin' out of turn nigga
'Fore you sell dope, it's shit you gotta learn nigga
Home invasions, duct tape
Fornicatin', countin' money with a fuck face
Fuckin' bitches that be givin' up your whereabouts
Slow leaks, gotta air em out
Kill 'em all, Rolls Royce Ghost nigga, ball
Phantom drop head, shit I had to get em all
Niggas hate but they know they never get involved
Food on the plate, fuck em all, I could send my dog
Triple beam dreams, the ghetto's my reality
I'm from where your hustle determines your salary
Six figure family member, nigga forget about it
Low income housin', nigga tryna get up out it

Nigga livin' in rubble, but then I'm labelled a rebel
Any nigga wan' rumble, somebody hand me a shovel
Gotta silence the lambs, get on my Buffalo Bill
Steppin' off the Sonoma with the black duffle bag filled
Got a cute bitch with me, favor Kimora, for real
Got Meek Mill on the celly (Meek Milli) that nigga worth a few mil
I multiply what I manage, I manage to multiply
Witness real niggas fail, and watch you fuck niggas strive
Witness bitch niggas tell, Jabar just got twenty-five
At this point in my life, I'm just tryna survive
Homicide stay on my mind, Christopher Wallace of my time

Makaveli returns, it's God forgives, and I don't
Resurrection of the real, time to get richer than Trump

Dreams of gettin' cream and never to be extorted
Seen so many things, be preposterous not to record it

Got on my mother pearl, she fuckin' up father time
Babies be havin' babies, I'm talkin' 'bout how I grind
Niggas thinkin' it's voodoo the way bricks be multiplyin'
Affiliated with wealth, associated with death
Self-made millionaire, snatch a triple beam off the shelf

Yeah, I got a feelin' nigga, really that my money be the root
Look up at the stars, she like, ""Honey, where the roof?""
Pull up, hear the dogs, Canaries, they gon' woof
Even once had a job pourin' tar up on a roof
That boy had it hard, no facade, it's the truth
So now when I menage and get massaged it's the proof
Proof's in the pudding and that baking soda cakin'
Paper that I'm makin' got her takin' photos naked
Listenin' to niggas like whistlin' at Wendy Williams
I flip my middle finger, I'm chillin' on twenty million
The rumors turn me on, I'm masturbatin' at the top
These hoes so excited, so they catchin' every drop
I'm dodgin' debacles like potholes in Jamaica
We cut down the weed, bury the paper on the 'maicas
Martin had a dream, Bob got high
I still do both but somehow I got by
Creflo prayed, Mike Vick paid
Bobby Brown straight, Whitney lost weight
Kimbo Slice on the pad when I write
That Mayweather money lookin' funny in the light
But who really cares? We just throw it in the air
Celebratin' wealth, pourin' Moet in her hair
Excuse me, her weave, the bluest of weed
Trunk full of white, car smell like blue cheese
That boy get salad, beef bowel movements
BMWs on them big thangs lookin' foolish
Shawty sitting low, big thangs popping
Tip on the Glock from a Crip up in Compton
Shootin' at the cops, fuck one-time
I gave her to the block, I fucked one time
We Boyz N the Hood, and nigga, you lil' Tre
Suppress ya appetite, we takin' ya lil' tray
Love my handgun, but my choppa still the shit
Banned in 1994, but I'm ""2 Legit 2 Quit""
1996, kilos was the shit
But that was better than roofin', that shit be bad fo' ya skin
Niggas was ruthless, Lord knows that I sin
But I thought about my future and the loops I could pin
Walked out on the gig and I turned to the streets
Kept my name low-key, I ain't heard from in weeks
I came up wit a strategy to come up mathematically
I did it for the city but now everybody mad at me
Motherfuck 'em all, they sweat from my balls
If I drop another album, I did that for my dawgs
Ten Maybachs everybody ridin' big
I just sit back like, ""Look what I did""
Then I bow my head and beg for forgiveness
Once I said my prayer, everybody back to business
Smokin' on a blunt in my own restaurant
People lookin' from a distance think I'm Big Daddy Conch
Reincarnated, spirit of a G
Beef I'll make you thinner, take a seat so we can eat
A Farrakhan aura, pause on the pork
You eat from the bowl, while your dog need a fork
Niggas ain't loyal, snakes slithered in they coil
I'm laughin' at you cuz, kill you niggas when I'm bored (yeah!)
We steppin' on you crew 'til them motherfuckers crush
And makin' sweet love to every women that ya lust
I love to pay ya bills, can't wait to pay ya rent
Curtis Jackson baby mama, I ain't askin' for a cent
Burn the house down nigga, you gotta buy another
Don't forget the gas can, jealous stupid motherfucker
To another chapter, paper that I captured
Caught up in the rapture off gunshots and laughter
Homicide is humor and nigga you lookin' funny
Women love to stare cause they know they see the money
I open up her mind by openin' bank accounts
Deposit a hundred stacks, break-up, won't take it out
Baby that's a gift, maybe you could live
I knew it wouldn't work but, I just like to give
Used to run the street, young nigga bare feet
Now I'm in the suites and I'm eatin' crab meats
Ice so right, other rappers envy
They callin' all my jewelers up, askin what he spendin' (whaaat?)
Thinkin' 'bout Boss, not thinkin' 'bout them
This a letter to my enemies, one I won't send

Mighty Muhammad, son of Osama
Son of a bitch, one time for my momma
Tats on my back, tats on my face
Bitch I'm a don, can you relate?
It's never too late, my niggas, relate
Never would say, my niggas is saints
Know I'm a sinner, God give me my sentence
Labelled a hustler, look at my Benz
One time for Black, nigga, one time for Nut, nigga
One time for Gucci, nigga, one time for Cano, nigga
One time for Bizzle, nigga, these my realest niggas
One time for Trav, nigga, and all them dope dealers

No you didn't see it but I know you bitches heard it
Blood on the corner, damn I miss my dawg
I'm just thinkin' 'bout his daughter, in another life he ballin'
[Verse 2]
Is this a drug dealers dream?
Cause all I ever see is niggas dyin' from disease
Mansion on the water, home in the hills
Let the Fed tell it, it really isn't his
Photograph our endeavors, plottin' potential set-ups
See me as a promotion, tax charges, etcetera
Confiscated the whips, concentratin' on flips
Contemplatin' the trip, congregatin' for bricks
Lord knows I'm a sinner, it was cold in the winter
Eatin' out of the trash, shit would make you a killer
Lord forgive these bitches, gettin' their money strippin'
Chasin' this fast money, next time we'll do it different
Shoutout to KOD, shoutout to Onyx nigga
Shoutout to MMG, cause we the hottest nigga

Aggravated with hoes, distracted all of my foes
Niggas want to be friends, we just takin' control
Nigga vision the clearest, I get shooters on clearance
Barely fit in a Lambo but did it for the appearance
I seen a rich nigga go to jail
He put Wi Fi in his cell
Middle of the night, my nigga wanna Skype
I just count money for him, that shit just get him hype
They say it's hard to smile with a double life
In the middle of the night with a bloody knife
Lord give him a chance, every man should be free
He wanted him a degree but got him a ki
Open that door, just hopin' for more
They gave him a bond, I gave him a Porsche
I gave him a name, I gave him a shot
I gave him the game, I gave him a block
Smokin' on that gas, I be thinkin' too fast
Drug dealer's dream, now let's count this cash
Dope boy tatted on my neck
A real dope boy, I never write a check

And I ain't fuck your girl, she rode, my stick-shift she drove
Did everything that she 'posed

And I was like, ""Got that, drop that, pop that""
Got the top back on the dropback, I'm back

The bank account done caught the holy ghost (Huh)

Things I did in the dark, will it ever see the light?
My nerves should be a wreck, I got a bad chick
She keeps me erect, she loves my ad-libs
I think I'm a genius, hundred grand a fuckin' feature
I do at least three a week, roll up the fuckin' reefer
Went from Benihana to Bimini in Bahamas
Ten chains, no luggage, I'm a big timer
Niggas claim that they thuggin' when they dick-ridin'
My niggas rather walk, do they own brick climbin'
On the block in my all white sneakers

Pray for me cause you know a nigga doin' wrong

Count mills for the times that we had it hard
Askin' for a hundred mill as I pray to God

Now I'm stuntin' on these niggas cause I couldn't back then

And I wear them all at once, I ain't tryna match them
I remember bumpin' Mack 10 and that deuce in the corner
Scrapin' up for a sandwich and a soda
Now my strength is up and I'm danglin' chains off my shoulders
But no Jesus piece on mine, cause at times I feel ashamed
For the reason that I buy em
And they say, because I'm Muslim I shouldn't think about the shine
Or even put it in a rhyme

But for now, I'mma wear these ten chains and floss

Bright lights and dark corners as night embark on us
Refugees runnin' wild, Wyclef with a SIG Sauer
Nothin' to lose, I was starvin' from the start
Now the same cat drivin' Jaguars
Open fire when you see me yell out and make em whisper
The club that I'm a member, they'll be gone by November
Keys to the city got killers who slither with me
Lamborghini, middle of the ghetto, smoke a fat fifty
Billionaire bid, wrists on chill
Standin' in the field of dreams, tryna see a hundred mil
These boys goin' blind they just happy bein' free
In a world of so many I just wanted me a ki'
Sheesh! I just wanted me a piece
Slice of cheesecake before my niggas all deceased
These boys snort lines, I'm fine just sippin' wine
Amsterdam in the air, tomorrow on my mind

I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm livin' through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf

Born in the bricks with the short end of the stick
Always runnin' late, quick to show up with your bitch
The Hublot's cool but my Terminator's foolish
All stainless steel, quick to match it with my tool and
Red carpet event, the marijuana be lit
Red or blue, do you, as long as you're gettin' rich
Crack game, champagne, kilos on the stock exchange
Rolls Royce, new Ghost, that's a nigga pocket change
These niggas actin' like they want a war!
When it come to whackin' niggas I done won awards
Nigga, you a bitch, where yo' Honda Accord?
I'm ridin' in some shit only I can afford
Shouldn't claim the hood til you build a rapport
Amsterdam state of mind: I just gave you a tour
I'm laughin' at the people who label me poor
Now I piss on Europeans, you'd think it was porn

[Hook]
I'm Berry Gordy to the streets
With a kilo, so that boy had been a beast
I wanna be there when each one of my kids born
Royal blood, hundred acres each to live on
Real nigga to the day that I'm deceased
Even then I pray I'm livin' through these beats
Dope boy, you can tell by my sneaks
Burnin' Amsterdam green where it falls like a leaf
[Outro]
I'm speakin' on unwritten laws, the code of the streets
I'm not the type of nigga that you bump into at a 7-11 and just pull your pistol on him
And do what the fuck you want to do
Niggas like me, you gotta get permission homie
And that could take a long time!
In that time, I'mma handle my motherfuckin' business..
Ugh! Ugh!
It's the red light district, nigga this Amsterdam
Wherever the fuck I'm at
It's a no go
We green light you bitch niggas

Walk with a real nigga
Self-made millionaire (M-M-M-Maybach Music)
What more could you ask for, huh?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm a kamikaze in a Maserati
I'm a John Gotti, got my own army
Worth fifty million and it's all on me
Fifty on my Rollie, knowin' yours phony
Last problem I had, a nigga headshot him
Say the word on the street is that my man got him
If I wasn't involved you wouldn't hear about him
I got Lears and all, don't need Aaliyah problems
May she rest her soul, I got a sleeping problem
All my CDs gold but the Visa darker
Bastard child but I got a fleet of cars
Double MG this little thing of ours
Take it to the door, a motherfucker plea
Niggas layin' on your crib while your momma sleep
Home-cooked meals for the real niggas
Hot TEC-9 for you little niggas
Wanna shoplift? Come and boost this
We run the fucking game, nigga, truth is (Maybach Music)
Cargo pants and my red bottoms
Talking 'bout birds, you know the boy got 'em
[Hook: French Montana]
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds (Hah)
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds (Hah)
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds (Hah)
And I ain't going back, I'ma ball first (Uh)

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Anything you need, know I get it cheap (Hah)
My nigga Rozay make millions while he getting sleep (Hah)
Cars European, come and see the fleet (Hah)
We're commercial, come and see us if you need the street (Hah)
I'ma bring it home nigga, bet the bank (Hah)
Sierra Leone all up in the link (Bling)
'Bout to double up, Mason Betha shit (Hah)
Huddle up, round table, King Arthur shit (Arthur shit)
Shorty ass fat, she can't stand straight (Hah)
Spent your down payment on my landscape
Niggas sideways like the Phantom door
Hundred round drum sound like round of applause (Blrrt!)
Slicker than a can of grease
Paid the state in the ice, hundred grand a piece
Coke Boy, I'll be thirty for sure now
Coke damn near same price as dope now (Hah)

Do you know what we are going to do? We are going to defend ourselves because Huey P. Newton says that, ""Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner."" Power is the ability to define phenomena and make it act in a desired manner. Power: if we have the ability to define it, the only next thing to do is get organized. So when a pig walks up to you, or when a pig gets to jiving with the people you be so organized you be learning some tactics, you be learning some revolutionary principles, you be having some guns hid out somewhere, you have some proper tactics that when the pig gets to jiving with you, the pig is wrong, you whip your guns out on him, blow him away, and then you have made the ability, in fact, you have made that pig act in a desired manner

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Smokin' a fat spliff in a brand new Benz
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin
Hah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Lookin' in the mirror but I don't see much
Still runnin' the streets so I don't sleep much
Watchin' the snakes so they don't creep up
But the way I'm gettin' this money, niggas can't keep up
You niggas can't keep up
Niggas got beef but it can’t be much
I'm still walkin' through the crowds like I can't be touched
Top back all black, Gretzky puck
Ice skater lil' later might let me fuck
Damn, she might let me fuck
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Vacheron on my wrist a year ago
I didn't even know the bitches exist
Quarter milli for the mothafucka
No insurance on the mothafucka
Ain't life a bitch?
But you gotta keep her wet
Keys open doors so I gotta keep a set
Everybody know that I'm a lotta people's threat
Biggie Smalls in the flesh livin' life after my death
Yesterday I read my horoscope
Tell me Lord will I be poor and broke?
Tell me Lord will I be dealin' dope?
I wanna take my momma to the Poconos
But only Lord knows
[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Goodbye, to all the loved ones I leave behind
At least they can't see me cry
And I ask, when someone wants to be me, whyyyy
Thought havin' everything would ease my mind
If you could read my mind
My God, I'm scarred, I have tattoo tears of joy

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did I do to deserve this?
Young rich motherfucker still uneducated
But dammit a nigga made it
Goddamn a nigga made it
Crib bigger than a church, Lord know I'm blessed
Five different lawyers, Lord know I’m stressed
A punch in the face get you 300K
Ask Vlad, now he back to makin' minimum wage
Another victim of my criminal ways
I wanna walk in the image of Christ
But that bitch Vivica nice
And I'm still swimmin' in ice
I'm just livin' my life
I'm just livin' my life
Lease a Lamborghini for your pussy rate
Life is just a pussy race
Snatch a bitch take her back to your place
Next morning I can tell you how the pussy taste
I got expensive taste

Goodbye, to all the loved ones I leave behind

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Last night I cried tears of joy
What did we do to deserve this?
Not to dwell on the the past but to keep it real
I gotta represent for Emmett Till
All the dead souls in the field
Lookin at my Rollie it's about that time
White man had a problem with mine
And we suppose to be shy?
The revolution's televised
Bobby still on the rise

Going hard was a given; the chance I wasn't given
Til I pulled right beside her, she was sitting in the Civic
Man, you was just who I was looking for
Top down, you could never overlook a boy
Big buckets, magnum bottles of that rose
On my R. Kelly, girl I'm bout that foreplay
Slow it down, speed it up, I'm just being me
Panamera here's the keys, thats just the G in me
Got a crib on the water, need a bathing suit

Turning money down, we just laying in bed
She blowing money wild, bundles of bread
Times are priceless, it can go to your head

Y'all niggas know what this is
If you don't know
I'm finna break it down

[Verse 1]
I just upped my stock, fuck them cops
If you love hip-hop bust them shots
Your man is priceless, if your man's loyal
Better give that man a raise or end up paying for it
If you cut it, call it Jam Master Jay
No Adidas but I rock a brick a day
Talk about the jewels outta nigga reach
Nigga please, so I came back with a bigger piece
You still smokin' weed on your car chase
I'm pullin' off the car lot screaming: ""God’s great!""
Before the crib you gotta clear the guard's gate
Elevators like Frank's on Scarface
New Presidential had that pavé
Like a G, I gave the Cartier to Wale
Then I gave Meek Mill a Range Rover
Told Warner Brothers that the game's over

[Interlude]
For me to move forward from here on I need 50
I ain't talking 50 Cent neither nigga, haha
[Verse 2]
I came back a rich nigga
Young mogul, Bo Jackson, I'm a switch hitter
They want me face down on the pavement
Gang members claimin' I need to make a payment
It's hard for a young black executive
Can't you see we're all fucking relatives
Relatively easy we can go to war
Fuck it, we can go to war
Chasing me a hundred million, that's inshallah
Fresh up out the Feds system, welcome home Jabar
I watch him pray five times a day, nigga
Same one that used to moved the yay' nigga
AK's in his heyday, nigga
Benz coupe, wood frames, low fade, nigga
Got the cubans, got the boats, got the zoes, nigga
Cocaine worth much more than gold, nigga
So what's your goals, nigga?
All my shit went gold, nigga

[Verse 3]
I remember smokin' mid grade
'Til I went and got my shit straight
I'm spittin' like this bitch a mixtape
'Til they seen a Ghost with a temp plate
Sittin' in the trap blowing thick smoke
Trafficking my dope, with a thick ho
Feds tore apart the squad, nigga
That's why I had to play the part, nigga
That wasn't me, it was a job, nigga
It gets deeper, that was just a start, nigga
Screamin' in my sleep, I know Lord hear me
Death to you fuckboys, on my 4th Bentley

Ain't no friends we ain't even on that
All these niggas taking Instagrams, selfies
Point me to the money
Point me to the money
Business, big business
Maybach business
If you ain't with it I don't fuck with you

[Hook]
You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed
My brother caught a L and I still write him every month
He told me sell his guns and I still got 'em in the trunk
I wonder why, I wonder why
I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why
I wanna shine just like the summertime
They say them folk gave him a heap of time

[Verse 1]
Nappy-headed nigga, pocket full of crack rock
Nineteen, living like a fucking rap star
Watching from my point you thought it was a fucking film
One day he buy the car, next day the fucking rims
Curly-headed bitches, tall and they slim
They know him as the myth but see I know it's him
Never testify, I seen it in his eye
Attempted murder on his life in that 360i
With my two eyes
Two different pistols
One with registered and one to get your issue
I wonder why, sometimes I wonder why
All this fame and fortune leave you traumatized
[Hook]
You ain't gotta hold my hand, and point me to the money
Keep it real with me nigga and you won't be disappointed

Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker
Now I'm being followed by some creepy-ass cracker
Stand your ground, stand your ground
Stand your ground, you gotta stand your ground

[Verse 2]
Got on my hoodie and my motherfucking Desert Eagle
You wanna do me, then you go and tell the people
Knock me down, temp drops as the sun rise
I could see a hustler in my son's eyes
I never knew that money bring so many enemies
Dreams come true, they dream of killing me
But it's fuck 'em and I feed 'em fish
Them killers coming, 'X' you off the list

Bill: Look at this stuff, this is history here...you're history
Mike: This is garbage...I can say I bled for garbage
Bill: So this is meaningless...
Mike: No, at one time it meant a lot. When you're just a young kid this is everything to you, then you realize your priorities change. And you just want your children to be happy and do nice things and that makes you happy. This is nothing. This is just nothing man...

[Intro: Rick Ross]
Ugh, God Forgives and I Don't
That's one of my many emotions, that's one of my many flaws
I am flawed, it may not seem that way but I am
So don't play with me

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I can talk about the bodies, I could tell you 'bout the killing
Duct taping niggas in the name of drug dealin'
Big body Benzes while the bitch niggas starve
Turtleneck Mercedes blowin' smoke up out the top
Time to talk about the money, I can tell you bout a profit
Oceanfront spot moving niggas out the projects
Diamonds on my neck call it the ghetto's guillotine
Fuckin' with them jewelers nigga lit up like a screen, HD
Look at me ballin' I'm talkin' high definition
Fuckin' up six digits, boy that's just my definition
Niggas gotta get murked but I'm just minding my business
Bought three Range Rovers dolo, so fuck Expedition
On the road to the riches until I'm paid in full
And the Lord is my witness, I got a AK to pull
These niggas full of shit, my niggas moving bricks
I could front you fifty, but you gotta move 'em quick, my moolah thick
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Went and got me a choppa to put it right in ya face
Better blow out your brains before you give me a case
Got the forty by my dick I keep on pissin' on the hammer
When they talkin' slick I double back with that banana
High definition I'm stacking money to the ceiling
Fuck my ho feelings, look here, it's time to make a killin'
Got a hundred silent niggas and they fiending for a million
High definition bitches, my life a motion picture

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I could talk about the bitches, I could tell you 'bout the bricks
Pull up in the Bentley I could pop up in the six
Helicopter rides I can sit it on the club
Sound of the propeller had my young bitch busting nuts
Niggas wanna crack jokes just to get close to me
Hope you know that I'm strapped like I supposed to be
Put a number on your helmet like it's Notre Dame
5 grand'll get you whacked, won't even know your name
Road to the riches until I'm paid in full
And the Lord is my witness we making major moves
God forgives and I don't, I got it tatted in my skin
I'm going straight to hell that's if ballin' is a sin
Crucifix on my neck I pray it never melt
Pacquiao purse, boy I took another belt
Take a seat, I'm undefeated in this art of war
Rest in peace to the pussies, it's time to scar some more
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Went and got me a choppa to put it right in ya face
Better blow out your brains before you give me a case
Got the forty by my dick I keep on pissin' on the hammer
When they talkin' slick I double back with that banana

This that Rich Forever part two

Layin' in my bed, I'm under these gold chandeliers
Can't say too many names in here these kinda years
Nice sweaters and these icy diamonds on my wrist
Ice Cube lookin' nigga, you know life a bitch
I once got no allowance, now I got the crown
I said I was The Boss, nobody made a sound
Really had to see them things, this level story tellin'
Who else could flip a chorus into 40 million?
Out in Cannes with Leonardo DiCaprio
While out on bond, pray I go to trial rapido
Eight felonies, tellin' me wanna give me life
Every nut I bust, really, I gotta do it twice
Ricky Ronaldo, really when I'm in Portugal
I pull a yacht out, this weekend, I'm fuckin' so-and-so
Cameras flash, paparazzi layin' in the grass
Tom Brady my new neighbor, you can tell 'em that

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Uh, I think she like me
Oh, I think she like me
I know her nigga don't like me
With your bitch right now, yeah, I might be
Sippin' this right now, yeah, we might be (Ooh, ooh)
Might hit her from the back, let her ride me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another nigga like me (Ooh, ooh)
Girl, you never meet another man like me

I'm sexin' women, out on Fisher Isle
I gas her up and let her lick me down
I may name my daughter Hermes
Get Margiela to decorate the new birds nest
20 million up at Merrill Lynch
I met his chick, he haven't seen her since
Through the city, I'm still floatin' like a magic carpet
She stop me for a selfie, I just want the knowledge
Expressin' what you think'll send your kids to college
Or be a Geechi nigga just to keep the Bentley polished
Do it for the dear departed, fuck a Ben Carson
Empowering the youth made a nigga a target
Only one that's smokin' up in Goldman Sachs
But I'm the only one that's rollin' like a quarter back
And I never put it in my government
'Cause I never put on for the government

You caught the case, you gotta post the bond
I'm Rayful Edmond mixed with young Wale Folarin
Starin' in my safe, I'm rather safe than sorry
Diddy, Jigga only two niggas comin' for me
I park the Caddy in my livin' room
Pussy niggas lookin' for me, I'ma give it to 'em
Santorini, Greece, sex in the swimmin' pool
If her pussy dry, call her Beetle Juice
I'm baby-makin' in them Maldives
Put up all the yachts, pulled out the jetskis
Khaled hit me on the FaceTime (It's Billi!)
I'm the flyest nigga on his bassline
She see the sneakers and she see the stones
Fat boy run the city, seated in the throne
I'm cashin' in like the Kardashians
My paralyzed homie snuck the ratchet in

She fell in love with a dope boy
Black diamonds on the neck of that dope boy
Big body Benz for that dope boy
Love every tattoo on that dope boy
She sheds tears for that dope boy
Shit, it is what it is for that dope boy
Handle minor biz for that dope boy
But the reward is major, so on and so forth
She can tell you by the Greyhound
She can show you how to stay down
I can tell you 'bout to break down
VS1's all in my bitch watch face now
Straight G's for your low esteem
A.P's for the whole team
As I run away from my obituary
Walkin' in the shit that'll get you buried
Miami's mine like I'm Pat Riley
Baselines shooters nigga, act wisely
Get the picture, niggas gettin' richer now
Livin' next to bitches, out on Fisher Isle
Down from Oprah, Don King, and Sosa
Come to the coca, callate la boca
They letting shit slide when my nigga won't
Remember God forgives and them triggers don't
[Chorus: Omarion]
Aw baby, it's just how it goes
Can't feel it but I know you know
Cause I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I keep it on the outside of you, girl
And I'm reaping just what I've sewn
My heart's beating but it still stay froze
And you're waiting on the inside for me, girl
And you're waiting on the inside

She fell in love with the lifestyle
Paper tag now her neck all iced out
Lear jets to the fights now
Belagio crap table with the dice out
Floor seats at the Heat game
Her bag 20 grand, nigga, peep game
South beach makin' love on the rooftop
Fuckin' to the rhythm, got her singin' like she Jill Scott
I'm just a nigga with a attitude
Earnin' revenue through different avenues
One of my soldiers died in Attica
Anythin' other than to ride is out of character
Top down and it feels right
I could tell you what a dope boy feels like
I could tell you that he never sleeps
He may smile but it's never sweet
Swisha burnin' at his fingertips
Tears on the inside but they never drip
God forgives and the courts don't
Seekin' an appeal when the courts won't

Ain't no space in the garage, I got a new Buggati

(Bugatti Boyz) Yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I heard a young nigga had to sell his soul
For a new Bugatti and a ton of gold
Stepping in the crib, I gotta pat you down
So old school, still in my cap and gown
The lawn manicured and it's well lit
Talking whole sale, each 12-6
Order crab legs with the heavy butter
.357, perpetrator stumbles
Shots fired, and I fear the worst
Gift wrap his ass, December 1st
Underneath the tree, can a nigga sleep?
Yea I went and spent a hundred G's on a V

[Hook: Rick Ross]
One point five for the transport
Car got a letter B all on the asshole
Fuck a Swiss account, I got it all cash
If it's any problem, you can bring 'em all back
Know how a hustler move, do what he gotta do
Fuck the prosecutor, tell him the Bugatti's new
One point five settle all these civil suits
Platinum a million time, record in a silver suit
[Verse 2: Diddy]
The whole city screaming ""Where that boy Diddy at?""
Blue Yankee fitted, boy I brought the city back
I'm a Harlem nigga, I'm a Ciroc boy
Fuck a penthouse, I bought the block boy
Bought a Vacheron in London, costs a million pounds
Fuck a chick all in the shower like I'm trying to drown
Turn my back just like a king, I let her wipe me down
I'm Sean John down to my jeans, how you like me now
Hating ass niggas not my type of crowd
Gotta get a fade before I wear the crown
I hope you brought some money since you talking loud
We sipping Blue Dot and we smoking loud
I scoop a new broad just to knock her down
I get a new broad when she not around
Fuck a phone bill, bitch I'm worth a bill
She wanna feel the rush, I give her sugar hill

And I know it's superficial and you say it's just clothes
But we shoppin' in that motherfucker and they just closed
So go ahead and just pose
When she walked up out the dressing room, the store just froze

Tried to murder me while in mine so that's how I survived

Facts, never find me with the fake look
Trappin' little babies, bitch, just take me to the cakebook
Black bottles, boy, that's how our case of ace look
Your chick, homie, hit homie on the Facebook
Damn, she hit homie on the motherfuckin' Facebook

[Hook: Keith Sweat]
Tell me it's real, I wanna know
How does it feel, yeah, how does it feel?
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Clean Maybach, but I'm filthy as shit
The partition is for the women, how busy we get
From the scotch, the large mop, bet the linkin' feel
It's all a dream and never wake me up until it's real
Duffle bags, that's for the homie when he comin' home
He never told and he never used the telephone
He on swole and that nigga need a telephone
In a Range Rover and a real nigga got it for him

[Hook: Keith Sweat]
Hey, hey...
You wanna know how does it feel
Hey, hey...
I know, I bet it must feel so real
Hey, hey...
Tell me it's real, I wanna know hey hey ey
How does it feel to be so real

You know when hangin' with billion dollar niggas
One of the perks is gettin' to meet all these billion dollar bitches
I just met a bitch who never gets jetlag
And spent 10 thousand dollars on not her best bag

This shit make me feel a certain kind of way
Huh, this shit feel good right here
This shit feel like, some Carol City shit right here
My nigga Peanut, rest in peace
See you would felt this right here
I'm on my Convertible Burt shit

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm feelin' myself, hope you feelin' me too
God forgives and I don't, unforgettable dude
I'm ballin' my nigga, and that's word to your mama
I want you to ride, definition of honor
Honor thy brother, but murder these hoes
Always pay your taxes, never pay these hoes
Always making moves, I didn't make the rules
I'm just making ends meet with this plate of food
Went from Spaghetti-O's to a new set of Vogues
Back to square one, we still was selling those
My Tribe Called Quest, shit was nice dawg
Gucci was Q-Tip, I was Phife Dawg
On awards tours with all the wrong whores
Had the right ideas in all the wrong stores
Timing is everything, rhyming is everything
Geechi Liberace, put diamonds in everything

[Verse 2: Pharrell]
They say ""Skateboard, you racist
You only hang with white Cubans""
Nonsense, that's the necklace nigga, the light's moving
This is jewelry, that shit is foolery
Frozen water on my neck nigga, who cool as me?
Up in mansion like the black Kurt Cobain
My nigga Ross said he's the boss 'cause he works cocaine
And under no certain circumstances
Will the facets of the diamonds not be disrespectful
And hurt your chain
And your feelings, yeah, they villains
But I'm chilling, I'm still a N.E.R.D
Millions and millions and millions off of verbs
While my niggas be stealing and killing and thrilling for the birds
Making deals, squeezing the life out of them Nextel chirps
But, I'm on my iPhone (uhh)
Bitches put their naked pictures on my iPad
The doors go up and I gone
Black boy scoring his life, I'm scoring the Oscars (I'm really am, nigga)
Remember I used to want a Pasha and eat some lobster
But now I eat the apple with my AP
Your life and your wrist got the wrong timing, you hate me
Says the little boy that loves you, who had the ashy feet
Now I wear that ashy white suit out in Fashion Week (Yes, nigga)
Where the upper-classes meet, that's just me
I smash the beat

Uhh, dedication to motivation, gave 'em motives to hate me
Old homies betrayed me, running around saying they made me
But when I had a quarter, they had four and the baby
It was a whole different story, but fuck, them niggas is shady
Now I'm self-made, self-paid, and I give myself a raise
Whole circle shining nigga, never had no selfish ways
Never had nobody tell me go and get it, tell me save
Had to learn on my own, ask my mama, I was gone
Puffing purple getting stoned, tryna take the pain away
Now it's Rolls Royces, umbrellas for a rainy day
Old heads told me, ""Young fella, this ain't the game to play""
Had to take the chance, told the dealer, ""Deal my hand""
And now that nigga's getting murdered, shit is getting scary
I put mirror tint all on the Ghost, I'm screaming, ""Bloody Mary""
Nigga, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
Let 'em cross the line of scrimmage, they get fucking buried
They had me cutting through that field just like a rushing Barry
Sinners playin' with hammers
Had them birds but we ain't fuck with Larry
I was just tryna ball, ducking D's and grinding raw
But now I pull up in that thing
Them niggas gon' need some Tylenol, I'm gone!

[Verse 4: Stalley]
I'm staring at my notepad like goodbye to my broke past
Words full of money, use dollar signs as my periods
I'm gettin money - period!
They said I got a old soul and I'm rich nigga spirited
So one time for the old-timers and two for the new school
Three for my Geechi niggas with big Rollies in that new coupe
Blowing on loud, sipping on that dirty juice
With a tre-deuce, living life like they ain't made loot
'Cause what's here today could be gone tomorrow
So I'ma get it myself
I ain't known to ball, make sure my kids is straight
In case I'm gone tomorrow
Young Bonaparte, I'm noble dog like Drew Ali
Dark shades like Kool Moe Dee, cool fly nigga is who I be
Big chain with a bigger charm
Leave with a bad chick under my arm
Uhh! Geechi Liberace
Diamonds on everything, even my posse

She kissin' on me, bitin' on my bottom lip
In the Galleria all I get is buy me this
Conversations on the phone until the break of dawn
Combination to her home, I gotta make her moan
Mean hustle got me chasin' all this fast money
Balenciaga sneakers, now she touchin' cash money
So sexy in them all black Giuseppe heels
50 stacks in her bag so she know it’s real
Top off the Ferrari now we thugged out
Smokin' on that Cali, bumpin' 2Pac
It’s me against the world now, what’s your phone number?
Jumpin' in that Range Rover and I’m comin' over

But this is not the same for me
Bounce, love it how she always make it bounce
Rose petals on her bed, I walk in unannounced
I love it when she speak a different language (papito!)

Born stunna, and my baby so stunnin'

In the streets you know I’m eatin' like a lion feast
Lick a nipple tryna tickle all the finer things
Keys to the crib, keep it trill, time to handle biz
Big dreamer, new Beamer, just the realest nigga

There's so many things that I don't understand. Sometimes, being in the position I am, with no malicious intent, my nigga, you can take it how you want it. I see it from both sides, I feel a nigga pain

[Verse 1]
Learn to walk a tightrope
Ever seen a rich nigga go broke?
They putting liens on a nigga's things
Publicize your demise, and by all means
Your family fortune is forever what you stood on
Sold dreams, fantasies that put the hood on
You reap what you sow, and they speaking repossessions
To the culture itself, these are powerful lessons
These niggas always smiled when I came around
They let you know my reputation when you in my town
A real nigga, you gonna know that by the contract
Bottom line blood, show me where them one’s at
That paper it get funny when publishing is involved
Mechanicals never mattered because that was your dog
Now you hands-on, but things don’t ever seem right
You make a call to give your lawyer the green-light
He look into it then hit you up with the bad news
It’s so familiar, he did the same with the last dudes
Mafioso, baby girl, cash rules
Every dollar accounted for, double M the crew

[Hook]
Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life
The white man call us stupid niggas
We spend it all, nothing for our children
Had it all, now it’s repossessed
Can’t feed the clique cutting bad checks
Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel
[Verse 2]
Planting poison in a nigga mind
Chilling with your boys when it’s time to grind
We both come from those humble beginnings
Still can’t believe we never followed each other on Twitter
Funny thing is the animosity money brings
Real niggas out of style we may be one in three
Back against the wall outnumbered by fuckboys
One bullet, one target, one choice
You can take an L or take the shell
It's still double M still making mills
Made niggas respect my hustle on both coasts
I put the word out to see who hit back with the lowest
I need a hit handled, put me in touch with the closest
You still digging through ashtrays killing the roaches
And I never took an L back when Meek fell
Just drove the numbers all the way back up at retail

[Hook]
Death Row, fast life
Foreclosed on my past life

Time to learn boy, that cash rules
Success is a precious jewel
[Verse 3]
Can’t be writing checks with your eyes closed
While you living out of homes in different time zones
Mind blown finna strip you out your rhinestones
Pistol to your ear, this that level I’m on
I apologize woadie but this all I got
Everybody in this office we could die tonight
I never met an artist who fully recouped
These the deals the deal  dealers wanna deal to you
Young niggas, time to act your wage
Buying belts you seen on other niggas waists
Hoes fucking for follows, they wanna post online
Whole time, shorty knowing I’m not gon' mind
Put it on all he needed was a co sign
Black minks and gloves, nigga, the whole nine
TV on the Rolls, shit, I had to hold mine
You’ll foreclose or fold just for soul signs

Paths cross, of course your life lost
""Patience a virtue. Heard that you're the boss""

Now give me enormous respect
Cornered the game, record label on his chain
Right hand on the bible watch the flow catch flame

Now she riding with a lame all jealous in the Jeep
All the lil homies wanna eat
But we never settle beef
So settle your debts before there's any regrets

Ain't no church in the wild
For a nigga like me in the game so foul
In a world full of sin where the love flow thin
And the pain run deep 'cause it's blood in the streets
See the stains on the money, no love for the weak
Where it rain, never sunny, just mud on a beach
Where a hater sticks to you like mud on a cleat
Thanksgiving with them birds, just drugs for a feast
Young'un only 13 with a snub in his fleece
Even though his heart's cold, he in love with the heat
See the high in his eyes, hear the slugs in his speech
From the bottom out of Philly, I emerge from the east

Never trust a bitch that tell you she ain't blown nothing

Tears dripped on my dad casket
Niggas turned me into a bastard (Maybach Music)

Get to reaching, I'm squeezing on him and clapping (Rrrrah)
And I ain't talking 'bout assemblies

[Intro: Rick Ross]
I pray we all live forever
I pray I'm a servant to all prophets
May I be rich forever

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Money on my head, pussy, boy, that ain't enough
Pull up to your trap strapped in my armored truck
Your mami house next, tell that bitch to duck
Ain't no sympathy in the inner city streets
That's all I ever heard from my older G's
She say she love me, but I know she play for keeps
Slip a black snake in a nigga's sheets
Bought a bitch a hundred acres, all red roses
Half you niggas Judas, I'm the son of Moses
Illuminated, resurrected as Selassie
Bob Marley through the trumpets on the day I die
Rolls Royces on dirt roads, we dopeboys

[Bridge: Rick Ross]
Baptized by the dopeboys, ordained by the assholes
My salvation is the cash flow
Woah, oh
I'm walkin' on air
[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm talkin' big, bitch, I'm talkin' big
I'm talkin' big, bitch, I'm talkin' big
We do it big, bitch, we do it big

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
I'm into fashion, nigga, John the Baptist
My loyalty respected all across the atlas
I can have you and your team finalized
All your kids screamin' at Mount Sinai
Holy Ghost, the divine spirit
My heart pure, he a real nigga
She let me fuck early so she trustworthy
Her pussy sacred so she gettin' all the purses
In his name I'm Supreme Lord
The Book of Leviticus is the springboard
Jesus Christ, look at this nigga's ice
Better yet, look at this nigga's life
I'm walkin' on air

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
You already know, I give and go and I get that dope
Nigga with that O, I move that shit like tic-tac-toe
And these be niggas hatin' like ''Meek Mill, how you get that ho?''
Cause I get that dough, and I switch that flow
Just check my style, look at that Ro', on my wrist
On some shit, make a call, ""Who is this?""
Think it's Benji on the line and he called, tried to flip
What I do? Make a call, call Papi for a brick
And papi call José, cause José got fish
Now I'm 30,000 feet up with my feet up, rollin' weed up
Pussy niggas couldn't bluff us, couldn't beat us
Throwin' curveballs in the field get you hit like Derek Jeter
Double M, yeah that's the team, I know they see us, yeah
[Bridge: Rick Ross]
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm talkin' big, bitch, I'm talkin' big
I'm talkin' big, bitch, I'm talkin' big
We do it big, bitch, we do it big

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Fuck a tutor, better get a shooter
Teach your ass a lesson when they runnin' to ya
Fiends linin' up like we havin' communions
This my daily bread and you niggas consumers
All I ever wanted was to make scrilla
Have a recordin' session with J Dilla
Selassie, Exodus
Corinthians, Leviticus
I'm on the books, I study well
Gettin' money, bitches know me well

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
My corner so polluted, young niggas lootin'
I studied Kenneth Williams, I'm one hell of a student
Remarkable hustle, my niggas comin' home
I kept the candle lit, my nigga never rowed
Niggas caught him slippin', gave him a shit bag
Five shots to the stomach, 2Pac gift pack
It's death row, conspiracy theories
Concealed indictments handed to the grand jury
Get some money now, you hated by your own kind
The home invasion done by niggas in your bloodline
GABOS, game ain’t based on sympathy
So he put a hit on his cousin and auntie
Her sweet potato pies, oh me, oh my
Showin' no remorse, watchin the others cry
Heroin sales, detectives'll sell
A lot of yellow tape, where that Obama care?
This the mob, bitch, silk underwear
Yeezy concerts, Kim Instagrams
Niggas hatin', though they studied my moves
I'm like Farrakhan, in view of hundreds of Jews
Two attempts on my life, they threatened venues
Can't you see what I am? The hustle continue
I bought more jewels, I ordered the Wraith
I got a new style of shoes, match the watch in the face
Bill Belichick, coachin' and callin' the shots
Throw a yellow flag, pussy nigga body drops
Then we celebrate, black bottles pop
Time to elevate, we re-open shop
Wale a genius, Meek Mill a superstar
My new crib in Phoenix, ten car garage
Patek Philippe, platinum Audemars
Ain't no tags needed, nigga, I own them cars
I know them bitches, we met them broads
Never loved one, fucked them all
I'm a fuckin' dog, Ricky fuckin' Ross
Nigga, Birkin bags just for my runner-ups
But my main bitch she get the main dish
Not the old range, that was a lame bitch
Brazilian weave, she say I came quick
I let her see a hundred ki's, a gift from St. Nick
Movin' bricks like it's Black Friday
She gotta fuck me or call me a fat crybaby
Lookin' over my shoulder, I can't trust a soul
Bought a spot in Anguilla just for me and my ho
Glock .40, even when I shower
Chrome .22 in my swimmin' towel
Mob ties and I pray the music set me free
May the powers that be better let me be
[Hook: Mavado]
Ya better not be around when the sun goes down
And the real, real killers them out for ya
It's gonna be be a bloodshed
One buss, one dead, it's gonna be a bloodshed
Gun- gunshot inna head

[Verse 2: Mavado]
Payback is a motherfucker
Yes I feel it when I squeeze the trigger
I feel the air when my enemies die
I feel the strength of ten killer
What is to be will be
Only God alone can kill me
‘Cause these fuckin' streets filthy
And I ain't fuckin' guilty

[Verse 3: Sizzla]
Gangsta no take no chat from no guy, know why?
Violate a gangsta and bullets fly, bwoy die
Guns go off, or so we say
Murderation, anywhere
Gangsta no take no chat from no guy, know why?
Violate a gangsta and bullets fly, bwoy die
Guns go off, or so we say

Ya better not be around when the sun goes down
And the real, real killers them out for ya
It's gonna be be a bloodshed
One buss, one dead, it's gonna be a bloodshed

Sizzla Kolanji and Rick Ross have the girls them screaming

With the Grey Poupon, anything 'Ye poop on
Will explode, 'cause I am the shit, and this is my commode
Uh-oh, there they go
Talking 'bout how your boy's clothes extra tight
I just remembered that my limelight extra bright
I hit the strip club and girls get extra hype
You hit the strip club and girls turn extra dyke
We know who not getting no sex tonight
And a lap dance'd probably be a blessin', right?
So all the shit you talking dead, coffin
Like the weed, coughing, new crib, loft in
Where it's at? Austin, where is that? Texas
What's in front? Benzes, what else? Lexus
Well, who's Maybach is this? Mr. West's!

Now I got so many horses, bitches call me Polo

Yeah, you know I got them both, beat your ass black and blue
(Yeah!) I was barely gettin' pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter, Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Lookin' in the mirror, I can see the real contender
Celery for Eben Gregory, I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is you telling me other than your gender?

Sweet as banana-split every time I peel through
Fresher than Will Smith and Uncle Phil too

God is great, first and foremost, uhh
Don't you wish everything could be so perfect?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Free enterprise, overexposed
Irritated, uneducated still scribble my flows
The jubilation, the euphoria
Pushing a foreign in the morning, pick your daughter up
Drop your seed off, let the weed up
Slow motion, fast forward till we speed up
Grinding 'til my new accountant is fully at ease
Beefing with broke niggas really like pulling my teeth
Get away from me! You looking so suspicious
Light pocket, heavy hearted, you simple minded niggas
Don't be jealous of me, I keep enough foes
Get all the sneakers, not enough clothes
You can have the ex, I got enough hoes
You can have my next, once we a month old
Reptile black, Birkin Bamboo handle
Now the trophy on the mantle, well I got a Phantom
Being down and out was inconceivable
When you find out the one you love is just misleading you
Tryna make a living, remain spiritual
Egotistical ways I embraced back in middle school
If the chick was game, we would run a train
Send her home on a bus, then forget her name
But now the bitches be the realest ones
I done cried on her shoulder when I'm feeling numb
Seen a man get life and never shed a tear
But his daughter in the night never pierced her ears
Time will come when all that nice shit disappears
Why you think I'm on the night shift with the pills?
Mind frame of that boy that was found slain
Mild slang, you can tell I been around 'caine
Double R, Ricky Ross, bitch we been the gang
Bottom of the black market, time to rise again
[Interlude: Rick Ross]
My inner Andre 3000, uhh

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
So many false allegations, is my image tainted
3 weeks in the hole, as if a nigga heinous
As I'm pacing in the cell all this pictures painted
All i wanted was some Belaire and a Danish
Inmates gave me commissary just because I'm famous
Or is it cause' I'm rich and I know what pain is?
Assassinate Trump like I'm Zimmerman
Now accept these words as they came from Eminem
Democratic party sentenced to the pendulum
Killing them, I voted for Andre Benjamin
Head of black music, do you know what rhythm is?
Stick your hand in the basket, it gets venomous
Straight player, my chicks finish my sentences
Time to squash to beef, I kill a nemesis
Show up at the wedding in my Timberlands
And for the record, know my best man'll kill a bitch

[Outro: John Legend]
So if I die before I wake
Say I, I lived my way
Never said I would be perfect (no)
Never said that I deserved it (no)
Never said I wouldn't lie (no)
Never said I wouldn't make my mom cry (no)
But if I'm gon' die, I believe it's alright
It was so amazing, so amazing (as I look back on my)
It was so amazing, so amazing
I wouldn't change a thing, no no no
No, ohh
It was so amazing, so amazing, ohh

I live by the code, wardrobe from 'round the globe
All I need is a kilo, an apron, show me the stove
General Electric perfected, cooking them O’s
No more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves
Hoes, I need a condom for my toast
Busting in these niggas, standing flat-footed, I’m on my toes
Froze, pandemonium overdose
Paparazzi in the trees, please, curtains closed
Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf
Heroin transactions with Russian shots of the Smirnoff
Playing for keeps, I bust in 'em before she get off (Huh)
I run the city, just pull up and drop the kid off
Hah, welcome to organized crime
Money got me excited, I’m cumming four or five times
The .45 for you niggas with nine lives
Penthouse on Collins, money long as Ocean Drive
Black Chevy Tahoes, Haitians up out the potholes
My place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos
Feds get involved, I'm slipping off into Senegal
Issue your warrant, informant and bitch I've been a boss
Counting money stacks, yours is counterfeited
I made my money back when your accountant didn’t
Went against the odds, there's only one Rozay

Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop
Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number one niggas your bitch noticing

Rollin', we rollin', yeah
Million ways to make this money, you gon' get it
On the grind 24/7, I’m with it
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid
Jumping out the Phantom like a muh'fuckin' midget
Money knocking at the front door, I'm like, ""Who is it?""
""It’s Benji"", tell my little nigga go and get it
Cause I’ve been counting all this dirty paper for a minute
Lamborghini dreaming, thinking how I’m gon' spend it
I’m like one's for the money, two's for the show of it
Three's for the bitches that be fucking for the ho of it
Four for my niggas that be stacking it then blowing it
You would think I had a curfew the way I’m going in
Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium
Papi got them keys in, he like my custodian
I was tryna bag a brick, you was Nickelodeon
I was in them trenches getting down and dirty serving it
We is part the reason that them churches got some services
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing the murdering
Nigga called my phone talking reckless, I ain't heard of it
Fuck your girl, give her back, I’m courteous
I can keep a secret with Vicky, have a menage with Nicki
And be out London with Lauren and tellin Meagan ""Good morning""
Catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton with Paris
From Hollywood to the hood, I want a mom and I swear
That I want 'em all, wanna fuck 'em all
Had my niggas down so I’m screaming, ""Fuck the law""
Monday night wrestling, I’m so fucking raw
She gon wipe me down, I’ma brush her off
I’m way harder than the concrete, I say what my mind speak
Word to the homie Ross, I can get that nine piece
For the low, that nine cheap, call me if you want it, haters see me
And I'm stunting, got 'em sick into their stomach, ha

So all that shit you niggas kicking, we ain't worried about
Catch me at the carry out, mumbo sauce and half-and-half

And I am dead serious, bitch I spit with embalming

Sort of remind you why you don’t court no vagina
Just give 'em awesome intercourse and ignore their inquires

You dreamed of getting cream, best believe I’m John Deere
Sip greenest, Moncler shit, earth tones in the winter
Purp rolled in a 'rillo, I am on my John Lithgow
Out of this 3rd Rock, nigga air it out
I am on my Tom Brady, y’all niggas is Eric Crouch
What the bloodclot? Tommie Frazier, fuck yourself

Got the baddest women in the world for me to feed on

Columbia to Mexico, I figured was a better route
Look at me, a model now, models and them bottles 'round
A Blood holla, ""Ballin,'"" but the boys in blue, they shot 'em down
Gang-affiliated, colors prosecutors painted
Cause the niggas I employed name synonymous with mayhem
Instrumentals that are mental, Maybach kind of mental
400 off the lot, the block is monumental (Boss)

Like Heaven in the sky, even a better ride
In the rear, so many instruments I hear
Tucked behind curtain, no sign to fear

Like being this fly, 'til then, I'm just gon' ride
I'm like G Rap with better transportation
On the road to the riches, reach my final destination
In the lear, closer to Aaliyah, say a prayer
Hope I get to see her when I disappear from here, baby, yeah
But I don't see the endin' through these millionaire lenses
Just the two M's on the emblem
The partition roof, translucent and humidor
Refrigerators, where Ace of Spades or two I store

Pledge allegiance to the flag

Pull a plug, brain dead, dope game nigga

Caution, I'll approach you with a business mind
Slight two-step as I check the time
Rub my hands when my palms itch
50 in the bank, diamonds looking flawless
This the sway of a rich nigga
Praying for the day my nigga seeing six figures
Black bottles popping when I'm on the turf
Two private jets what this nigga's worth

[Hook: The-Dream]
No girl, under 10
No whip under a hundred grand
Man I make this money dance
I Chris Craft, she sun tans
Propellers out the window over islands
Where I land
Girl, we make that money dance

[Bridge: The Dream & Rick Ross]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
You rolling with the real niggas, you know we got it
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Uh, I feel wonderful, how about yourself?
You rolling with the real niggas, you know we got it
Check, uh
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
As the world turn and the weed twist
Flew a hundred niggas to Vail on a ski trip
Put away the dope, we can see the slopes
We built this shit together why it mean the most
Head-on collision, somehow I walk away
Give you music for free, recouping with the yay
You're rocking with the bowtie don
In God we trust, I bust and post bond
In the hood, we the Run-DMCs
Best quotes and ropes we don't need
Death Row on foul like Cool C
Big flossy, the bitches like ""Who's he?""
The corvette was a beast, I had to lease
Six months then we're free to holler ""Peace!""
Dead wrong my nigga, Miami river cops
Leave you floating there, hope of getting them ten a pop

[Interlude: Rick Ross]
Caution, I'll approach you with a business mind
Slight two-step as I check the time

[Verse 4: The-Dream]
Atlanta, Miami, Rosé
We like 2Pac and Vante
They sent my nigga on house arrest
I'm coming through nigga, they ain't stopping this
I bring the beach to the front door
All bitches out the pool, we need to park the boat
Turn South Georgia to Florida
And turn the rest over to the lawyers
Cause we ain't tryna hurt nobody
Just tryna bring life to the party
If I ain't change your mind, think whatever
One thing you can't change is I changed the weather
And this my Roc-A-Fella flow
And you just on hella dope, I'm hella dope
This for real niggas with Maybachs
All debts forgiven, this is the payback

[Outro: The-Dream]
Yeah, see what I did right there?
I just made that money dance
Hah! Oh shit, Ross
Dance, dance, dance, dance
And we live from Atlanta, Georgia nigga!

Yeah, yeah, once again my friend
See you on the other side

Excuse the marijuana, just tryina enjoy my self
We got some gangstas in the house too

I gotta bunch of dollars, I can spend them on her
Now she can be my lady, she can be my lover
Call me on the late night, get right, he ain't actin' right
Every superwoman needs a superman, here I am

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Sight seein', we might be in
The quattroporte or the new white BM
Home from FAMU with a gorgeous face
Next semester, she transfer to Florida State
Cookin' like Home EC for financial aid
I helped her out, she had problems with financial aid
Remember? Mean time our finance is straight
I even up the doors to the financial estates (Ross)
She use to fight with her mom
'Til I sat 'em both down, now she tight with her moms
Yeah, I put the ice on her arm
Now she know she gettin' sliced, spendin' nights in Milan
We still blow weed together
Cheated on her but we still gon' be together
Put the house on the water, hit the beach whenever
She from the north and still can't believe the weather

Why you lookin' for the others when you got the best?
The previous was a test for ya, now ya in the big league
A black Steinbrenner, who wouldn't wanna play for me?
Ya last man was a chump and you can tell 'em I said it
He was talkin' loud at first but you can see that he didn't
You can see I ain't sweatin'
Hell I'll call him up myself and tell him how he can get it
Naw, please don't confuse me miss
I'm tryna see how I can put you on my Christmas list
I hope you ain't offended by this
But I think ya ass fine as shit
And that's straight up real talk, all bullshit aside
She replied, ""I, like to do the wild thing""
Actions took place, at my place
Now my place is her place

More better, more cheddar
Knocked ya man off the clothes line sweater
Hoe getter, gorilla
Fuck chauffeurs, I went and got more killas
I rock with niggas like Fabolous
Cause to tell the truth, life fabulous
But you make it look glamorous
Cause them strapped heels aren't for amateurs
Wrist quite rocky, talk like Foxy
Job like Roxy, spark that broccoli
Walk like Aki, that means sexy
I will save you, if you let me
Fly with me, get high as me
A lot of alphabets girl I'm a G

Some things you have to see for yourself
Francis Ford, fuckin' with them hoes
You niggas still can't afford

[Verse 1]
Made so many mistakes I know that my niggas relate
Just to rattle my cage, so much shit they sat on my plate
She know me through records, but she don't know me too well
All this game is for sale was priceless, I keep for myself
Shots fired, man expired in his Jordan 3's
Small talk, turn that page, that's all they ever read
You graduated, you still unemployed
Taken for granted, love is null and void
No longer one and few, young Langston Hughes
Jewish intuition, I'm followin' cues
Niggas own Versace, don't know Nikki Giovanni
Your paper chasin', can't see that it's runnin' from you
My homies from the block, they labeled me cunnin'
No excuse for my success, so they say I'm Masonic
I keep it one hundred, fuck her, I keep the car runnin'
How she fuck on the back, that's to keep food in the stomach

[Hook]
Look at me, look at me
Realest shit you niggas ever seen
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me
[Verse 2]
Playin' for keeps, and that's just to say at the least
Had a few seizures, nigga refused to get me some sleep
I let shit slide, I should see the sparks
Now I think about my moms when I jot these songs
I think of certain niggas when I mention guns
Heavy artillery, death to enemies number one
Francis Ford, flows you niggas can't ignore
Shoppin' with them hoes you niggas can't afford
Belaire Rose, they thought I'd go gold, wouldn't sell anything more
They thought I'd fail, they thought I'd fold
Go to hell, any nigga wanna buy my soul
Double-M, extend my hand, I see you stumblin'
Francis Ford films budget, double-forty M's
Godfather money, filmin' part four again
Butterball, Magic City, so you know it's him, me

Look at me, look at me
Realest shit you niggas ever seen
Look at me, look at me
Look at me, look at me

[Verse 3]
I blaze J's, fuck the Dutch slave trade
Fuck a net worth when I'm just trynna maintain
Tennessee, I felt like Mr. Wendal, nigga
When ain't nobody starin' out that window with you
Obligated, surrounded, when you are often hated
Left a bag of that dope when they flew off to Vegas
It was written, Mr. Jones, a different picture
Strong as bones like Corleones, the realest figures
Speakin' in native tongues, me, myself and I
Through Michael Rapaport eyes, it's just a lost trial
But I see the gems, I see the stars
Diabetes and all, your name will carry on
I pray this legacy is what is left of me
Corporate cannabis givin' me leprosy
Look at me, look at me

I got a pistol in the car (Ha), a .45
If I die today, remember me like John Lennon (Ha)
Buried in Louie, I'm talkin' all brown linen
Make all of my bitches tattoo my logo on they titty
Put a statue of a nigga in the middle of the city (Ugh)
Load up the choppers like it's December 31st
Roll up and cock it and hit them niggas where it hurts (Ayy)
Told on my partner and helped them crackers give him thirty
I told him I got it, therefore, I gotta do you dirty (I gotta)
Back on my biz, been in this bitch since 8:30
Scoop me a dime, now makin off at 10:30
Goin' on 12:00, go home and tell that man a lie
I got a bake sale, bitch, it's thirty for the pie (Ross)
It's nine for the slice, dummy, that's a Dan Marino (What)
Talkin' quarterbacks, meaning, talkin' quarter-kilos (Ayy)
Niggas feel my pain, I ain't even gotta say it (Boss)
Where I come from, if you open it, you payin'
How I can save when all my niggas in the can? (Can)
Am I my brother's keeper? Motherfucker, take my hand (Me)

And I'm quick to blow a milli in a minute (Woo)
I know them people wanna stick me with a sentence (Woo)
I'm a player catchin' bitches like I'm TO
Trunk full of work, yeah, this nigga think he Nino (Ugh)
Three dice, yeah, grab a nigga for a kilo
Pinky ring a hundred grand but keep that on the d-low
Diddy negotiates, send the paperwork to Theo
My niggas never sing, if I need 'em, I go to Ne-Yo
Fuck a famous bitch, then I treat her just like a ski-oh
Not even worth a shower, just grab me a stick of D-O

And the bitch that get a gift on the strength, she was a PO

I got these pussy niggas hating on a nigga
Since they wanna talk, I went and bought another chain
Forty cars, I gotta put em in my momma name
Heli-pad on my crib, my money outta here
Love my daughter to death, ten karats in her ear
Heavy ammunition for you fuck boys

I'm getting paid, I put that on my daddy grave
Got two hundred thousand in my Chevrolet
I'm the king of diamonds, my chain still speaking Ebonics
If she selling that pussy, bring it to baby, I got it
Drop a chicken in that grease and make one into two
All these rides in my yard, my shit a carnival

Automatic weapons on the floor, but who can you call?

Put this music shit aside get it in on the road
A lot of quiet time pink bottles of rose
Exotic red bottoms whole body glittered in gold
Following fundamentals and following in the rental
I love a nasty girl that swallows what's on the menu
That money triple up when ya get it out of state
I need a new safe cause I'm running out of space

I talk slicker than a pimp from Augusta
Who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches, what’s up witcha?
I hate callin’ the women bitches, but the bitches love it
I took some sense and made a nickel of it
I’m urgin’ all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You’re never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls countin’ on me to be there like missin’ rubbers
I’m on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of distant lovers
This ain’t the life that I’m used to
Reintroduced to people I’ve been introduced to
Did you forget me?
Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
And fear that I won’t remember
I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners have
I’m halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin’ like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazing shit
I got that Courtney Love for you, that crazy shit
I don’t drink every bottle I own, I be agin’ shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin’ shit
Which one of y’all got fleets on your keychains?
The seats for these Heat games?
I really think you stare at yourself and you see things
La Familia, I’ve been inducted and instructed
To stunt on these niggas we don’t really fuck wit
Fuck is up?
Havin’ lunch and debatin’ Ferrari prices
23 and goin’ through a midlife crisis
But trust me, I still deliver like a midwife
And no, I’m not sayin’ I’m the nicest, I just live life like it
Uh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood, but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
Because I haven’t hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body, she tells me live in the moment
And, baby, I’ll never forget none of that
Girl, I told you I was coming back

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I don't make love, baby we make magic
Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin'
Always wear a plastic, baby cause shit happens
She leaked the back seat, just to freak in the Magnum
Hopped out the Magnum, hopped in the Tre'
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight
Still in the streets, strapped with them thangs
She in love with the G, so she tatted my name (Ross!)
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Ten black Maybachs back to back in a lane
I'mma make it rain, and I'mma make it back
You are just a lame lil' homie, that's a fact
Workin' with the police, actin' like you know me
Fresh out of jail, already in yo' hoe cheeks

[Hook: T-Pain & (Rick Ross)]
I got a fresh line-up, yeah, a fresh outfit
'Bout to have the parkin' lot on smash
Plus I got a Chevy wit a fo'-fifty-fo' in the hood
That bitch got 125 on the dash (She like it gangsta cause)
(I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far)

Tell ya girlfriend come talk with me, dog
We straight Gs' then we came here to ball
Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you'll count 'em all
Then we off to that Chevy, fired up and takin' off
Baby, slow it down cause you movin' too fast
Ass too fine to be movin' too fast, hol' up
Back to the thuggin', now I'm sippin' sizzurp
All my niggas love it, baby that's my wizzerd

You can tell by the strongs that's standin' by the car

Fifty cal with a scope and a chopper, boy you got to
Plan a way straight to the undertaker, know me for the doctor
Should I die, lay me next to my daughter Lelah and my partner
Rap your ass off somethin' proper with that blocka, blocka, blocka

I used to play hard to get, like a sample on a hook
We used to play with the pots, you told me you was a cook
I was runnin' too long, he was chasin', didn't trip
How'd he do it? I don't know but somehow I got hooked
Thug passion, he's so compassionate
MMG, yeah, that's his acronym
Call him D-A-D-D-Y like I'm in a bassinet
He in pieces, he be all up into my fashion shit
Hold on, poppin', rockin', my panties, they match my slips
Been through it all; I could give a narrative
No fiction, nah, we ain't no characters
I mean if I bust my gun, you gon' bust yours too
Type to double up, you know that I ain't gon' fuck the budget up
Type of bitch deserve it all, who gon' compete with her?
He use to have a cold heart, cold heart
Now my ring finger doin' the double dutch

Caramel, she ride on top like it's a carousel
So infectious, I'm addicted, how would she ever fail
All my works are classic, maybe this my magnum opus
Too focused to give pussy to one of my soldiers
The loyalty is deep, she my Meryl Streep
My Michelle, we menage, do that through the week
On the phone, she had me listenin' to Boyz II Men
I'm tryna be at all the dope boy events
Food stamps now we dinin' on islands
Diced pineapples, now she's my piña colada
Put my coattail on my dawg I thought was my rider
Every day he wore a wire just like his designer
Some things are meant to be, some thing are meant to be
The day they sentence me, show me no sympathy

Got my pistol in her purse so she a cocky nigga
She tatted up and way too trill for cover ups
We both winnin', that's even when it's one of us
We switchin' cars right before the summer comes
She my people so I'm beefin' when that trouble come
Kissin' in the club, I'm grippin' on your hips
I'm richer than before; I hit a couple licks
Travelin', I leave the keys to all the cars
The hallway just like walking through the rainforest
Before producers started sendin' tracks
Once was a dependent on the income tax
You did the math and said you'd give me half
It was genuine when we would interact
So when I got the bag, I had to double back
Let go a milli, shit, it made me off a couple racks (Maybach Music)

It's amazing to be alive when niggas wants you to die
Mad at every check you deposit, I see it all in their eyes
I'ma stunt harder, I'ma shop more
Black bell boy, Persian rugs at the door
Giving niggas jobs, living like the mob
A scotch in the soda anastasia.com
People talking 'bout me, say I got a body
Or are they mad at me that the house got a lobby?
Big four-fifths spliffs at the boat split
Tip toein' through the city, Alvin Ailey with a brick
Settin' new milestones, gettin' my style on
Down in Coconut Grove where niggas don't smile long
City full of barbarians, wet you like an aquarius
Only beautiful bitches, they tell me the more the merrier
Fascinatin' faces, now it's top jewelers
Pina colada daiquiris Fontaine Bleau on a Tuesday
Got the Desert Eagle up in Fred Segal
Only fat nigga in vintage Moschino
Attempted murder, I refuse to exile
So it's Club LIV til I'm exed out
A gold casket my final request
Bangin' at em like my child they want molest
Therefore I pray I live a hundred years
Be a crutch for my kids all through their wonder years
Oil money fuck up a hundred mill
That's just a yacht and a crib, nigga dying to live
Champagne, spillin' the opulence
Side bitches remain anonymous
Got a condo on Collins, another on Sunny Isle
Makin sure you get around cause these niggas will gun you down
Got my daughter a Fendi purse then I took her to Disney World
All I give her is game, digesting my every word
Tired and chartered a plane, oil money the game
Classics stay on my feet, Double M on my chain
All I think about is oil money
These niggas barely gettin' tour money

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Tryna get a grip, but you just can't clutch it
When the money is in the circle, the squares can't touch it (uh-uh)
Reaping the benefits from the years that we suffered
If they don't know nothin' else they know I'm not to be fucked with (no)
Chillin' on the deck, brainstorming on the check
You don't see the bigger picture, you just see the silhouette (ah)
Keep your ho still 'fore I nail her
Money on my mind while I hold still for the tailor (yeah)
Three man weave, I dump it off to the trailer
If the pack too loud, dump it off with the sealer (uhh)
We pop bottles, have the shots of the tequila
Might see me in something you can't cop from the dealer (hmmm)
Probably gon' rang, Gareth Pugh and Belstaff
Work coming in, I sit on some and sell half
Made it to the top overnight, that's why you fell fast
Best head I got in my life, for a Chanel bag (haha)
This is heaven on earth shit, give me my hell pass (uh)
Niggas tryna copy my style, but they don't sell swag
Nah, vacationing on in the Maldives
Room service come to you on a boat, child, please
Don't get me confused though, cause I'll squeeze

Uhh, I will forever cash in
Oil money mean the wealth's everlasting

Street sweeper clean up the streets like Cascade
They back on the rampage, like Quentin
Shippin' 'em off to San Quentin
Ran wicked with some niggas on the block
Still stickin' on the beam
Gentrification, junkies, and fiends
Workin' later, so I'm sendin' a message off to my queen
If I don't make it out alive, you and I
Is the only thing important to me, in case I die
Message received, she's a blessing indeed
Make sure I put something away for when she carry my seed
For my unborn son, I got a few words left
Be better than me, and everything, on my last dyin' breath, ah
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
She be stayin' up
When I ain't comin' home
Runnin', runnin', runnin' the streets
It's so hard to get sleep
She be stayin' up
I ain't comin' home
Runnin', runnin', runnin' the streets
It's so hard to get sleep5Embed"

Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Welcome to the home of the brave (Maybach Music)
Rozay ugh
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
So self made
I can still count a mill' without a money machine nigga

[Verse 1]
Got on my darkest shades, this man is made
Inherit no riches, Jehovah's my witness
Physical fitness, home economics
In the kitchen digital scales producin' the product
Cut the noose off my neck, black runaway slave
In the coupe with the Tec, it's the home of the brave
They wanna know names, they totin' them thangs
Never wanted the fame, just wanted a Range
I needed some change, mama needed a raise
She stayed in a rage, hated minimum wage
I'm feelin' the same, all these criminals paid
Wearing Bally's and gold, I'm sellin' dope shameless to say
And maybe one day I could put this pain away
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be a d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
[Hook]
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

[Verse 2]
Before I was a fetus, had the genes of a leader
I mean look at my features, educated my teachers
I was callin' them plays, you were still in the bleaches
Boobie gave me the game, change to give me some sneakers
Now I'm roamin' the block, car missin' the top
Meanin' missin' a roof, hope you listenin' y'all
I was dealt a few blows, I felt a few lows
Even shed a few tears, I traveled that road
Went from walkin' on gravel, now I'm ridin' on vogues
50M's in the bank, I get me 200, I'm gone
Still so close to the hood, I'm ashamed to say
All the money in the world can't take this pain away
It's just another story at the campfire
Court side seats with the franchise
I think about my niggas doin' 25
Shinin' bright, who am I for you to criticize?
[Hook]
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, I am shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say

[Verse 3]
I'm smokin' psychedelics, I hustle like a felon
Hottest record label, but still in all I'm chillin'
Not a crack in my voice, this young nigga so poised
First I stack some money, then go to war with them boys
Anybody can get it, hand his mammy some tissue
Better ring the alarm, cause we bringin' them pistols
Have them singin' them songs, speakin' on sensitive issues
These emotional niggas, and most of them killas
They movin' in silence, but they follow your Twitters
These the games that they play, they study your Instagram pictures
See I live by the code that the mafia wrote
When he ran his mouth, me I'd rather smoke
I'd rather listen, he had to ask permission
I had to make a way, I had to act commission
Until this day I'm slain, the commission remains
Net worth over a billion, I'm ashamed to say
[Hook]
Honey, it's shameless
Shameless, what you've done
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Until then I'mma be the d-boy, I'm ashamed to say
Honey, it's shameless

I swear to God, that's on my kids
Every day that I'm alive, I gotta live
For every gangster ever died or did a bid
Where I'm from, when niggas ride, they killin' quick
Flipping bricks, counting money -- so repetitious
Highly decorated gangster, so keep a distance
Swear to God, that's on my kids, better mind your business
Five grand'll get you killed, what's a life sentence?

I'm paranoid cause I'm in the Porsche
In the projects, sitting on a brick of boy
I swear to God, this dick could change your life
So grab your bags, it's time to catch a flight

I never hate on all these pussy niggas
My tax bracket on some other shit
I could put you on that mothership

Spray the driver's side window when the Lincoln park

Salty, we the only niggas eating chips
Gotta separate from all these pussy niggas
You could never hesitate and you's a pussy, nigga
We started off dead broke
Now I got forty million in a fucking yoke
I got four million in my boat
All jokes aside, a few million in my ho
Double M, know the G's, nigga
Or Colombians, sipping mojitos with leaves, nigga

All-black Ghost, all-black Glock
Three new flows, that's off top
All white squares, the city on lock

'Til the day I die, I plan to represent
Hold your heads high, we had a nice run
Let the bankers know we have just begun

Watch, that four door gon' pull up
Watch, them hoes gon' pogo out
Cake my birthday, blow them candles
Baby please don't blow my high
It's a band-aid on your forehead, I got people on my knot
It keep bulging up out my pocket, said release me to the sky
This is big bank talk, bank vault frequent visitors
Swear that money keep a nigga shitting like the chili does
Ol' hot dog tater chip bag ass nigga
No shirt, no shoes, no swag ass nigga
Or get cash ass nigga, put that title by my name

If money make her cum, I keep her busting like a hundred clip

Big bank take little bank, two shakes in the middle with a ball pit
Your arm full, my sharks starvin'

My hands dirty, my face clean
Self made, tryna stay up about them state creams
Work that triple beam, papi call me fuego

­I live just enough for the city so I get by
Money never changed how I felt, would I risk my
Life for a dollar, homie? Nah, I don't think so
Greed breeds jealous, niggas out here wantin' info's
Catch a nigga slippin', put a bullet in his temple
Homie, it's the same rules, money talks, simple
My kinfolk, call it what I'm livin' like the high life
Only if he knew what I had to do to keep my mind right
I, I tell you I got 20/20 hindsight
See it in the distance, hieroglyphics keep the rhymes tight
My mind like, game recognize that
Real recognize real, still .45 strapped
Underneath the white tee, Zimmerman get shot down
Hero, it ain't nothin' but a sandwich, call the cops now
Fuck the police, stop runnin'
White boys terrorize nigga' neighborhoods, gunnin'
Down the innocent, in the beginnin' it's:
""You was doin' 50 in the 35"", the endin' is:
""You fit the description of the subject in this incident
We gon' have to take you downtown for some questionin'""
Damn, a blessin' in disguise if you ask me
I was just about to hit the highway with my last ki
Could it be that maybe God has intervened?
Spared my life like he did so many times in between?
A half a block away from the crime scene
A minute earlier and that was me, think
I've been knowin' Ross since he was Teflon
Same nigga now as back then, nothin' stepped on
Dopeman, dopeman yellin'
Cook it 'til it's rock hard, bag it up, sell it
Aroma so loud, so loud that you can smell it
Death to them niggas gettin' caught go and tellin'

And every time I turn around, y'all got somethin' to say about me
But y'all don't know a damn thing about me
Just what you see, that's what you judge me on

But not for free, that's what the fuck be wrong

I remember us sittin' in the parkin' lot talkin' about gettin' money

Cracks in the wall, standin' in the puddle
Sunny south Florida, a cold motherfucker
Ready for a war, barely wanna talk
Ballys on my nigga as they walkin' back and forth
Makes you wanna hustle, take care of my brothers
Raymond passed away, here's somethin' for his mother
It never is enough, tryna show her that I love him
We were fishin' buddies, breed the dog, split the puppies
Pictures on the wall, bitches we done raw
Niggas gettin' robbed, the only shit that we can solve
We all wanna get it, ball for a minute
Accept collect calls, tell our dawgs that we did it
Plenty money orders, that what uncle Kenny taught us
Keep your face clean when you're out here bendin' corners
Always keep in mind you'll fall in love a thousand times
Regardless what we went through, I'm still right here by your side
Artificial homies, worse than the agents
When you parkin' all your cars, they wanna know the payments
Rose petals drippin' on the casket
Baby boy done grew into a bastard
On that lean, you know I fuck her fantastic
Work white as Rita Ora in that plastic
Took shots, shed tears, that's war
Bust bottles on yachts, stand tall
Catch a case, don't talk, that's raw

Ain't got nothin' to lose, we supportin' the family
Never traffic for fun, only traffic for funds
All I seen is the struggle, it's like I'm trapped in the slums
Workers were barely paid, no water, we barely bathe
There better be better days on the way that's on my daddy grave
I'm pushin' it hard, I'm pushin' it soft
If he pushin' a line, he pushin' for Ross
I waited and waited, I done ran out of patience
They hated and hated, left him slow dancin' with Satan
Fresh in my white tee, Mac-11, swear to God
I bought my first block, broke it down and tore the block apart

You duck your momma house, you set your sister straight

I know you see me in that Phantom whiter than veneers

M-M-M-M-Maybach Music
(Get money, get money)
Girl I think you're special
Strictly presidential (get money), yeah

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
You know the crib on the water now
The Maybach stay watered down
Project niggas givin' orders now
The gold Presidential just to sport around
I'm from the era of fitted caps and rental cars
Dope pushers with ambition and pretty broads
Walkin' on Jewish marble, hand painted the ceilin'
Happy Hanukkah nigga, it's a wonderful feelin'
Got my seats on the wood, playas givin' me dap
Lyor like how I move, Warner right in my lap
I made a few mils, ain't mentionin' Meek
Went and bought a new crib, week of Wale release
Bitches, the king comin', Billie Jean thumpin'
I need to hear the trumpets, meanin' machine gunnin'
I ain't missin' nothin', got her sippin' somethin'
I could ship her somethin', you know that December comin'

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's (get money) who we are, baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green (get money)
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Ugh, may see me leanin' in some new shit
Now it's gold Presidentials for the crew shit
Threesomes, weed crumbs on the cruise ship
I'm a boss have you ass on a news clip
She a dime but she gotta be a cool bitch
Pony tail, red nails, still in school bitch
Needed some cash so she asked me could she move shit
Not a chance, whips got her talkin' foolish
I was skippin' them classes, but I got me a master
I was gifted at math, always counted the fastest
Fishscale made me major profit margins
I'm a prophet stuffin' my pockets, you niggas starvin'
Lord forgive me for my sins, I'm with this pretty bitch
80 grand, rubber band for some silly shit
She on that Alexander Wang
Gold Presidential VS when I change the game

[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's (get money) who we are, baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green (get money)

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Ugh, she wanna roll with a winner now
So I let her roll with the windows down
My nigga's up the road come and get it now
60-40 no we split it up the middle now
Shawty's said the word, I was talkin' that talk
Maybe link up New York, that's awesome as fuck
I never been in love until I heard a beat
She never met a G until she heard of me
3rd floor projects, feel my point of view
Everything is number 2, that's when it come to you
Isabel Marant sneakers 'til the summer through
Fuck you on a yacht is what I wanna do
Ugh! Baby girl got that wet wet
I repeat: wet wet
I'm the boss and I'm on that
(I love you..) white tee, gold Rolex
[Chorus: Elijah Blake]
Girls and green is all you need
When you're a star baby, a star babe
We all dream of royalty
But that's (get money) who we are, baby (get money)
All I ever need is girls and green (get money)

""The Lord as my witness
Lord as my witness, there's not!
There's not a better MC than Rick motherfuckin' Ross
Lord as my witness
And when a nigga says ""Lord as my witness"", a nigga tellin' the truth
You don't lie after you say Lord as my witness
Did you ever hear OJ say ""Lord as my witness?""
No, he ain't go that far, said ""I didn't do it""
He hired Johnnie Cochran but he ain't never say 'Lord as my witness.'""

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
(Maybach Music)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Went to war, beaker scores, they continue to fall
Corner stores, wait up, hold all these wonderful laws
So much violence in the streets, ask the powers that be
Kiss my daughter on the cheek and I'm strapped as we speak
Dirty money get bloody, you still see the gun wounds
But what's funny are the ones that we put the guns to
Fuck 'em all, kill or be killed, it's still a thug rule
Back of class, high on grass, 'til I said, ""Fuck school!""
What's meant to be is meant to be, I rather you than me
Die with pride, forty shells on the murder scene
Rolls Royce, leather stitchin' in the steerin' wheel
Ninth album, Ice Cube, nigga, kill at will
Had to balance, Double M is the imperial
Niggas pay respect, they mail it in an envelope
Fuckin' centerfolds like I still be dealin' dope
Probably would if you're talkin' like fifty or more
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
So creative, co-creator, family the motivator
Project buildings, lot of feelin', karma my codefendant
Pot to piss in, not a ribbon, never forgot a Christmas
Father figure not around, that's such a major difference
I would play with all my homies' gifts
I understood I didn't wanna trip
The lack of didn't tap my confidence
Matter fact that's how I mastered a couple things
Went from not havin', to sheer opulence
Maybach with the drapes like an apartment in it
Whole hood know it, only one that's white on white
Name ringin' like DJ Clue on a Friday night
Just got some real estate out in Dubai
Nation of Islam, they say I might have a few ties
Talkin' tall brothers with the dark shades
Shed light, bringin' niggas out the dark age
Sittin' in the court with a sharp fade
Havin' sentimental thoughts 'bout this Caucasian
Six million in the hole, still feelin' short-changed
Reprimanded by someone who's snortin' cocaine
Fred Hampton was an angel, may his name ring
Crackers wanna kill me for the same thing
Ain't no financial aid out in Notre Dame
Activist sippin' Actavis, time to pour away
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah
Uh, yeah

[Verse 3: Nas]
You know how it is, new levels, new devils
The cheddar breed jealousy at hella speed but it's whatever
Mercedes driver, 85'er, enlightener, collapsable sun visor
The half moon identifies, the son of God, son of man
Son of Sam, young with the blam
Stick or get stuck, get killed to get buck, a blessin' of luck
I love all, test me, trust not
Above all but young niggas address me as such
Like Hannibal Barca, runnin' through Carthage
Panama watches, conquer the nonsense, conquerin' lion
Amun-Ra sun god combined in one, most prolific
You off point like the coke addicted lawyer, Klienfeldt's gun
Tell the waiter bring over that Moscow Mule
Tell them haters get over it, Nas still rules
To money makers and niggas who murk you out
And beat the death penalty on reversal trial, niggas versatile

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years
You'd like to meet, to go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Chorus: Adele]
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Renzel, aka Ricky Rubin
I miss you kissin' my lips, consoling my confidence
Apologies from the heart is something that’s heaven sent
Scars for the flesh, war wounds for the soul
Success is another test and we wanted the highest score
Mother did her job, fundmental love
But it never was enough cause I wanna be a thug
Tears fall all the way to the south of France
Poverty line hang lower than my pants
Invited to the Grammy's but I feel so out of place
After we washed plates and they was always out of steak
That is a sin, I was built to win
Came to win the title, Rozay wavin' in the stands
Academics was a myth, I can always plead the fifth
Or give it to you live, Beethoven on the Fifth
Your favorite films tank, Titanic sank
Aroma of the dank as I'm breathin' through the bank
Black market open for business from the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches
From the poors to the riches

So hello from the other side

To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done

To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Ooooohh, anymore
Ooooohh, anymore

So when my nigga Meek caught his case, I went to visit him
I'm walking up to the jail, all the niggas start repping
Beating on glass, kicking the doors, and shit
So when I walk through the door
The captain tell me, ""You can't come in here""
Okay, cool
Came back two weeks later, I got access
Soon as I got on the cell block
I heard him all the way from down the hallway
My nigga had on yellow Balenciagas, ha ha ha ha

Started off poor with plans to own more
To ridin' under stars, the life we lived for
Dreamin' of things we can't afford
But now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh

I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now, yeah
I bet they say, ""He put his niggas on""
Now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh

Corners wanna check him like Odell Beckham
I could plan a record or just draw the weapon
She know I'm livin' reckless lookin' at my necklace
I'ma blow this .40 on me, you can save the lectures
Homicides rise as the sun falls
Watch your dog die as my gun bark
These helicopters rise for the one in charge
If I sentence you to die, well that's a hundred shots
Judge bangin' like a blood, show a nigga love
Caught him with a kilo so he hit him with a dub
We bulletproof the trucks like the ones in Iraq
Where I'm at, you lock your door and you usin' a latch
Now it's stones on my hands, Roberto Durans
Stood tall in the feds, don't fold on the fam
Tryna point me to the money, no holdin' my hand

Yeah, uh
Poverty stricken, boy, you gotta be kiddin'
Livin' like we hit the lottery, nigga
I been tippin' since Scottie was Pippen, Chad was sippin'
And before I had that bag, I used to bag them bitches
I'm so cocky and I'm confident, all these killers in my ambiance
Say what I want, nobody's stopin' it
Get off my dick, nigga
Where you was at when I could've died for this?
Or die for that? Real nigga, roger that
Said I took a loss but I got it back, woo
Me and all my dogs sell a lot of that food
Talkin' to the law, knowin' that it's not cool
Make me shoot a rapper like my name was Benny Boom
Started out with nothin', now a nigga in a room
Sweepin' rich bitches off they feet like a broom
Double-M G, bitch, you know how we move
Whole lot of choppers, nigga, I could never lose

[Interlude: Anthony Hamilton]
I was amazed
Oh how it turned their heads
I mastered the game
Oh how they raised their hands
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up
We, we're going up, oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors
We, we're going up
We, we're going up (So high)
We, we're going up, oh so high
Like Lamborghini doors (Maybach Music)
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Uh, paintings on the wall, you never know the cost
You bangin' on the boss, the boy'll be a corpse
I'm steppin' through the door, my back against the wall
My pockets fat enough to catch a nigga if I fall
Love to see a pretty bitch rollin' a wood leaf
Phone ringin', smilin' like I got some gold teeth
I caught a bird, jet smarter on the Maltese
I left a chick out in DC out on the NorthEast (Trel!)
Such a feelin', niggas killin' for my poetry (boss)
Tryna go back underground, that's once they notice me (boss)
I'm really not the one you wanna handle funny (never)
At the Grammys, my lil' homie had the hammer on him
You niggas out of style with your weddin' vows
I still be makin' rounds like I'm Kevin Liles (what up)
Time to set a date for trial, we never settle out (bring it)
Them Lamborghini doors, you see me steppin' out

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Started off poor with plans to own more
To ridin' under stars, the life we lived for
Dreamin' of things we can't afford
But now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh
They gon' love me, they gon' love me now
I bet they tell they friends they wanna fuck me now, yeah
I bet they say, ""He put his niggas on""
Now we comin' up like them Lamborghini doors, ooh3Embed"

Nigga, long as you livin' how you wanna live
Niggas gon' talk about you and that's completely fine with me
(Believe that, nigga)
Niggas only salute niggas that's dead, and niggas in prison
(Living legends) I wanna ball though, whoop! (100)

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I got a house on my neck, my Panamera my pet
We bought ringside seats and got a brick I can bet
Money, power, respect, I took your bitch with finesse
Chickens jumping like checkers, but this game is chess
What's at stake is your freedom, niggas paying the price
When the judge drop the mallet, all he said was life
Nigga damn near fainted, barely stare at your wife
Brother took all your clothes, whip, sneakers, and ice
Got me holding my nuts, while I'm rolling the dice
760 new Beamer, got me rolling in white
Very few that you trust, better keep in your sight
Thinking I'm doing wrong, when these niggas ain't right
[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I just scooped me a BM and bought me a Rolls
When I pulled up on niggas, I swear they thought I was Hov
All my mixtapes platinum, niggas thought I was gold
I heard them suckas was hatin', I'm fucking all of they hoes
So I don't blame 'em, no I don't knock 'em
But if they play my dogs, we slay 'em, I'm talkin' pop 'em
Want some attention, hall-of-fame 'em, they talkin' bout us
Acting like bitches 'til we spray 'em, get the coffin out ya
We all about it, ahh! I'm ballin' till my very last breath
I hustle like I'm on my last check
And I ain't even in my bag yet
I wake up in the morning, where the cash at, go!

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
All I see is this money, never hate with your niggas
Better pray to your maker, before you war with the sinner
Ask forgiveness for mine, so I know that I'm good
All them niggas we robbed, trips T-Man took
Talkin' panhandle pimpin, niggas Chevy was lemon
Nigga dressing in linen, bases loaded first inning
Taking over the checks, relocating the tenants
Pulling open your vest, motivation is spinach
I gotta handle my business, I pay my mortgages first
When you cross a super-soaker, I bet your water get burst
Ain't no love on this side, just jealous niggas who ride
Until the day that you die, just hold your head to the sky

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a Benz, just bought me a Rolls
I pay for that pussy, I go shopping for hoes

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Ballin' til my last breath
Uptown, flashy life with my Smith & Wess
Hallways, choppa boys everyday
Spend your Benz, full of hundred B's in your face
My lil nephew was a born killa
Real nigga on the field, killa kill nigga
'Til I showed him how to cook a bird
Killa nigga nigga only if I finna work
Matches up in every town
Puttin' it down, hold it down for my fuckin' rounds
All day gunplay
Everyday rocked out nigga in every way
[Hook: Rick Ross]
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
Just bought me a yacht, I keep me a knot
Still sippin' that syrup, might front you a block
I'm ballin' til my very last breath
I'm ballin' til my very last breath

[Intro: Rick Ross]
What a shame, what a shame
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga
[Hook: French Montana]
This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shame on a nigga who tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Beamer on the Boulevard, everybody know it's me
Bordeaux Polo, smoke a ton of weed
No room for nonsense, you under new ownership
Pullin' niggas' cards, givin' shooters bonuses
Fuck the rumors, now I'm standin' in a room with ya
Face, gut, buck 50, got two pistols
We the Knights of the Templar
Born dopeboy, oh, I should've been stopped
Def Jam see me as a threat now
Hundred mill, any less is a let down
[Hook: French Montana]
This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Full magazine, bitch, shoot for the stars
Snatch a nigga chain just to post it on the blog
Assassinate a name, nigga sprayin' in the dark
Hate you with a passion, but he askin' for a job
Shame on a nigga that tried to run game on a nigga
Pull a pistol, bang on a nigga
Gettin' money while them other boys bitter
I'm an artist and my niggas are the realest
What a shame pussy niggas wear glitter
Put to sleep by the pillowcase killer
Black Benz, black weed, black bottle, nigga
Rich, dirty niggas still mobbin', nigga

[Hook: French Montana]
This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan
This is it, boy
Stackin' money to the sky, gettin' rich, haaaan
Stackin' bricks to the sky, this is it, haaaan
When my dogs gettin' high gettin' rich, haaaan
And a nigga rich, haaaan7Embed"
