I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'
I'm drownin'

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 1: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I'm with all my niggas, I don't go nowhere without 'em
If they don't let us in they might throw shots at the bouncer
Actavis medicine, got it straight from out the doctor's
I'm with RJ but I call him Wayne 'cause he's a shotta
Pick up the ladder, put it in the gun, make the .9 stretch
Niggas with attitude, but we come straight out of Highbridge
I'm gon' make her panties wet when she see the way I flex
I'm gon' win a Grammy, move my family out the projects
We went from chillin' in the projects to makin' projects
We was tryna get to the top, and they tried to stop us
I talk for myself, bitch I don't need no fucking voucher
She looked at my wrist and she looked at a hundred thousand
[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Just bought a brand new chain from Avianne
Nigga with attitude but I ain't from Compton
Lil Kodak, bitch, I'm Polo'd down like Carlton
Sniper Gang, I put a nigga on a carton
I'm the shit I'm fartin', I don't know how to potty
Pull up in a 'Rari, I'm in the Yo like Gotti
A Boogie, I'm goin' Scottie, nigga drop my deposit
I ain't Jamaican, bitch I'm Haitian, but I got them shottas
Harley Davidson every day, I'm ridin' with the chopper
They hatin', I know they don't wanna see a nigga prosper
I ain't doing trims, I'm in the cut like I'm a barber
She call me daddy, but I ain't her motherfucking father

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Wrist so icy, wonder why she like me, bitch I'm drownin'
In water, I just bought a Cuban, dipped it in a fountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'
I just bought a Cuban ring and dipped it in a fountain
Chain so heavy I feel like I'm holdin' up a mountain
Everywhere that I go it's a light show, I'm surrounded
Bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bust down, bitch I'm drownin'

Now I'm saying, ""What's good with you?""
I remember being in the hood with you
I still think about you

[Verse 1]
Fuck all the phony shit
Fuck it, I'm stuck on some doly shit
Had a knife in my back when I wrote this shit
I look back and I laugh when I noticed it
I shoot up and lean back on some Kobe shit
They don't know how to pass on some Kobe shit
Should've listened, my mom always told me this
I was only 13 when she told me this
Watch who you fuck with
And never ever trust a nigga for nothing
Even if you feel like you really love her
Don't ever tell that bitch that you really love her
'Cause that's when she's gon' make you feel like you nothing
And that's when you gon' start to feel like you buggin'
I wish I would've never told you wassup
And I wish I never even told you pull up

[Chorus]
Got me saying, ""What's good with you?""
I remember being in the hood with you
Everything was always understood with you
Girl I even bust a couple juugs with you
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
Said you always gon' be there for me
Now you gone and you just disappeared on me
Can't believe I really thought you cared for me
You was s'posed to be the one that's here with me
I still think about you
Girl I still think about you
[Verse 2]
I hope that I never see you again
I don't wanna put up with it
I don't wanna fuck with it
I'ma just send you this letter whenever I'm done with it
I know you gon' read it
I called you a bitch at the end, I don't know if I mean it
I ain't wanna believe what my niggas was telling me
My nigga I shoulda cheated
And now I feel stupid
I shoulda knew better than this
Wasn't the right way to do it
I should've been choosing the money instead of a bitch
Fuck it cause I'm gettin' to it
Just watch how I do it
I knew I was ready for this
Bitch I'ma focus on music
You love how I do it
I knew I was ready for this

[Verse 3]
But all I can say is you dumb ho, you got me feeling stupid
You got me singing all these love songs
What the fuck am I doing?
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'm going up though, I just hope I don’t lose it
Bitches pickin' and choosin'
But I know what's up tho, I already been through it
We coulda been balling together
Hit up the mall, it's whatever
You know that I started from nothing
Them bitches was fed up
The way you made all of them jealous
You said that you was gon' ride forever and ever
You told me forever and ever
I shoulda known you was lyin'
I shoulda known better
You lied I should’ve knew better

Bitch, I'm really timeless

I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot leave my houses without diamonds
All the faces on my watches, jump out it
Change faces on the watches, now they frownin'
I probably spent the 100 thousand on fly shit
QP spent the 100 thousand on mileage
Bruce Lee kick it with me, I be stylin'
2 seater Bentley and it's topless
And she's topless, naked bitch driver
Papers and fronto wrapped around Sour
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really timeless
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really...

[Refrain]
I cannot waste no time, bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, ""I love you"", I was lyin'
I fuck with you but you was always like a side bitch
Cause I can never put nothin' over grindin'

[Verse 2]
I just left my baby girl a message
I said, I won't be comin' home
Hah, that's a dub, bitch, I'm on the road
Hah, and I need 20 thousand for a show
Hah, I ain't walkin' through your club no more
Hah, But if Lust hit me up I'll go
Hah, SpinKing that's the fuckin' bro
Hah, I fuck it up, I fuck it up some more

Try to run down on me nigga you should knock it off
I ain't get lucky mothafucka
Took a couple loses, yeah
What u sayin'? You ain't really on shit
Got zippers on my jeans like I'm Billy on this
I ain't sippin' no more lean I've been trippin' off it
I've been pissin' codeine and I ain't wit the shits, woah
Rockstar lifestyle, might not make it
Wake up faded still end up drinking
Make-up on my t-shirt, I hate it
R.I.P. t-shirts, I hate it
Fall asleep, wake up still I'm faded
Bubba prolly lost 50 K in vegas
Pour up purple and then make it turn pinkish
Said that I was done with it but I'm still drinkin'

What the fuck, I'm 'posed to fall in love with you?
Bitch, I should've never even fucked with you
Trust issues, that shit made me feel uncomfortable
I should've never made you feel like I was stuck with you
You ever had somebody say that they was down for you?
They made it feel so real like they really down for you
They clown on you every time they turn around on you
They not loyal, they happy, they lookin' down on you
You really jacking, you don't fuck with me
Now I feel like you never kept it a buck with me
You saying I ain't the daddy, that would be luckily
I'm hoping that ain't my baby, that shit gon' fuck with me
You had me looking like a clown, bitch
That other nigga gon' fuck up running his mouth, bitch
How I fuck him up and drown him in a fountain
Leave that little nigga somewhere in the mountains

I never meant for shit to get so fucking comfortable
Your niggas told you they was down for you
But when you fucked up, nigga, they not around for you
They say they with it to ride a hundred thou' for you
They clown on you as soon as they turn around on you
I salute ya, you took my bitch and you scooped her

Wasn't I good to you?
Cardo got wings

Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

[Verse]
I can't make no fucking promises
Lifestyle getting out of control, lifestyle getting ludicrous
I made a milli' in less than a year and I blew that on stupid shit
Typed it in like, ""How to make a milli'"" I used to google it
Savannah just wanted to see me perform
And got hit over stupid shit
I woke up and saw the shit right on my phone
They don't know who the shooter is
You never know, never feel untouchable
I touched your soul, made you feel so comfortable
If I let you go, I would feel so skeptical
Unacceptable but I still gotta let you know
Yeah, that I can't make no fucking promises
I can't make no fucking promises, I can't make no fucking promises
Yeah, lifestyle on the road, sheesh
Used to always want a Rollie, now I want a new two-tone gold Patek
Yeah, we couldn't go to Phillipe's
I had to be on that corner until it was morning
So me and my niggas could eat
I be the one with the sauce, I never thought it was sweet
I got my foot in the door
They never gave me the key, I had to turn to a ki
Even when I was a boy
I was the man in the streets, I was the man with the heat
I was a beast, sheesh
He had her heart, but she tried to give it to me
Damn, but she can't keep no fucking promises
Shit, I'm coming with a lotta money, money comes with a lotta shit
Told Mo, ""Bring the studio to everywhere we go"" and that's a lotta hits
Slo-mo in my videos, when the lights out, all my diamonds hit
Something 'bout blue faces, I like money conversations
Whole lotta 20's that's basic, nigga, fuck it, I'm shameless
Can't fuck with a snitch nigga, if you get caught, don't say shit
Have you ever met another nigga like me? I bet you won't say shit
I went from rags to riches
I bagged the bitches that gave me the straight face
I hit the baddest bitches
It's sad but I had to curve 'em the same day
I treated them bad
I wouldn't be mad if I was to get treated the same way
So treat me the same way, same way, same way
I was a savage to you
I had to give up and put all my hoes to the side
I swear if I ever left you in the cold
It's 'cause it was colder inside
Look here, I swear if you ever try to leave me alone
I hope you don't turn to a thot
Most of the niggas that call me only hit my phone
Because I get money a lot
I be the one with the throne
You say you gon' take it but nigga we know that's a lie
Even before we was on
The money was long and we used to fuck up the spot
Bitches was singing my song
I knew I was on, right when I bust down a watch
Niggas was hating before and they hate on me now
But don't know what to say to me now
I was gonna do it to her, but I don't really wanna use her
Keep giving excuses, when we really gonna link up?
Even if I sound stupid, I'ma say what's real to her
Even if she not truthful, fuck it I'ma still be good to you

Yeah, at least I was good to you
At least I was good to you

Ness on the beat
I'm not a regular person

[Verse 1]
Done with the perkys
I don't even feel like it's working
I was playing the bench, I was lurking
On the block where they plotting on murking
You don't even know I was hurting
I was fucked up, a bitch had me hurting
And I think she did it on purpose
I can't fuck with the hate, I'm allergic
I feel like they had me on standby
See the pain in my damn eyes
I got out of jail and my mans died
I never sleep, I'm a vampire
I'm not a regular person
I can't be giving out verses
I'm making the industry nervous
I'm still working through all the disturbance
I'm done with these Balenciagas
They keep on fucking my socks up
Nothing but foreigns behind us
We used to pull up in the Honda
Now every time that we pop up
We got to pull up in designer
We doing it just to remind us
To never go back to the bottom
They started off hating on me
Everybody debating on me
A nigga wrote a statement on me
My life, they want to take it from me
So I got a .380 on me
It ain't never on safety, I be
Having all of this paper on me
I just hope you praying for me
I can tell you what happened
The streets turned me into a savage
I started off juggin' and trapping
Watch a couple a niggas get blasted
Way too much blood for a napkin
Won't nobody tell you what happened
I'm good when you see me in traffic
Automatic in the Benz 4matic
In the S550 I'm speeding
Nigga you wouldn't believe it
I came up from nothing I mean it
Now I'm living everything I was dreaming
I'm killing, I feel like I'm cheating
They kept on giving me reasons
Can't nobody get in between us
Only us, I put that on everything
[Chorus]
Fuck it up, fuck it up now
My nigga, it's just us now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Fuck around with them fuck 'rounds
Ain't no pounds or ""what's ups"" now
Pretty bitches hit me up now

[Verse 2]
I got on Saint Laurent, come here baby
I just wanted some company baby
I don't want you to feel like I'm playing
Can I fuck you without you complaining?
Got no time for a lunch with you baby
I get bread, what the fuck is you saying?
I get fly on any different occasion
I be in and out of different locations
I can't stop, I put on for this
Swear to god I put on for this
Had to move out my mama's crib
Had to put in overtime for this
I can brag cause I'm confident
I'm the man, ain't no stopping it
I don't got to wait for a shopping list
I want to body a fit then I'm copping it
[Chorus]
I fuck it up, fuck it up now
Every Rollie getting bust down
Young niggas repping uptown
I was down but I'm up now
Ain't no pounds or ""what's ups"" now

Two doors, black on black whip
Told that bitch that I'm from New York, she like my accent
Every time I get a new jawn, she the baddest
All these zippers on my Balmain, I feel like Jackson
Every time she give me good head, I give her backshots
Man that pussy so good, I don't wanna back out
So I gotta strap up, just to blow her back out
When she know I'm 'bout to nut, she don't tell me, ""Back out""
She put her ass out
That's what happened before I passed out
She really got me in my bag now
She got me in my bag now, huh?

You must have been doin' bad with her
She said she only let me hit to get you mad
Oh, it's so sad, nigga

Nobody told me this shit I had to get used to it
Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin', they think I'm losing it

She popped a Perc' and it's workin' so I go through with it
I sip a cup of the lean and then I go through with it
She moanin', screamin' and tell me keep on doin' it
I'm A Boogie, whats goodie, baby I'm true to this
I pulled up in my hoodie so you could know it's me
Ayo that's word to my F, it ain't a ho on me
A nigga talk behind my back, that's a ho to me
A nigga gave me his word and then he told on me
He ain't really hold it down, how it's supposed to be
I should've put him in the ground, how it's supposed to be

Tryna get in my bed to have sex and shit

Wrap your legs around me like we wrestling
Get on your knees don't you be so damn hesitant
When I get your body I'ma be alright
And when I get a 'Rari you can be inside it

And I won't tell nobody all your secrets, I can keep a secret girl

I was hearing rumors, hoping that they wasn't true
You would call my phone thinking it was cool but you knew
Everything that you told me that you wasn't doing
You do girl, it was true girl
Now I got a couple new girls in my new world
Any different type of mood, I can pick and choose girls
Tell me what you wanna do, I can pick you up
In a two door, that's a new sport, come and hop in
All them niggas talking nonsense, they don't want this

Come closer, I needed a little closure
Heart colder, I'm looking over my shoulder
Then I showed her something to make her come over
I put lemons in the jacuzzi, if you see
How I move, we might end up making a movie
Come through, see what I'm talking is really true things
We can do things, girl we can do things
If you wanna do it on the low, we can do it that's cool
But if you fuck it up that's you
I can cut you off in a second if you try to act new
Oh, I'll be throwing up my deuce, yeah

You know I'll never ever forget you
Way too much time spent on strippers
Ain't mean to cut you out the picture
I don't mean to be callin' you ""bitch"" and shit
But I be buggin' off the liquor
The muscle relaxant was workin'
Throwin' it back while she squirtin'
Don't need surgery, you're perfect
Remember when bitches was curvin'
Can't no nigga get you Birkins
Every time you think I'm lurkin'
All my clothes, you were burnin'
Oh that's how you feel? That's the word, yeah
[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie]
Come closer
All I ever needed was some closure
Come closer
All I ever needed was some

[Verse 2: Queen Naija]
You told me that you need some closure, you said come over
I don't need to take no Uber, I drive a Rover
Tryna bribe me with a bag, wait, nigga, hold up
If you ever try to play me, nigga, you's a whole dub, whole dub
Always got what I wanted
Never asked nobody for nothin'
I can take a trip to the islands alone
But if you want it you
Gotta come with somethin' new
I don't know what's wrong with you
So over your petty games, you're getting way too comfortable
Oh-oh, oh
Gettin' real comfortable treatin' me like a regular
Don't bring out the worst in me when I bring out the best in you
Boy, I ain't average
Don't make me turn savage
I need you to see that I'm no regular girl

[Chorus: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Queen Naija]
Come closer (Oh-oh, oh-whoa)
All I ever needed was some closure (Needed some closure)
Come closer
All I ever needed was some closure (All I ever needed was some closure)
[Outro: A Boogie wit da Hoodie & Queen Naija]

Ness on the beat
...the fuck I'm supposed to say?
What the fuck I'm supposed to say? Ayy

[Chorus]
What the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy
Gotta pray a lot, niggas get shot up everyday, ayy
Hold up, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy

Heard you got a big body but a little face, ayy
Got a 41 bezel, it's 100K, ayy
If I feel a way then I'm gon' say it to your face, ayy
If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I just might make 100K, yeah
If they put a price on me, I'll double what they pay, yeah
They say they don't like me, give a fuck 'bout what they say, yeah
I could take your bitch and make you think about what you say, yeah
I'm gon' put her in a leg lock like MMA, yeah
I'm gon' let her give me head twice if she don't say shit
If she ever turn sherm on me then she basic
Couple bitches, had to swerve on 'em, I updated
You pulled up with her, she ain't leave with who she came with
She deserve better, you's a bird, you's a wasteman
Fuck a umbrella, change weather in my spaceship
Diamonds dancing, I'm two-stepping with my bracelet
So, get the fuck up out my face
I'm just on my way to get this money and I'm late, okay
In the strip club, throwing twenties like ""I'll be okay""
100k a day, trap booming like an 808
[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say
I told 'em, ""I got tints because I'm rich"", they said, ""Okay"", ayy

If I play the block today, I'll make 100K, ayy

[Verse 2]
Hold up, talking shit don't ever get to me
When they see me now, they'd better have that same energy
In abandoned houses, in and out, it wasn't shit to me
When you see me now, don't try to act like you remember me
They look at me now, bitch I'm drownin'
And my hoodie Saint Laurent, it's a thousand
And we come straight out the Bronx so we wildin'
Shoutout BK, free Bobby and free Rowdy
Free my nigga V12, holla if you see twelve
Febreze, believe me, it'll cover the weed smell
I probably got three mil', sittin' in my email
So much on me, they second guessin' what we sell
So much money on me, fuck it if it's dirty money
'Cause I earned it, you get murked if you come searchin' for me
When the police pulled me over, I had thirty on me
What the fuck I look like with less than thirty on me, nigga?
[Chorus]
Yeah, what the fuck I'm supposed to say?
Police pull me over, they ain't got nothing to say

Yeah, I loved her too hard, she left me here with this guitar
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you
Now you're gone, I only see you through the phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you leave me alone, I guess you took it to the heart
Yeah, let's go

[Chorus]
It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone
I don't even know where to start, I'm just done
Used to being in my room with you, now you're gone
Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, ""Leave me alone""
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, ""Leave me a—""

[Verse]
Sweat going down to my balls, I'm having withdrawals
It's crazy, baby, all of my scars shaped in hearts
Lamborghini Urus, Ferraris, extra cars
If you start bringing up love, I'm bringing my gun
I never knew I'd make it this far, it feels bizarre
But you know my energy large, like a Quran
And you know I work too hard, I came too far
I'm happy I'm still alive
'Cause half of my niggas they either died or in the system
Then if I ain't start rapping I swear to God I'd have been with them
I baguetteed out my watches, I'm a timeless ass nigga
I was creepin' on the low, yeah, I'm a doggy ass nigga
But I'm an honest nigga, I can only lie when it comes to snitchin'
I hold grudges with my bitches, if you lie I won't forgive you
Just don't go tell nobody about those times that I was with you
You got my shoulder to lean on if you want to cry, fuck a tissue
In and out of love so many fucking times, I don't get it
I could get on some gangsta shit, then turn the vibe sentimental
You say you front on my nigga and he ain't ride, wrong nigga
Swear it's way too many hoes that be dying over bitches (Yeah)
Yeah, let's go
[Chorus]
It's just me and this guitar, playing this song
You can try stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone

Oh, I only see you through a phone now, where did you go?
I should've never told you, ""Leave me alone""
I guess you took it to the heart when I said, ""Leave me a—""

[Outro]
I lost her heart, she left me here with this guitar
So if you plan on stealing my heart, it's already gone
You can tell something is wrong, just leave me alone

I'm just giving you the real
You gotta listen I don't think they hear me
Turn it up 'cause I don't think they hear me

[Verse 1]
I heard loyalty is everything and shit
But where she at? I swear to God
I never seen that bitch
They say they love me, I promise
I don't believe that shit
'Cause they be faking it
Saying it like they mean that shit
I hate that, why you want the truth
If you can't face that
I be keeping that shit a thousand
I give 'em straight facts
Time is money, money is time
And you can't replace that
If everything I tell you is real and how you gon' fake that
And I ain't saying niggas is different
But yeah it's different
And a lot of niggas say they official
Really be bitches
Just keep a small circle if not
Just stay independent 'cause niggas is quick
To switch up and go missing
And they will never go that hard with you
Never go that far with you
How you gon' let a nigga eat
And he ain't starve with you
Prolly break the law with you
Never take the charge with you
Watch you slip up
They will never take the fall with you

[Verse 2]
So now I'm walking in the rain
With my Timbs on stepping over
Puddles full of pain
All my friends gone, some in jail
Other niggas changed like a Drake song
I just feel like nothing was the same
But I'm going and I'm scoring
And I'm just making that shit count
When I gave these niggas chances
They kept turning that shit down
Yeah they say they fucking with me
They just say that shit right now
But when I turn around
They nowhere to be found
And I ain't with the drama (Drama)
I ain't with drama
I know these bitches temporary
When I see 'em I say hi and bye
I don't need 'em I say hi and bye
I say ""as-salamu alaykum""
They gon' tell me Walaikum Salaam

Just because they day one
That don't make 'em A1
Real recognize real, nigga I can't mistake one
I just keep it pushing when I run into a fake one
You know loyalty is everything until my fucking day come
Ain't it crazy how them niggas say they fucking with ya
Grab a pistol, bust it with ya
You go to work, they at ya crib tryna fuck ya sister
The ones close to you will do the most you
If it's bread on ya head I'll bet
They put that toaster to you
They look at you and smile though go half
With you on a bottle
Sip Hennessy and Moscato, I ain't even gon' lie tho
That's word to my nigga Quado
Rest in peace my nigga Quado
They call you bro and then leave you in the cold like Chicago
First they hate you, then they love you
Then they, turn into a snake again
No new niggas, I'll never make that mistake again
They start off real cool, but once you see that they faking it
Take a picture nigga, you might never see they face again

This don't usually happen like this, though, fuck it

I woke up to like ninety-nine missed calls
That's like ninety-nine people I probably pissed off
Like damn, nigga, I was on a jail call
Damn, niggas make me hate my cell phone
Like damn, my nigga, I'm in the studio
Last time I dropped an album was like a year ago
Yeah, you tellin' me you starving, but I been there though
Like growin' up, breakfast, lunch and dinner wasn't cereal
I know what's up
You just wanna be all in the videos and smoke it up
I know you ain't really with the shits but you just throw it up
Pretty bitches in my city litty, they just going up
Nigga, you just wanna be around me 'cause my money up
Heard them goofy niggas tryna line me, they don't want smoke with us
Had to pop an Addy, I was down, yeah, had to focus up
Most my niggas dogs, I hit up bitches that my homies fucked
I hear too much me in niggas' songs, so I had to switch it up, I had to switch it up
Pick out diamonds in particular 'cause I'm just rich as fuck
Rest in peace to that boy Trayvon, I got my hoodie up
They know exactly how we give it up, shoot a bully up
And you bitches know that I cannot waste no time
Bitch, I'm really grindin'
If I ever said, ""I love you"", never mind it
Especially when I feel like you out here thottin'
I threaten you, but I fuck with you, let's be honest
I hide the fact that I love to smoke on exotic
Flowers, I give you all my hours
I fuck around, I miss you though, I promise
Bonnie and Clyde issues, guns around us
No bozos in my circle, they get cut quick
We can't even get around, I got my hoodie on in public
House arrest in Florida, they always checked up on me
So when I was in the studio I said I was in Publix
If you could walk in my shoes, you could walk on water
Percocets like NyQuil, got me buying sawed-offs
Since I been in high school, I been feeling heartless
I swear I was like you, now look at me ballin'
10K on one fit, fly like I departed
Stay with that rocket, ooh, I go J. Harden
Can't tell if I got it, but I stay on it
And they stay frontin', but it ain't nothin'
'Cause I make money, talkin' big money
Mmh, if I go broke, stay away from me
Mmh, if I go broke, I'ma take money, yeah
I might go broke in my late hundreds
It's hard not to talk money 'cause I got money now
And these chains around my neck over two hundred thou
And Puma just gave me a budget, I should say, ""Fuck it""
And give it to the schools 'cause they need it more than I need it now
Swear I paid my dues, I should speak up more though, I'm playin' quiet
Tryna keep it cool like the time I was in the studio with Future and his goons
Sittin' next to my favorite rapper, actin' scared to say it to him
Used to bump ""March Madness,"" poppin' Addys because of you
After you and Drizzy dropped, then I got in tune (Yeah)
Drizzy, that's my broski, I appreciate you too, yeah
First time in the Garden, it was all because of you, yeah
I probably was OD-in' to do a song but I was new, yeah
I can't lie, oh, you was like my idol, ask my crew, yeah
Right when I thought viral was viral, Tekashi blew, yeah
And that's my nigga too, I fuck with you, I swear to God
Type of nigga keep that shit a hundred, cameras off
And I'm the type of nigga you might see in Saint Laurent
Different places, Cleveland, Miami, but I ain't LeBron
With different bitches, denims lookin' like they painted on
Listenin' to ""D.T.B"", yeah, that's our favorite song
I don't trust bitches
But you're just like me, that's why I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
I don't love bitches
Fuck bitches, DTB, no, I don't trust bitches
This your favorite song
When you're home, all alone
Reminiscin' my Dior cologne
No going back, I really took your soul
I know, yeah
Woke up with the chills, oh, oh
Took a pill with my milk, oh, oh
Like it's not a big deal, oh, oh
Free all of my bros, whoa, oh
Free my nigga PeeWee, free my nigga Skills, now
Man, you gotta see me, see how I came up now
Used to wear the same shit, I ain't lookin' like no bum now
I'm a New York nigga, hangin' laces off my Uptowns
Grew up in the jungle where they rumblin' for dust now
Runnin' 'round the BX, RIP to Big Pun, now
And I don't know why
I feel like they wanna take my life
And it's all
[Outro]
Wanna fuck my wife
And these niggas wanna take my life
And it's all
Yeah, it's alright
And it's alright

Woah, if I write (It's JoeFromYO)
If I write you, girl, will you reply? (Go Grizz)
Follow my commands, come on, girl, comply
You only want me 'cause my life's televised
And I can see all them lies in your eyes
But I'm no different, selling dreams for tonight
Just so I could have my way, rubbin' on your thighs
In the morning, go back home because I do not have no ties

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Yeah, but if I (But if I)
If I write you, girl, tell me, would you reply? (Would you reply?)
You know I used to be a thief up in the night (Yeah, yeah)
And you don't want that type of guy in your life
But what if I put on a disguise for the night? (Yeah, yeah)
What if I was to put my life up on the line? (On the line)
Don't pay no mind to them bitches, like a ticket, you're fine
Gave you a shoulder to lean on for when you cry

[Verse 2: Lil Uzi Vert]
Uh, cry for me, for me now
No one can slow me down
I stay with forty rounds
Hit her off a Perc', gave her forty rounds
Woah, I'm far from finished, I'm not done
I keep grabbing on her waist, she tryna run
Put my foot into it 'til she numb
Every time she moan, she be like, ""Uh""
Uh, she switched up for the same dollar
She don't know the rules of the game 'cause she ain't have no father
Me and Artist, yeah, we know some of the same scholars
Me and Artist go home and we got the same problems
And we keep arguing about them same bodies
That's because you is my girl, you is my main body
Take you serious, you know I will not play about it
And if you wanna get better, baby, just pray about it
[Bridge: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
I play about it, but don't you go be fake about it
Just play your part and I won't ever complain about it
Should have called you beautiful more before you changed your body
Then you did your body, girl, yeah, you really changed about it

[Verse 3: Lil Uzi Vert]
It's couples out here that's not eatin', we got plain scallops
And clam chowder, you gon' be raising my damn toddler
And I can't lie, baby girl, it ain't no way around you
Ain't nothin' to say about it, got niggas pull up and spray about it
I'm gone

[Verse 4: A Boogie Wit da Hoodie]
Yeah, and when I say, ""I'm gone""
Don't just say it right after me like it's some sing-along shit
You got mad when I said you could bring your friend along, yeah
I'm gon' fuck you to this, make this one your favorite song
And you even look sexy with no makeup on
And you ain't gotta ask me, girl, just take it off
I knew that you was nasty the way you take it raw
I just hope that you don't think I'm crazy, girl

I hopped in a Bentley, I don't plan on crashing it
I told you that I love you baby, I was gassin' it
Gold blunts rolled up, I ain't mashing it
Before you was my baby baby you was just a friend
And know that I was just in the streets hustlin'
They threw me in the jungle so I started bussin' licks
I ran into a mic and then I said, ""Fuck the shit""
They call me young Mike, 'bout to get the glove and shit
Two diamond rings yea I paid a dub for it
Throw subs at me bet I don't respond to it
I'm countin' up money while you niggas commenting
Stuck on your ex and I can get you over it
VVS on my neck, let's come and see how cold it get
Before I sent you that message I was on my thirtieth sip
I was drinking a Sunkist and then I put the dirty in it

If I can't take it, I'm sorry
I need good vibes, if not, leave me alone

But you look so damn good when you walk away
Do you ever think about stalkin' me

These niggas ain't catching up to us
I swear these niggas need stamina
I broke her heart in a paragraph, turned to a thottie to cure it up
Now that bitch feel so embarrassing
Diamonds be dancing, I blur it up
Your shit is fake, you can't swear to it
I know you fronting, you panicking, I get dressed up like a mannequin
Put on a fit and embarrass 'em, it's so embarrassing
I put this beat on my body list
Metro a beast, yeah, he bodied it, they tried to give me a stylist
I told 'em I'm good, yo, you wylin'
I got sick of wearing Versace, I want red bottoms
Don't let me get in a fight with 'em
One of them spikes and I might hit him
I'm from the jungle, say that you fuck with gorrilas
I know that you niggas be lying
I gotta stay humble, that's why I fuck with the realest
I swear I put that on the Bible
You stuck in your feelings, say I'm fucking on your bitch
And you should've never ever wifed her

I keep a blicky, just in case a nigga with me ain't with me
And I see a enemy, everything litty
Plus my fingers kinda sticky from rolling up that icky icky
Them cookies be hitting
Beam came with the strap, ladder hanging off of that
Yeah I get two attached

But it's some shit that I can't hold back
I heard a nigga from the same block
Is telling on me, I expose rats
Look I don't really want no beef with no niggas
I don't want no enemies or no niggas
The feds is coming, and they sweepin' on niggas
They gained like seven, took like three of my niggas
Ain't no static, it's just defense on niggas
Go black on black, go Hoodie SZN on niggas
Plaques on plaques, I got thirteen of them, nigga
One day I wanna be a king like I'm Jigga
[Chorus]
But I ain't ready for no love yet
All I ever want is drug sex
I'm used to being in the projects
Mama saying I was up next
Learnin' how to fucking rob, yeah
I didn't even touch a gun yet
Most the niggas I grew up with
Are sitting up, or either gone, yeah

[Verse 2]
Gone, yeah
When I'm right, I think I'm wrong, yeah
This is just where I belong, yeah
I'm so used to having fun (Yeah)
I go straight from the Ave to in the club
Catch me right in the back
Cameras on me, they be all on my ass
But Sal in front of me to cover the gas
But don't get too gassed, my life is too fast
Bitches tellin' me to follow them back
Adderall, at least it's better than Xans
Pop a Perc and fuck for hours again
'Cause I don't want no fuckin' love sex
All I want from you is drug sex
Shit you wouldn't do in public
You say you ain't the type to suck dick
You never finished, it was perfect
Your natural titties and your curves, yeah
I make you feel like it was worth it
I can buy you all the Birkins
[Chorus]
But what's next?
I don't want no fuckin' love sex
All I want from you is drug sex
I don't wanna make you up'
I don't wanna see you upset
All I want from you is drug sex
But your love is like a drug, yeah
I can never get enough

[Outro]
Fuck love sex
Can we have drug sex?
Fuck love sex, can we have drug sex?

Nigga don't tell me what you want
Think you calling shots? I make a call, nigga get you gone
Knew that was your girl but she a ho and her pussy soak
Sound like macaroni in a bowl when she mix it up
Knew I was gon' put it in the song
We ain't get to fuck
Think about when you leave her home
Where she really at?
Probably got location on your phone, she know where you at
A lot of niggas hatin' on the boy
Why you really mad?
Is it 'cause I'm really putting on where my city at
Highbridge, nigga from the Bronx where it be gritty at
I be smoking on gorilla glue and smoking GG pack
They don't wanna free my nigga Nun but I know he be back

[Chorus]
Bitches that I hit up in the DM never hit me back
Now they probably all up in my DM, I don't get to check
I could turn your girl into a demon, boy, don't get me mad
Fuck around and threw out all my singles when I heard it clap
Sound like macaroni in a bowl how she getting wet
When I met her said she was a fuckin' bartender, yeah
Then I saw her dancing on a pole, she a stripper, yeah
Macaroni in a bowl, she be mixing, yeah
[Verse 2]
My nigga don't tell me what to do
Mel went to school for shooting hoops and then he learned to shoot
Had to lock myself inside the booth, that's how I kept my cool
Saw my nigga Quado on the news, that's why I kept my tool
Don't you try to tell me nothing, nigga, you don't know me
Done with this bottle, fill me up I need another Rosé
Got to hit a couple hittas up when I'm by my lonely
I think they already know wassup, I don't fuck with phonies
Lately I been running out of time, I need another Rollie
Lately I been on the west-side, don't need no other homies
Diamonds on my pinky finger blinding, all the bitches on me
I look at her and tell her call me, hold up matter fact

Bitches that I hit up in the DM never hit me back
Now they probably all up in my DM, I don't get to check

I put it in a song cause I couldn't fit it all in one message
So I know she gon' get it, I know she gon' get it
I don't put my time into the bitches they be tripping

I know you probably can't sleep, you couldn't lay without me
Oh it's so so sad that you ain't around me
Can't believe I really made a whole tape about you
I made a song just to let you know I think about you
I don't even drink but everyday I drink about you
But, nowadays I don't give a fuck about you
Now I got a baddie sitting up in my coupe
Married to the money motherfucker ""I do""
I'm rocking Buscemi even though I like Loubs
So you gotta use a key to walk in my shoes
They tryna keep up like the fuck do I do

Undress you, don't wanna caress you
Don't wanna tell you I love you if I do not mean it
Them niggas will say that to hit you
I love you, I hate you, I don't want you back now
Go through some things that you cannot take back now
I reach out to people who don't reach me back now
I need you, I need you, it’s too late, I’m mad now

They sendin' shots, I just dodge like I'm in the Matrix
Used to scoop her up in a Uber
Now we taking flights, spending nights in Aruba
I hope we can do a lot of things, fuck the rumors
On the beach, Henny Coladas in the cooler

If you end up heart broken I didn't plan that

If they hate girl, fuck 'em they can stay hating
You can whip the Benzi, let 'em watch us racing and
When they hear me on the radio station
They gon' wish that they was you but I ain't replacing
My bitch so expensive
She listen to me but she never listen
They tried to push me off my pivot but I'm never tripping
She never bitch and love to kick it, Rose sipping
I fuck with you but girl don't get it twisted
It's money over everything so I be getting chicken
I'm hard to get with so they never gon to catch me slipping
Put you on a private jet, fuck a plane ticket

Remember when you used to wear my chain and my bracelets

They only want me 'cause I'm famous
I'm A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie but just call me baby
And I be rollin' with the gangstas
Mask on, gloves on like they contagious

Pull up to a party in a 'Rari 88
Goin' 200 it was me and E3
Pray when I decided I'ma go my own way
She all on my body and she hopin' I stay
I guess that's what happens when you run into the C.R.E.A.M
Cash rules everything around me (Cash rules everything around me)
But even when I'm with a new hoe
I still end up thinkin' 'bout you
Because they just don't know
They don't know me like they really want to
And everywhere I go

Fucked some bitch the other day, I wanted to get even

If I post all of your pictures, can we start over?
If I tell you why I love you, can we start over?
I never meant to leave you heartbroken
If I admit it can we start over
Told you I'm an animal, I was a dog on you
You said I was different but I showed you wrong, don't I?
I still make you wet the bottom of your dome, don't I?
You told me that you don't care, I know you care don't lie
When I hit it from the back you be so scared, don't lie
Pull your hair and I bet I could break the bed on it
The way she gripping on the dick, she broke a nail on it

Couple niggas wasn't real, they switched sides on me
You told me you was my nigga, but you lied to me

But instead I spent a hundred on a new chain
I was about to go and scoop her in a Mulsanne
But she talk about it every time that we do things

Don't you know I'm in my zone I'm in my 2-3
Shout out to my nigga Reggie for these two 3s
I swear my life is like a mother fucking movie
Two cribs, one for me and gang, one for you and me
Two chains, like I'm Tittyboi and they glittery
You a lame to her, now she wanna be my boo thing
Keep the same niggas with me, I don't need a new gang

(It's JoeFromYo)

[Verse 1]
I thought every girl I had was the one, (Uh, huh) but she was not it
Ninety nine percent of bitches be thottin' (Thottin')
If I do the same thing, you'll say I'm not shit (Not shit)
I could do the same thing, you'll leave me cryin' (Cryin')
She got a little deeper through the process (Process)
Still addicted to the streets, can't hide it (Hide it)
Walkin' 'round with two Glizzys in my pocket
Already cocked it, flip a nigga like a socket (Socket)
Nigga, way before the fame we was wildin'
Then they killed my nigga Quado in the projects (Projects)
And it's a shame, all the bitches that was curvin'
I see the same damn names in my comments (Comments)

[Chorus]
She was lookin' O.D. from a side eye
Said she ain't an eater, oh she lied, oh she lied-lied
Woke up to three bitches in my bed
Made me say it three times, ""Oh you fine, oh you fine-fine""
I ain't rockin' with no ho niggas or a bozo
That's a no-no, nigga nah, nah
I know they love my fly
The way I rock Dolce and Gabanna
I lost my niggas to the streets when it coulda been me
It's fucked up, they either dead or doin' fed time
Boy, you all about your bread, so am I
If it's money on your mind, .45 to your hairline
And I keep it by the dresser
That's for any bitch who ever try to break my heart, I won't let ya
Still got blood on my denims
That was all the blood that was in him, no more love in a nigga
[Verse 2]
No more love in a nigga
But I swear her company made me so comfortable
I don't fuck with her (Yeah)
The way she fuck with me
And it's probably 'cause I'm from the X, where they take for respect
Thought I woulda been into the grave on my def
Same fit for a week, now I hate Nike tech
Now I'm a trendsetter from my sweater to my hat
Biggs put me on the big ass purple Puma jet
I'm flexin' more than ever, she like, ""Money make me wet""
And if I die, I'ma die for my respect
Bury me with like a milli' on my neck, ah

[Chorus]
She was lookin' O.D. from a side eye
Said she ain't an eater, but she lie all the time-time
I woke up to three bitches in my bed
Made me say it three times, like, ""You fine, oh you fine-fine""
I ain't rockin' with no ho niggas or a bozo
That's a no-no, nigga nah, nah
I know they love my fly
The way I rock Dolce and Gabanna
I lost my niggas to the streets when it coulda been me
It's fucked up, they either dead or doin' fed time
Boy, you all about your bread, so am I
If it's money on your mind, .45 to your hairline
And I keep it by the dresser
Just in case a bitch ever try to break my heart, I won't let ya
I still got blood on my denims
That was the blood that was in him, no more love in a nigga
[Verse 3]
Run through it, all the bands that a nigga got
I wonder if the streets still care about me
Long story, I can never really talk about it
I'm numb to it, I stand still when I hear shots
Numb to it, I stand still when I hear shots
I hear niggas talkin' 'bout the money that they don't got
I used to be up on the corner with my young akh
Now I go buy a couple pounds of the fronto
I still smoke it by the pound, I get dumb high
I still smoke it by the pound like a rasta
I send money to my niggas sittin' up, yeah
I send money to my daughter, she's a rugrat
I been through it but I'm not givin' up, yeah
I switch up on different cars, now they upset19Embed"

Please do not push me, you think that I'm pussy?
Got too much to lose, nigga, don't make me lose it
I can't be trusting no bitch, is you stupid?
I came with a shooter, he came with a Ruger
I just seen one of my bros on the news
I can't call him no more, he respect why I do it
I'm in the big body Benz with my friends
And it look like we just hit a lick off the jeweler
Look like a dope boy, I hop out a Rolls Royce
They taking my flows like I said they can use it
Dirty Diana, I'm pushing a Phantom
I know that they wanna see me in a Buick
Three different bourbons, we twenty-one deep
You see gang in the shows like they don't know my music
Fuck all the bitches that fronted on me when I didn't have money

Burned Truе Religions, been slumped Balmains

Don't make my niggas feel a way, ain't hurt no one in so long

Kiss me, lick me, hug me, fuck me, while I
Get the Maybach truck, she said, ""It's ugly, but I’ll try""
Tell you, ""I love you"" before I take off, ain't no Wi-Fi

Can I come by, fuck what happened last night
I need good vibes, don't you give me bad vibes
Enemies that turned into my allies
I think I would die before I switched sides

You was my nigga
I wish the best for you even though you want me dead though
Melody need me
She gotta see me on TV, no nigga I can't go
I wasn't with it
I had to get it with niggas that thought I was scared though
Bitches be all on my dick but they never would notice me if I was dead broke
I used to be posted up right on that step with a stick
I was just like a scarecrow
Sosa was with me, he had a strap on him
You woulda thought it was Velcro
I was on 50 when niggas givin' out a buck 50 for damn coats
I had to grip it when they tried to catch me slippin'
Nigga, I was like ""Hell, no""
I move a millie
I keep some gang members with me in every damn show
Up in my city
I keep a heater around 'cause I know how it gets cold
Bitches be tricky
I know that I can never put my trust in a damn hoe

I coulda went plain on the Patek but I had to flood it though
I coulda put S-sides on a Cuban but I'm gettin' money though
I gotta stay to myself
Niggas say that they gon' do shit but nigga I never know
I got a H on my belt and the band don't come with it, I gotta be color though
The VVS's on my chain, VVS's on me lookin' so colorful
VVS's on my ring, VVS's on the plane so colorful
Mike Amiri Billie Jean, red bottoms on the stage
I fuck it up
Drivin' 488s
Used to have to take the train, but fuck it though
Big safe, big face, big Wraith, nothing but big things
Big bank take lil' bank, nigga, but I be in big banks
Young MJ from where the Knicks play
Pull up with six rings
Ice on my arm like my wrist sprained
So many hoes I forget names

It's crazy
I'm still here livin' this lifestyle with the niggas I came with
I always just did what I had to do, I never tried bein' a gangster
My hand on the tooly while I'm on the stage, fuck it, now I gotta play dangerous
To keep it a hundred, I rather the money, I never wanted to be famous
To keep it a hundred, these niggas be buggin', just run up on me if you anxious
And niggas be totin' the grip for no reason and don't even know how to aim it
By the look on your face, I can tell you're in your feelings, trust me, you don't gotta say shit
And I don't even wanna feel how you feel, baby, I wanna be painless
Whatever you wanna do, I'm off of '42 and I do not want no chaser
And you need a nigga that handle your attitude, but I'm a nigga with paper
You probably just love me for my lifestyle, how I pull up in the latest
But I could read you like a book, I just be over here flippin' through pages

Dada, come home
Where are you?
It's me, Melody, pick up the phone
Mmm
Miss you, I love you

And girl, I'ma love you forever, you know this already, you know it's true
And even when I'm gone, I'ma be with you forever, unplugable
Before I even thought about going half on a baby
Girl, even your moms could tell you all about it, baby, I'm crazy
If they ever try to throw shots, I'll dive in front of you
I know I be fuckin' up, baby, but don't you go lookin' for something new
I don't wanna lay up with none of these bitches, I wanna lay up with you
And I ain't no dummy, these bitches be lovin' me 'cause of my revenue
They be tellin' you rumors, spreadin' rumors that was never true, yeah
Only want me to lose 'cause I'm makin' too much to be sweatin' you
And niggas be sellin' records off of hype now, that ain't nothin' new (Yeah)
And my diamonds be goin' off without a light, now, yeah, it's crazy
My diamonds be goin' off without a light now, niggas rockin' fugazi
And everywhere I go, I'm hearin' my style, niggas gon' have to pay me

Turn me up
Jamz turn me up

[Verse]
I know you heard of the boogie man
I am that nigga he woulda been
Hoodie on like I'm the reaper though
17 deep in the sprinter van
I heard they tryna get equal though
I would not let them get even man
She told me she trying to get into it
But I know these bitches be sneaky man
Murder she wrote, murder all she wrote
I can go Boogie or Artist flow
I probably got every car you drove
I probably fucked every broad you know
Bitch if you think I'm a target, no
Want me to take you to Barney`s, no
Run it up see how far we go
Double up but be cautious though
I know they hate seeing me in first class
I'm a young nigga wearing Hermès
I came up from the big x
And came home to a big bag
I'm a big boss and you big mad
Fuck around and die by my respect
I got blood all over my christians
From all my oppositions
Fuck all my oppositions
Like every pair damn loubs now I got blisters
And all of my day ones caught up in the system
If she don't want me then I fuck with her sister
I'm so grimy when it comes to these bitches
I hit her then end up going missing
I'm up now it's no more hard feelings
Its cool I just put her in the friendzey
I just had to put her in a frenzy
I swear they don't wanna see me happy
They just wanna see me in my feelings
Used to be a little nappy nigga now I’m nappy with a couple million
On the come up they was laughing at me
Now they fucking with me cause I'm winning
Now they sayin' that I'm acting different
This shit change you when you really in it
And these days I can't come complain
I still get laid, I swear
I used to not get paid
I'm back to my old ways
Tech hoodie on
No chains
First pair of new Balmains
Had me feeling like Kirko Bangz
I embarrassed all my fly things
Only floor seats at the ball game
I got mad Saint Lauren shit
I told em’ nigga personally call me
Gotta stab bitch niggas in the streets that I ain’t even gotta call B
They be mad hoes after my shows following me to the lobby
I'm a asshole when they come to that
I don't want you bitches to line me
But thats just cause I get it
Been in my bag for a minute
I just flow with it
They all in my business, but
They just do not get it
Got blood on my shoes I'm sinning, yeah
New E.R.D. getting, yeah
A lot of niggas dress just like me
But its alright I already did it, yeah
Niggas wanna rap just like me
But its okay I already did it, yeah
Eliantte got me icy
W's up I'm Winning, yeah
W's up I'm Winning
And I told her that I loved her but I didn't care
And if I expose her
It’s because she told my business, yeah
I’m kinda like Hov I ain't a business man
I’m a businessman
I miss my nigga V-12 and Montana man
Remember back when we was younger
I wish you was with me sitting in this benz
Now when we talk the convos be in lingo cause you in the feds
Got a little hard getting used to all these millions I keep came from minimum wage
Gotta little hard
Talking to you through a phone knowin' that I can’t see your face
Nigga with a wire started fucking with you
Nigga what the fuck did you say
Told you, you ain’t gotta sell grills no more nigga
But you did anyway
I wish they give you bail
You woulda been with me today
Real shit just free all my-(on god)2Embed"

You don't even know how I be thinkin', that shit crazy
Not my broski, no, not my bros, yeah
Let my niggas come home tomorrow

I remember when we was like twelve, we went through hell, yo
Back when niggas was gettin' they Biggies and they Pelles took
Bitches used to curve me, used to swerve me, nigga, now look
They ain't never want me, now they askin' to get they nails done
I know I smell like dope, they gassin' me, tellin' me I smell good
Passin' me the pussy, I passed it to my homie real quick
Audacity to ask me 'bout the bitches that I still fuck
The audacity to ask me 'bout the bitches that I still fuck
Your ass is lookin' fat, them Fashion Nova jeans look real good
I'm glad that I came up 'cause I ain't know where I would end up
The thirty clip is on me but the hoodie cover my extendo
And niggas act so tough
But I just swear they don't wanna start, though
Let me tell you 'bout this young nigga from the Bronx, though
Everybody want his head, but nobody had his heart, though
Robbin' everybody like he don't believe in karma
Somebody told the feds what he did, they lined him
Told 'em where that nigga lived, yeah, they really lined him
He still sleepin' at his crib like fuck it if they find him
Price is on his head 'cause he hit a oppa
Money on his head got him movin' wiser
Hoodie on his head, they wanna pin his poncho
Pulled up to the crib, he livin' wit' his moms though
But they don't even care, they like, ""Hit 'em all up""
His eyes turned red and his fists balled up
Voices in his head sayin', ""Kill them all,"" but
Bullets hittin' glass, goin' through the walls, oh
All he heard was screamin', he feel like his time's up
He ain't have no time to go reach for a glove
He just grabbed the pump, start squeezin' at the door
But then he seen his moms laid out on the floor
He dropped down to his knees, head high to the Lord
Ain't the type to cry, but his mom, he really loved
Tears from his eyes dropped beside of the blood
He wishin' it won't hurt, but he cried 'cause it does
Then he put his own pump right to his mouth

Cartier glasses on
I told you, I want you to see this
I go Danny Phantom on 'em
Touchdown on the weekend
She takin' her panties off
Don't even listen to me
Up off a Adderall
They must've thought I was sleep
Don't worry, I'm back at it, told her look back at it
Throwin' that ass like you mean it
Don't listen to rumors, I know who your jeweler is, I know it's real when I see it
They only be chattin' whenever the story is accurate, I'll leave it up to my savages
I gotta watch every rapper, so I got another eye tatted

[Verse 1]
I do not wanna collaborate, I want a baddie to be on me, baddies on baddies
These niggas be actin suspicious
Got a Richard that cost more than the crib that you live in
Don't say Boogieman in the mirror
Gotta understand money do not make you realer
I just love how them blue faces feel
When it come to love, I don't know who's fake or real anymore
When I was young used to steal
Mom always say she don't know who I am anymore
Montana got caught selling crills
Told him, he don't gotta be in the field anymore
Then I started poppin' these pills
Numbin' up my body, I don't feel pain anymore
And I'm whippin' the double R, with my hoodie on, I don't wanna feel rain anymore
I keep one in the head, it's already loaded
All this water on me, I got holy, holy
You got drip in your closet, you probably stole it
Got a foreign, its new and I hardly drove it
Niggas act like they writin' they shit, talkin' 'bout it's a hit but it ain't 'cause nobody knowin'
Niggas talkin' like they wanted smoke
When they see me in person, they playin', nobody jokin'
I could walk in the spot like I'm broke, and they still gonna fuck 'cause they know that my pockets swollen
Not a killer but nigga don't push me, I stay with a stick, if I got it, it's probably loaded
Every time we go get on a jet, we got luxury luggage, at Louis Vuitton we rollin'
And I told her instead of the headaches, can you give me head? 'Cause these pills ain't no Tylenol
[Chorus]
Cartier glasses on
I told you, I want you to see this

Throwin' that ass like you mean it
I'm done with the rumors, I know who your jeweler is, I know it's real when I see it
They only be chattin' whenever the story is accurate, I'll leave it up to my savages

[Verse 2]
Gotta watch rappers 'cause niggas be movin' so backwards
Like Michael Jackson all day when he moonwalkin'
Don't wait for me to be a holographic on stage, say it while I'm here talkin'
I won't listen to when they say, ""I got you"", anymore, trust me, my nigga, I got it
Don't promise me and say wallahi anymore, I told you that's childish
My chain got me goin' to hockey games when I'm bored, it get that icy
It took a million dollars and a couple foreign cars to get you to like me
Took my heart out my chest and I put it on my arm, and now you got it
You said you wanna take my dick with you back home but I said you wildin'

Counting blue strips with the president face
I got the votes, don't you ever debate

Yeah, yeah we are not looking for friends
So ain't no competitors safe
Yeah, yeah, five in the morning
I'm drinking on dirty, it's never too late
Yeah, yeah, leaving the spot
Had to switch up the whip, they was checking the plates
I'm still a menace
I do what I say and I won't give a fuck if you feel offended
You selling your soul just to get attention
I crept with a pole 'cause I feel the tension
Trappers, they love me, they throw on that Don
They get on that road with a pigeon in it
Little bitch you know me, I'm really the Don
I don't gotta try hard to fit the image
Look at my cup, it's Dirty Diana
I dropped two bananas and shook up the Fanta
Booked in Atlanta
I go to the club with the paper and I throw a book on the dancer
I am the one they was counting out

[Verse 2: DaBaby]
And you know that's all it take to get a nigga smoked and that's a fact
I be nuttin' quick like I'm a virgin, when we fuck, her ass too fat
I had to fly into New Jersey 'cause New York don't like the strap
We make the nigga front us thirty and we ran off with the sack (Nah, keep going, keep going)
Lil' nigga, you asked to get it (Ha)
Bitch, I've been the best since a kid in the neighborhood, wasn't playin' tag with niggas (Let's go)
I used to hit licks in my whip, had to switch up the plates so the tags was different (Yeah, bitch)
And I used to fuck on the sixes and the sevens, now we fuck the baddest bitches (Ten)
I'ma go get the bag, I ain't trippin', I ain't into goin' outside with niggas (Uh, uh)
And I ain't gon' out sad 'bout a bitch, I got hoes on my dick that be tryna harass a nigga (Yeah)
That lil' nigga ain't goin' for shit, they gon' come with them sticks, we gon' pull up and smash on niggas (Bitch)
See the look on my face, think I'm laughin', nigga?
Last nigga to play, know what happened, nigga?

When you step into my bando, you gonna have to light a candle
Window open for the damn smoke
Nigga listen to the damn flow
I don’t think they understand though
They want me dead but I can't go
That was all they ever planned for, Louie V with a Kenzo
If you come to my trap house talking crazy I'ma back out
Nike gloves with a mask out, I couldn't wait to try this Mac out
I'ma be up in this trap house, 'til I count up then I pass out
I don't know what's in my stash now, check me out I'm in my bag now

Keep on thinking I'm pussy, ain't a killer don't push me

Just in case the police book me
Fifty K up in the trap house, hunnid K up in the stash house
China man for the cash out, run it up 'til I max out
What I say up in this trap house
Better stay up in this trap house

I had to practice the come up
I’m on a roof to see the bottom
Yo these niggas be wilding they really losing me
Niggas that was saying they fuck with me was using me
But that was way back when I used to be what I used to be
They took the ladder off of the building
And told us catch up
So I started flipping onions just so I could get my bread up
But now I’m going ham in the building
Cause they ain’t let us
Saying fuck the mozzarella
Cause nigga I wanted cheddar
My heart colder than a case of beers in the freezer
This is how you niggas made me though
Yeah
I ain’t no killer until a motherfucker give me a reason
I ain’t never let em play me though
And the other day
This bitch gon' tell me she love me
Then she said that she hate me
And now she saying i’m ugly
Before she wanted my baby
Niggas say I’m funny and tell me that they made me
But when I start going crazy don’t look at me like I'm crazy nigga
Yeah, don’t look at me like I'm crazy
My nigga moving that white
But don’t look at him like he shady
My nigga move with that Tom Hilfiger
How to go brady ?
And all my niggas gone to the max
B I'm wavy
I ain’t saying I’m a player
But I’m kinda smoove
Shawty gave me head the other day
I wouldn’t lie to you
I’ll show the way her knees and toes go when she riding you
Head, shoulders, knees, and toes, I'll body you
Yeah
They never told me this but cash rules niggas around me
And I noticed it
The Girls, the girls, they love us, I know this shit
But girl you ain’t my only bitch that wanna be my only bitch
I did a couple niggas a favor but they don’t owe me shit
Cross me and I number 2 on em holy shit
Oh well waves on swim
Moby Dick
My heart ten degrees in the summer and that’s how cold it get
Understand it, I'ma get it on my own
And I know that you gon' feel me if you listen to this song
They say words don’t hurt you
But a stick'll break a bone
If they throw me in the jungle
I'ma make that shit my home
And it's coat on the dishes
Pocket full of wishes
Got my heart broke now I ain’t fucking with you bitches
And got my heart broken
Now it’s covered up with stitches is the only way of fixing it
Listen I said many men
Many, many many many men
Want my head I’m just tryna get my bread up
Niggas ain't loyal got me fed up
(I swear these niggas got me fed up)
What about the times we was on the corner flipping quarters
Tryna get a half on sunny days
We was selling waters
Birthdays was the worst days
Used to cop a 50 cent juice from the ocks when we was thirsty
Chose getting money in the worst ways
Robbing, stealing, and selling crack behind project buildings
Mama called us super heros
Nigga yall say villains
Mind telling me to chill but my heart say kill em
So I keep the 9s on me for any nigga that keep they eyes on me
Real eyes, realize, real lies
Niggas lied on me
Switching sides on me
I thought we was cool
Why you want me to die homie?
If they ain’t down to die, why you gon' ride for em?
Niggas wanna kill em and before I would’ve died for em
I don’t fuck with niggas wanna know why
Cause them same old niggas used to say they gon' ride
Nowadays I don't know if niggas love or hate me
What’s the difference between love and hate?
Cause nigga now a days I don't know if niggas love or hate me
Cause nigga now a days I don't know if niggas love or hate me
Cause nigga now a days I don't know if niggas love or hate me2Embed"

You might be better off alone
But she love matching outfits from Saint Laurent
I spoiled her so much, she got sick of wearin' Louis Vuitton
Even when your hair undone and it's tied up, you're fine
All the good girls go bad, nah-nah-nah-nah-nah

[Verse 1]
I cannot miss on one track
Can I have my? I'm just askin' for my nuts back
They been on my dick for so long
I cannot even prolong no more, baby
You was usin' me this whole time
I wore chains that made them go blind
Stay away, I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay
I spent so much time and all this hard work and they started tracin' it up
The money I started makin' started makin' itself
I shoulda did more private investments instead of listenin' to the people that said I wasn't savin' enough
Sayin' it's for a rainy day, put my hoodie on
If I go broke, stay away
But I needed you this whole time
I mean, I needed you this whole time
Huh, you frontеd on what I wanted
I guess I wasn't famous enough
You was half-ass with it
Wouldn't еven get fully naked to fuck, huh?
Your problems was my problems
Just tell me what you want, I might just be the only one you tell
'Cause I'm the only one you know that's makin' enough
And sorry if I'm makin' assumptions
I coulda been around bringin' thousands of hoes instead of makin' love to one bitch
But I, I needed you this whole time
I needed you this whole time
But I'm always makin' you cry
[Chorus]
Yeah, I always end up makin' you cry
This happens every time
We still haven't spoken since last night
We still haven't spoken since last night
I tried lovin' you and myself at the same time
You told me you loved me then I lied
And only said it back so your heart wouldn't break twice

[Verse 2]
Look, okay, I'm rollin', bend it over, make you say my name, like
Cali' rollin', chains swangin' while I'm on the stage
Gave me scoliosis, goin' brazy like I'm Kurt Cobain
See my pockets swollen, all the bitches I know be the same
Like, okay, okay, I know this Rollie hittin', and my chain
Look just like the ocean, you ain't even gotta say a thing
Baby, I be knowin', out in Abu Dhabi, gettin' high
We ain't even 'posed to do this but you know it's only right
Look at the expression on they face
Don't you know it's not okay to hate?
I keep it on me, girl, don't be afraid
I can make them haters go away, baby
I'ma keep that shit right on my waist
My day ones got caught up by the jakes
And I don't wanna make the same mistakes, oh, no, no
Lookin' at lil' bro like, ""Can you tell if I got it on me?""
Pull up, no expression on my face like I'm playin' poker
And I ain't askin' no thottie if she gon' be sleepin' over
And I just hit Eliantte up for this Cuban choker
He took it right out the freezer and look, ""Huh?""
Baby, I am anemic but you made me even colder
Already tried too many times
I took you all around the world just to see you happy
And I still end up makin' you
[Outro]
I always end up makin' you cry
This happens every time
Still haven't spoken since last night
We still haven't spoken since last night
I tried lovin' you and myself at the same time
You told me you loved me and I lied
And said it back so your heart wouldn't break twice
