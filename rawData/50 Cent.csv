[Intro]
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
And we gon' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck, it's not your birthday

[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed

[Verse 1]
When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Uh-huh)
When I roll twenty deep, it's twenty nines in the club (Yeah)
Niggas heard I fuck with Dre, now they wanna show me love
When you sell like Eminem and the hoes, they wanna fuck (Woo)
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: hoes down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey nigga, roll that weed up! (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Uh-huh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, the niggas'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Uh-huh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Woo)
Now Shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Uh-huh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay)
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Rubbed)

[Bridge]
My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, nigga, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah)

[Verse 2]
And you should love it way more than you hate it
Nigga, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Woo)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
You that faggot-ass nigga tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' bitch, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, let the motherfucker burn
If you talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
If niggas hate, then let them hate, and watch the money pile up""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
They know where we fuckin' be
[Chorus]
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug if you into gettin' rubbed (Ha-ha-ha-ha)

[Outro]
Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither, nigga
We in the club all the time, nigga, so pop, pop off, nigga

New York City
You are now rappin'
With 50 Cent
You gotta love it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I just wanna chill and twist the lah
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap ‘cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thuggin'?
Do you believe me when I tell you, you the one I'm lovin'?
Are you mad ‘cause I'm askin' you 21 questions?
Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me? or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?
We only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it take
I love you like a fat kid love cake
You know my style, I say anything to make you smile
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

[Outro: Nate Dogg]
Could you love me in a Bentley?
Could you love me on a bus?
I'll ask 21 questions and they all about us

Man, we gotta go get somethin' to eat
Man, I'm hungry as a motherfucker
Ayo man, damn
What's takin' homie so long, son?
50, calm down, he coming
(*nine gunshots*)
Ahh, ohh! What the fuck?!
Ah, son, pull off, pull off

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
‘Cause I'll come and take your life away

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles
I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, ‘cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""Only God can judge me,"" ‘cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
""Hommo"" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
‘Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
(Ha-ha-ha) I owe you for this one

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source will quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and yo' ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)

[Bridge 1: Eminem]
You've been patiently waitin' to make it through all the hatin'
Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit—spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts to this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats, 'cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50—man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icey
I'm down to sell records but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker

Now, Shorty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her, 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar tryin' to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holla 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid

Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

[Verse 2]
Girl, we could pop some Champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit

She got on Payless; me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas in the summer, they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her, when I'm done I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit, trick

Yeah, in Hollywood they say, ""There's no b'ness like show b'ness""

Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned

Fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver—what's it to ya?

Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready

Motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin'
Up! You’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute
Yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinkin' about just sayin', ""Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!""
‘Cause this is all I know
This is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble
Oh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch)

Maybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers
I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy, now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic
It's sad, it's never gonna end
Now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'
[Chorus: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)52Embed"

I'll have you spendin' all you got (Come on)
Keep goin' until you hit the spot, whoa

You could have it your way, how do you want it?
You gon' back that thing up or should I push up on it?
Temperature risin', okay, let's go to the next level
Dance floor jam-packed, hot as a tea kettle
I'll break it down for you now, baby, it's simple
If you be a nympho, I be a nympho
In the hotel or in the back of the rental
On the beach or in the park, it's whatever you into
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasin' you 'bout how sprung I got you
Wanna show me you could work it, baby? No problem
Get on top, then get to bounce around like a low rider
I'm a seasoned vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat, you could play with the stick
I'm tryin' to explain, baby, the best way I can
I'll melt in your mouth, girl, not in your hand (Ha-ha)

Give it to me, baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride like you in a rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
'Cause I ain't never put it down like this
Soon as I come through the door
She get to pullin' on my zipper
It's like it's a race, who can get undressed quicker
Isn't it ironic, how erotic it is to watch her in thongs?
Had me thinkin' 'bout that ass after I'm gone
I touched the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she whine
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
Long as she ain't stoppin', homie, and I ain't stoppin'
Drippin' wet with sweat, man, it's on and poppin'
All my champagne campaign, bottle after bottle, it's on
And we gon' sip 'til every bubble in every bottle is gone

Catch it coming, gotta keep it on the low
A nigga plug bless a nigga with a whole

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I’m used to the bullshit, it don’t matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So which you want, the cheese or the cheeks
You want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat
I’m havin’ the epiphany you niggas ain’t shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I’m from
I’m a Southside nigga, yeah I’m ‘bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come outline
You ain’t made of what I’m made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch, her shoes come from Bakers
Counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We on now; we pullin’ off the lot
Brake hit the button then we pulling, down the top
Shine’s on stuntin’ and I’m pullin’ out a knot
Strapped with the Glock won’t pull it out a lot but front, I’ll make it pop

Visualize everything I needed and dream (uh-huh)
Penalized every ho nigga that have a scheme (what else?)
Guns in your video get you locked in a bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father when he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and a binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck her or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot

Good pussy for dinner, bomb kush for breakfast
D colored VS stones around my neck bitch
It feels like a nigga dreamin’
Seat back, music bumpin’, niggas leanin’
Bulls eye, that’s what we came for
The bread, now a nigga run the game boy
I should’ve sent the broad to report what’s in the yard
Aloof livin’, I came up so hard
No pain, no gain, it’s embedded in the brain
I’m in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame

‘Round the world tourin’, the city got boring
Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans
Coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange
Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses
Living life with no worries

Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e

Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry

Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes

We say you a wanksta and you need to stop frontin'
You ain't no friend of mine (Yeah!), you ain't no kin of mine (C'mon!)
What makes you think that I won't run up on you with a 9? (Uh-huh)
We do this all the time (What?), right now we on the grind (Yeah)
So hurry up and cop and go, we sellin' nicks and dimes (Uh-huh)
Shorty, she so fine, I gotta make her mine
An ass like that gotta be one of a kind (Woo!)
I crush 'em every time, punch 'em with every line
I'm fuckin' with they mind, I make 'em press rewind
They know they can't shine if I'm around to rhyme
Been on parole since '94 'cause I commit the crime
I send you my line, I did a three-to-nine
The D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin' dimes

Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh
Southside, what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, when you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See, niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
Supreme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
The roll with E-Z Wider, then they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack
I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Gus was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like LA and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks
[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 2]
That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man, I'ma get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Enticed to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but, son, I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asian
Feds couldn't catch him dirty, so settled for tax evasion
[Chorus]
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again
And again (And again and again)

[Verse 3]
Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley
Ronnie Bumps and Chick... shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news you see players in this game that lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Lou, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster
At Benihana's, heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you the MAC will

I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see
The penitentiary is definitely out the question for me
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

[Verse 3]
It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me
Racist, pointing at me, ""Look at Niggaraci"" - hello
[Chorus]
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)
Nigga, you get in my way while I'm trying to get mine
And I'll buck you (Buck you)
I don't care who you run with, or where you from
Nigga, fuck you (Fuck you)
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)35Embed"

They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes they moving seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the ball or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation

I gotta hustle through the hustle and bust while I make a move
Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school
Of hard knocks, shots pop, bodies drop
Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

I'm on the grind, let my paper stack but I'm filthy
It's funny how niggas get to screw-facin' at me
Anyhow they ain't got the heart to get at me
I'll get down, Southside's the hood that I come from
So I don't cruise through nobody hood without my gun
They know the kid ain't gon' fall for all that bullshit
Try and stick me, I'ma let off a full clip
It ain't my fault you done fucked up your re-up
At the dice game, who told you put a G up?
Everybody mad when they paper don't stack right
But when I come around y'all niggas better act right
When we got the tops down, you can hear the systems thump
Nigga, when we rollin', rollin', rollin'
Shut your block down, quick to put a hole in a chump

They come to scoop me up at LAX and I hop in
Now when it comes to bad bitches you know I got them
Some from Long Beach, some from Watts and from Compton
You know a nigga wanna see how Cali girls freak off
After that five hour flight from New York
I start spittin' G at a bitch like a pimp, mane
Tell her, ""Meet me at the Mondrian so we can do our thang.""
She can bring the lingerie with her, I sup-pose
Then we can go from fully dressed to just havin' no clothes
Then she can run and tell her best friend 'bout my sex game
Then her best friend could potentially be next, mane
Listen mane, shit changed, I came up, I'm doin' my thang
Homie, I'm holdin', holdin', holdin'
Oh shit, mane, the store owner watchin' you
Before somethin' get stolen, stolen, stolen

Keep thinking I'm candy 'til ya fucking skull get popped
And ya brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box
In the hood summer time is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying ""Lord, Jesus help me"" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that A.K. come out
You can squeeze ya little handgun till you run out
And you can run for ya backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear ya back up
God's on ya side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me ya fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck ya luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause ya mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart you'd be shook of me

Spray ya mama crib and let yo ass look for me

Behind that twinkle in ya eyes, I can see the bitch in you

So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks

I'm down to ride till the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the 50 grand you put in the hood
But ya shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol I define the definition of pain
If you survive ya bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same

See the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains

Must cease existing, little nigga, now listen

Knowing that you get knocked you get fucked in the yard
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle
I eat ya for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but you can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful cause to me you're a mystery

What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?

[Verse 1]
They say I walk around like I got a S on my chest
Nah, that's a semi-auto, in a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothing, the DA might wanna play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You getting money, I can't get nothin' with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for DWI
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred G's, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)
D's come, we dump the diesel in battery acid
This flow's been mastered, the ice, I flash it
Jux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard
I'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel
Benz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle
[Chorus]
Blood (What?)
What up, cuz? (What?)
What up, blood? (What?)
What up, gangsta?

We don't play that
We don't play that
We don't play that (G-Unit)
We don't play around

[Verse 2]
I sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder
When gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?
When the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder
In December, I'll make your block feel like summer
The rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine
Every chick I fuck with is a dime
I'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own
Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya
I'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches
Industry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us
Stomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas

Keep the dancefloor packed that's without a doubt

[Intro: The Madd Rapper & 50 Cent]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, you know who this is, boy, for real
The art of getting robbed
This is how we do Brooklyn-style, boy, you know what I'm saying?
R.I.P. B.I.G., nigga, R.I.P. P.A.C. 
R.I.P.—Enough of that shit, it's time to O.D. 
Don't take this shit serious, we just bugging the fuck out
One time
But y'all can take it how y'all want it, word

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
The bottom line is: I'm a crook with a deal
If my record don't sell, I'ma rob and steal
You better recognize, nigga, I'm straight from the street
These industry niggas is starting to look like something to eat
I'll snatch Kim and tell Puff, ''You want to see her again?
Dance your ass down to the nearest ATM''
I have dreams of fucking an R&B bitch
But I wake up early and bounce with all her shit
When I apply pressure, son, it ain't even funny
I'm about to stick Bobby for some of that Whitney money
Brian McKnight? I can get that nigga anytime
Have Keith sweating staring down the barrel on my nine
Since these Harlem World niggas seem to all be fam
I put the gun to Cardan, tell him, ""Tell your man""
Mason Betha, haha
Come up off that watch now, I mean, right now
The only excuse for being broke is being in jail
An entertainer can't make bail, he broke as hell
I'd rob O.D.B., but that'd be a waste of time (Yeah)
Probably have to clap him, run and toss the nine
I'd follow Fox in the drop for four blocks
Plotting to jux her for that rock Kurupt copped
What Jigga just sold—like four mil? He got something to live for (Uh-huh)
Don't want a nigga putting four through that Bentley Coupe door
I'll manhandle Case like ""Dope, get on the ground
You ain't with Mary no more, where you getting chips from now?""
I been scheming on Tone and Poke since they found me
Steve know not to wear that platinum shit around me
I'm a klepto, nah, for real, son, I'm sick
I'm 'bout to stick Slick Rick for all that old school shit
Right now, I'm bent, and when I get like this, I don't think
About to make Stevie J take off that tight-ass mink
I'll rob Pun without a gun, snatch his piece and run (Uh-huh)
This nigga weigh four hundred pounds—how he gon' catch me, son? Huh?
[Chorus: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Word)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga? (Tell 'em, son)
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Uh-huh)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'll catch P and Silkk the Shocker right after the Grammys
And Will Smith and Jada ass down in Miami
Run up on Timbaland and Missy with the pound
Like, ""You, give me the cash; you, put the hotdog down""
I figured it out, niggas been robbing Joe before (Uh-huh)
That's why his ass don't wanna be a player no more
My attitude while robbing J.D.? ""Fuck you, pay me!"" (Yeah)
Had Da Brat with em, should've had his gat with him
DMX wanna get down? Well, you tell, homie
I'm on that Treach shit, I do my dirt all by my lonely
I should rob Clue, man, his shit did well
I wanna stick TQ, but his shit ain't sell
I hit the studios, take niggas' jewels and leave (Uh-huh)
Catch Rae, Ghost, and RZA for them funny-ass rings (What)
Tell Sticky give me the cash before I empty three
I'll beat your ass like that white boy on MTV
Canibus wanna battle while I'm sticking him up
Fuck the cab, the coroner's picking 'em up
Heavy tried to hide his shit, ayy, nigga, I saw you
He said, ""Why you robbing me? I got nothing but love for you!""
Caught Juvenile for his Cash Money piece
Told him I want it all; he said, ""Even my gold teeth?""
I caught Blackstreet on a back street in a black Jeep
""One at a time, get out and take off your shine""
Did you ever think that you would be this rich?
Did you ever think that you would have these hits?
Did you ever think that I'd flash the nine?
And walk off with your shit like it's mine?
I'ma keep sticking niggas until I'm living
I'll rob Boyz II Men like I'm Michael Bivins
Catch Tyson for half that cash like Robin Givens (Yeah)
I'm hungry for real, I'm about to stick Mister Cee
That nigga still eating off Big first LP
I had Busta and the whole Flipmode on the floor
He asked me if I had enough—I told him, ""Gimme some more""
If you feeling this? Then wait for the sequel
I gotta get Kirk Franklin for robbing God's people, what!
[Hook: The Madd Rapper]
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Word)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga? (Tell 'em, son)
This ain't serious (Uh-uh)
Being broke can make you delirious (Uh-huh)
So we rob and steal so our ones can be bigger
50 Cent, how it feel to rob an industry nigga?

[Outro: The Madd Rapper]
Yo, yo, for real, son, it's The Madd Rapper, you know what I'm saying?
And for real, you know what I'm saying, niggas just got to get stuck up, yo—that's just how it goes down
It don't matter if you an industry nigga or a regular nigga or a bitch
It really don't matter—if you got it and I need it, I want it
You know what I'm saying? That's just how it go down
50 Cent ain't fucking around
Trackmasters ain't fucking around
Crazy Cat ain't fucking around

Them bitches who don't know me, they wanna blow me
'Cause the shit I floss with be saying a lot for me

[Verse 1]
I came in the rap humble, I don't give a fuck now
I'll serve anybody like niggas who hustle uptown (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Coke price go up, capsules come down
The Ds run in my crib, I'm nowhere to be found
Niggas who hustle for me, they don't even stash tracs
They keep 'em on 'em, right there in they ass crack (Yeah!)
When I don't like a nigga, I don't pretend to
I'll have the paramedics wrapping your fucking head like a Hindu
Look, I ain't going nowhere so get used to me
OG's look at me and see I'm what they used to be
I'm that nigga that sold coke, the nigga that sold dope
The nigga that shot dice, went broke, and sold soap
The thug that pop shit, the thug that pop clips
The thug that went from three and a half to a whole brick
Nigga ain't in his right mind going against me
My pictures painted through words, I make a blind man see (Woo!)

I'm not a marksman while sparking, so I spray random
Not a pretty nigga, but my moms think I'm handsome
I hate to hear ""He say, she say"" shit
Unless he say she said she on my dick
It's no coincidence, niggas who fuck with me get shot up (Blat!)
Do it Cali style, drive by and tear your block up
You soft, duke, you putting up a crazy front
I stay with the Mac 'cause niggas tried to blaze me once
In the hood, they like, ""Damn, 50 really spit it on 'em""
""You heard that shit?"" ""Yeah, 50 really shitted on 'em""

That's why they write about bricks and only dealt with dimes (Yeah!)
Leave it to them, and they say they got a fast car
NASCAR, truck with a crash bar
And TVs in the dash, pa
See 'em in the five with stock rims, I just laugh, pa (Hahaha)
I catch stunts when I ain't trying, I ain't lying
I sip Dom P til I spit up, keep my wrist lit up
Get outta line, I get you hit up (Woo!)
Now if you say my name in your rhyme
You better watch what you say
You get carried away, you can get shot and carried away
Now here's a list of MCs that could kill you in eight bars

I'ma say this shit now and never again

'Til my clip is empty, I'm simply

I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
Too young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama tears got me heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bong cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner, I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier

These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til they shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'ma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'ma back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you martial
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole 'nother side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jell-O 'cause

Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud

[Chorus]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I stay high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)
I'm high all the time (Man, I'm on some hood shit)

[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up, niggas holla, ""Roll up!""
Then I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money
You ain't smoking in my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzos
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man, you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls, Daddy need new shoes
Daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semis
They was just harassing me 'cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris

Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time (I smoke that good shit)

Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high (I be high, I be high)
But I twist that lye, lye-lye-lye

[Verse 2]
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me, tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Now let me show you how to greet me
When you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla ""G-Unit!""
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I could go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne

I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alizé, I don't need shit

[Verse 3]
Now, who you know besides me
Who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines?
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them .380s and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop, ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace, then oh Lord
Have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team, they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga? Go ahead, get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot, so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good

Yeah, it's 50
One shot, one kill, what's the deal
Yeah, what's the deal

[Chorus]
Listen lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, that's when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothin' changed, niggas doin' the same ol' shit
Them new hollow tips in them same ol' clips
In the projects, niggas fuck with the same ol' chicks
And somehow, they still think they game's so sick
Now from the rip, niggas know I'm 'bout my grip
I don't trick, man I barely even feed a bitch
She say I'm stingy, I say, ""I don't need you bitch""
Go 'head leave, see if I chase you, shit!
Tell yo' mammy, I catch her in the streets I'ma get her
She know I'm on parole, why she call police on a nigga?
She just mad, cause a nigga pockets on swole
When she ask to borrow some, I say, ""Hell naw!""
I was tellin' the lil' homies all about this shit
To keep yo' mind on yo' money
And don't trust no bitch
Ke Ke hit high notes, when them pigs came
But her ass kinda fat, so niggas treat her the same
This is real
[Chorus]
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, that's when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

[Verse 2]
Blood stains on my stoop, when Akbar got shot
When homicide outside, nigga I'm not
This the third time them niggas done circled the block
It's money down now, yeah, but damn it's hot
They'll love to catch a nigga, on a direct sale
They say, ""tell us who caught the body, or you goin' to jail""
Look, if you know the drill you stay the fuck outta dodge
And say what's happenin' to the captain
And what's up to the sarge
Fuck bein' in a cage man, that shit for the birds
Charlie drunk, drinkin' wild irish rose on the curb
I know a spot full of niggas tryin' to bet a few bucks
Hopin' they number come out, they can have 'em some luck
Two Ace to the deuce, and stumbled off mad
Lost his re-up money man, that's all he had
Magazine from the store, so he can look at the cars
And do pull ups in the park, on the monkey bars
Mad as fuck
[Chorus]
Lil' homie, when it rains it pours
Hollow tips and talons, when it rains it pours
Get caught in lead showers just because
Niggas ain't playin', when it rains it pours
Niggas get set up, that's when it rains it pours
End up wet up, that's when it rains it pours
It usually, goes down over money and whores
But lil' homie in my hood, when it rains it pours

Have you lusting for it, going crazy, face it

And dance in your lap 'til ou ready to pop

In the fantasy, it's plain to see
Just how it be, her and me
Backstroking, sweat soaking all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch 'til the club close
Watching her do her thing on all fours
Now that—that there should be 'gainst the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like when you're hype and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn, I like the way you move

These niggas wanna shine like me (Me)
Rhyme like me (Me)
They don't walk around with a 9 like me (Me)
They don't want to do it 3 to 9 like me
And ain't strong enough to take 9 like me
Ayo, you think about shittin' on fifty, save it
My songs belong in the Bible with King David's
I teach niggas sign language, that ain’t deaf, son
[click click] you heard that? That mean run
Ask around, I ain't the one you wanna stunt on, pa
Pull through, I throw a fucking cocktail at ya car
From the last shootout I got a dimple on my face
It's nothing, I can go after Mase fan base
Shell hit my jaw, I ain't wait for doc to get it out
Hit my wisdom tooth, I [huck-too] spit it out
I don't smile a lot 'cause ain't nothin' pretty
Got a purple heart for war and I ain't never left the city
Hoes be like ""Fiddy, you so witty""
On the dick like they heard I ghostwrite for P. Diddy
You got fat while we starve, it's my turn
I done felt how the shells burn, I still won't learn
Won't learn

Mama said everything that happened to us, was part of God's plan
So at night when I talk to him I got my gun in my hand
Don't think I'm crazy 'cause I don't fear man
'Cause I fear when I kill a man God won't understand
I got a head full of evil thoughts, am I Satan?
I been could've killt these niggas, I'm still waitin'
In the telly with two whores, Benz with two doors
32 karats in the cross, no flaws
You see me in the hood, I got at least two guns
I carry the Glock, Tony carry my M-1
Hold me down, nigga, OGs tryin' to rock me
D's waiting for my response to lock me
This is my hustle, nigga, don't knock me
You need some shit with a banana clip to try and stop me
I'm the one

[Verse 3]
See, I done been to the Pearly Gates, they sent me back
Good die young, I ain't eligible for that
I shot niggas, I been shot, sold crack in the street
My attitude is gangsta, so I stay in some beef
You wanna get acquainted with me, you wanna know me
From 3 point range with a Glock, I shoot better than Kobe
See a nigga standing next to me, he probably my Co-D
See a bitch getting in my whip, she probably gon' blow me
See the flow is like a .38, it’s special y'all
A country boy tell 'ya ""I’m finna to blow""
I’m more like a pimp than a trick, you know
You see, I’m in this for the paper, but I don’t love the hoes
Niggas broke in the hood worryin' about mines
Grown ass men wearing starter kit shines
You know 'em little pieces with the little stones
Got little clientele fiends call your cell phones
When the gossipin' start, I'm always the topic
You too old for that shit, dawg, won’t you stop it?
Shorty, I've been watching you watching me
Now you tell me what you like more, my watch or me? Ha ha

[Verse 1]
That damn shit is old, don’t be screamin’ “Get at Me Dog”
Have you runnin’ for your life when I match ya part
I get to wavin’ that semi like it’s legal
A lil’ nigga hurt his arm, lettin’ off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol’ black nine
I’ll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol’ chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C’mon on man, you know how I shine
I’m in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns, a 100 clips, why I don’t hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought “Lean Back” was “In da Club”
My shit sold eleven mill’, his shit was a dud
Jada’ don’t fuck with me, if you wanna eat

Yeah homey in New York niggas like your vocals

Banks’ shit, sells; Buck’s shit, sells
Game’s shit, sells; I’m rich as hell
Shyne poppin’ off his mouth from a cell
He don’t want it with me, he in PC
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I’m in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
It’s an emergency, for Michael Jackson see
Looked at a picture and says she looks like me
Kelis said her milkshake bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggas know you, cuz
First thing they say about you is you’s a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I’ll give you what I got

Fuck you catching feelings for? I mean when your ass'll learn?
That pussy community, community

While you be all in her DM, nigga
I be all in that BM with her
You be all in your feelings 'bout it
Like ""when I see him I'mma kill this nigga""
I'm on three-way like, ""you hear this nigga?""
I should take the bitch back and clip the nigga
Pussy make him not pay attention
You punk bitch go with this nigga
I throw bands, bitch, these hoes love me
I fuck a bad bitch 'till she ugly
Put the pussy in recovery
I’m like, ""now what you think of me?""
Niggas goin’ out just to talk to these hoes
Blowin’ big bankrolls on clothes
Now they wonder where the money at
Yeah, the motherfucking money that they had from the re-up gone
I don't do no stalkin'
I don't cuff no hoes, tell a bitch keep walkin'
I don't do much talkin'
Right now I'm flossin', I do this often
Gotta flex on a bitch
Tag team, I got next on a bitch (I got next)
I ain't stressing a bitch
But every now and then I blow a check on a bitch

Nah, nigga, I ain't came for that
We don't talk to no pillows, nigga
We brought all these bitches with us
You act like you got all the hoes
But all I see is niggas with you
She don't like when you pullin' on her
She like me, I'm pullin' up
I act like I don't want her
You act like you can't get enough
That bitch there like dopeboys
If you got money she goin' for it
I drink that hoe, her head so good
She gon' have you there like, ""oh lawd""
All this time you ain't on
I done bought her shit you can't afford
She take pictures with your money
But you tell her she can't do it
All you niggas don't panic
I'm just tryna understand it
I must take these hoes for granted
Or you niggas just so romantic

Now shorty, she in the club, she dancing for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada

She's feeding fools fantasies, they pay her cause they want her
I spit a little G man and my game got her
A hour later have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear saying they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, trying to get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country; think she like me cause I'm from New York?
I ain't that nigga trying to holla cause I want some head
I'm that nigga trying to holla cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed

You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target, Jack (Uh-uh)

Oh, matter of fact, I might be in Detroit ridin' down 8 Mile Road
You know, to one of Em's joints and shit (Ha-ha)

I was innocent then, I ain’t do no wrong
She said, “you mommy little man,” I said, “yep, uh huh”
She was everything to me, when she came, I just lit up
Sunday morning I was so sharp, all did up
It was welfare or hustlin', they killed her for that
The first shot, bullet wound in my back
I’m fucked up, look at my sneakers, I’m fucked up
Now I’m on my own, mommy gone
Sam said, “you a young boy, why your clothes look so old?
You don’t need fish, little nigga, you need a pole
You need no new kicks, you need an O”
Chop that, bag it, get right back at it
That touched me, it hit me in my heart
I’m a hustler, homie, you was giving me my start
I am what I am, Sabrina’s only baby
Practicing in the mirror, pulling out my .380
Oh man, I fucked up nana gonna kill me
Whenever shit can go wrong it always will, see
Seven grams of cocaine, three grams of dope
Saint Mary medallion hanging from my rope
Try to punk me and my gun smoke
Look, I’m outta control, my gun go
Off like it’s legal, call the cops, you need to
Give ‘em my description, I ain’t bullshittin'
My high school sweetheart love didn’t last long
Niggas start flashing that bread and she was gone
That hurt me like the bullet in my calf then
My next girl was a pain in the ass
I got two shots left, in case niggas try to get me
That’s nine shots, we just call it Fifty

Take me to 'em

I'm supposed to die tonight

I'm gonna ride tonight
We rollin', whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm gonna ride tonight
We smokin' (Uh-huh), straight loc'n, lockin' loadin'

This is not new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day, same shit, old MAC, new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue-kissin' my TEC
Go on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin' with son
'Fore we find out where yo bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row, row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel

In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, ""Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
And pray for my downfall,"" I understand it all
But me, I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'ma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's 81 one karat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin' on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
Yeah!

Yeah, let's take 'em back
Uh-huh

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Comin up I was confused, my mommy kissin a girl
Confusion occurs comin up in the cold world
Daddy ain't around, probably out commitin felonies
My favorite rapper used to sing, ""Check check out My Melody""
I wanna live good, so shit I sell dope
For a four finger ring, one of them gold ropes
Nana told me if I passed I'd get a sheepskin coat
If I can move a few packs I'd get the hat, now that'd be dope
Tossed and turned in my sleep that night
Woke up the next mornin, niggas had stole my bike
Different day, same shit, ain't nothin' good in the hood
I'd run away from this bitch and never come back if I could

[Chorus: 50 Cent & The Game]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Verse 2: The Game]
I told Dre from the gate ""I'd carry the heat for ya""
First mixtape song I inherited beef for ya
Gritted my teeth for ya, G-G-G-G for ya
Put Compton on my back when you in need of soldiers
At my last show I threw away my N.W.A. gold
I had the whole crowd yellin ""Free Yayo!""
So niggas better get up outta mine
For I creep and turn your projects into Columbine
And I'm rap's MVP
Don't make me remind y'all what happened in D.C
This nigga ain't Gotti, he pretend
Mad at us cause Ashanti got a new boyfriend
And it seems your lil' rat turned out to be a mouse
This beef shit is for the birds and the birds fly South
Even Young Buck can vouch, when the doubts was out
Who gave the West coast mouth-to-mouth?
Hahaha

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Lloyd Banks]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P

Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
From the beginnin to the end, losers lose, winners win
This is real we ain't got to pretend
The cold world that we in, is full of pressure and pain
I thought it would change, it's stayin' the same

[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
How many of them boys is witcha'
When you had that little TV you had to hit on to get a picture
I'm walking with a snub, cause niggas do a lot of slick talkin
In the club 'til they coughin on the rug
Ain't never had much but a Walkman and a bud
My role model is gone snortin up his drug
Bad enough they want me to choke
My boy just got poked in the throat
Now it's an RIP shirt in my coat
Now I'm speedin, reminiscin
Holdin my weed in, never listen
If I see him I'mma lift 'em
And maybe that'll even the score
But if not, it'll be me on the floor

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top
And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P

And I'm gon' shine homey until my heart stop
Go 'head envy me, I'm rap's M.V.P
And I ain't goin' nowhere, so you can get to know me
[Verse 4: Tony Yayo]
I started out at 15, scared as hell
I took 30 off a pack and made them sales
As a youth, man I used to hustle for loot
With that lil deuce-deuce and my triple fat goose
Sippin Easy Jesus, rockin a leases
My momma whipped me when she found my pieces
I look back on life and thank God I'm blessed
We the best on the planet so forget the rest

[Verse 5: Young Buck]
You know I'm still nice with my cook game
Look man, it's a hood thang; that's why I'm loved in Brook-lyn
I handle mine just like a real nigga should
If I do some time homey, I'm still all good
Let me show you what a thug bout, born to die
I took the bullets outta 50 put 'em in my fo'-five
And I ain't even got my feet wet yet
A seven figure nigga who ain't seen a royalty check

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Young Buck]
Hate it or love it, the underdog's on top

When I'm out in L.A., boy, it's wraps and Swishers

Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit
Now Blood walk to this, now Crips walk to this
Now throw it up, raise it up for that gangsta shit

I'm in my Lambo, maggot, my fo' fo' faggot
Doors lift up, I'm like Go Go Gadget
See the shit I got on, homie, I'd hate too
My Teflon on, boy, my government issue
I'll hit your vertebrae, bullets rip through tissues
Your wife on the futon hugging that Shih Tzu
Homie, you a bitch, you got feminine ways
Heard you got four lips and bleed for seven days
I got fo' fifths and bananas on the K's
And got more whips than a runaway slave
Me and Yayo go back like some high top fades
When I made fifty mill, Em got paid
When I made sixty mill, Dre got paid
When I made eighty mill, Jimmy got paid
I ain't even gotta rap now, life is made
Said I ain't even gotta rap, I'm filthy, mane

(Ha, ha ha ha ha ha, ha, ha ha ha ha ha)

I keep nothing but hundred dollar bills in the bank roll
I got the kind of money that the bank can't hold
Got it off the street movin bundles and O's
Seventy Three Caprice old school when I roll
Breeze pass with the E-Pass, fuck the toll
No more platinum, I'm wearing gold
I'm internationally known as the kid with the flow
That brings enough dough, it's never enough though
Shit I need mo', new shit out the sto'
Baby blue was old, fresh off the flo'
Stashbox by the dashbox in case they want war
Make the purple bring the green in, fuck the law
I'm oh so raw, I'm hot, I'm sure
I'm like the coolest motherfucker around the globe, boy
I set the club on fire I told ya
I'm the general; salute me soldier

She loves me, she loves me not (Yeah)
She loves me not

[Verse 1]
The fiends need me, I ain't around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H, man
When we first met, I thought you'd never doubt me
Now, you tryna leave me, you never live without me
Girl, I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up, put that lighter under that spoon
Now, put that needle to your arm princess, stick it in, relapse
I'm back, bitch—don't ever try that
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart, you dirty bitch, I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen, I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be
[Verse 2]
Baby, you know, on the low, your sister been eyein' me
I'm good-looking, so you know, soon, she be trying me
Heard she bisexual, she fuck with that girl
But boy, oh boy, fucking wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote ""Sexual Healing""
Kurt Cobain—we were good friends; Ozzy Osbourne, too
I be with rock stars—see, you lucky I'm fucking with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See, this is new to you, but to me, this ain't new
I live the lavish life; listen, if the mood is right
Me, you, and your sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong; if you hyper, I make you calm
I'll be your incentive, a reason for you to move forward
Let's make a date, promise me you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell your mama's TV
I love you—love me back; no one said loving me'd be easy

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be (I love you)
[Verse 3]
I got you barefooted on glass, chasing a dove
That monkey on your back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me, bitch, you sit there and listen to 'em
Over and over you hurt me, my love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up; when you down, they got nothing to say
But when you call up, I come running, I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down; they crowned you prom queen
They know 'bout me; behind your back, they call you a fucking fiend
Can we just be alone so I can kiss and hug you?
Push me inside you; no other man can love you like I do
Call me Daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean, real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us; it was carved in a tree
Forever, me and you, baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter; what brought us together was fate
And we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
And to see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

[Hook]
We got a love thing, girl, you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be
We got a love thing, girl you tried to leave me
But you need me, can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing, I can take you higher, girl
Fucking with me, you can be all you can be12Embed"

If I ever said fuck you nigga I meant to
When you come up how I came up, life's not gentle
See that tear in my mama eye, that meant the rent due
I prayed on it, God didn't say nothing back
Saw that cocaine you had, we turned it to crack
Had a couple grams of diesel, we was just tryna make it
A brown sheepskin on, niggas was tryna' take it
You know the kind of drama that come with the leather bomber
Niggas try to jump you gotta stay with the lama
Suckers shit niggas get shot over some nah, nah
If niggas want problems I'm sayin' this no problem
I catch 'em on the late night and dearly depart 'em
[Pre-Chorus: Jeremih]
Look back
Look where we started from

Then it helped me 'cause then I was down to do the dirt
See the knots in my pockets boy, I go the cash route
I see you with your skinny jeans, punk, with your ass out
And I got all kind of money now
Look what you made me
Got a different type of temper, man a nigga get crazy
My A.P. look like I done dipped it in water, hard
Like me when I done dipped in your daughter (GOD!)
From playin' with Hot Wheels to collecting cars
That shit in the duPont REGISTRY's in my yard
Somehow the bullshit shifted

So if a nigga get out of line then nigga get clapped
I got an arsenal, an infantry I'm built for this mentally
That's why I'm the general, I do what they pretend to do
Front on me now, nigga, I'll be the end of you
Forget your enemies and think of what your friends'll do
I drop a bag off, then let a mag off
The Heckler and Koch'll tear half of your ass off
I'm not for the games, I'm not for all the playing
The hollow tips rain when I unleash the pain

Paint a picture with words, you can see when I shine
Put my back on the wall, nigga, watch me go for mine

Try and stick me I'll fill your back with MAC rounds
Ask Preme, nigga, 50 don't back down
I kick it funky like fiends in the crack house
Cross the line, boy, I'ma air ya ass out
Screw your face at me I wanna know what that's 'bout
Nigga I know you ain't mad, I done came up
And if you are, fuck you 'cause I ain't change up

Now tell me have you ever looked off in the distance
And seen a MAC aiming at your head, man?
Before you know it life is flashing, reminiscing
And your body is dripping and full of lead, mane
I done been there, I done copped that
It ain't never been a question, I'm bout that
Don't go there, you get clapped at
And if you plan to fuck around and re-route that
You'll never catch me riding around on these streets
Without a couple metal pieces under my feet
Fully automatic weapons unloaded will unleash
Stash up under the carpet like a can of sea breeze

When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
There's a swagger that you calm but when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought

I'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I'll make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood 'til EMS
Come pick you up, you know you fucked when you get on the stretcher
'Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me
They lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home, get a nine, then commit crime to perfection
It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it

Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hid
In the can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sac with MAC-10s
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetus is falling out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl, I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard, still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
If drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me

And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, be bleeding, wheezing, breathing, he half dead

Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn

Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her - I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
And put her through the wringer and hung her over the wash tub

When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous

I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai

She moan and groan when I get it, she tell me lick it, I did it

Enough to make a nigga go crazy man, do crazy things
We get to talkin' and touchin', we get to lickin' and stickin'
Now, now you know what we doing, when you're around and we missin'
We go through perfect positions, we get it poppin', now listen
Too much pleasure to measure, she got the power to beat it
Make her wanna give it to me in that major way

Turn a quickie into an all-nighter maybe
Your sex drive it match my sex drive

I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful

[Verse 1]
Your daddy fucked your momma then fucked your sister
Then climbed in your bed playing with your shitter
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter of fact, grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick, you know, the one everybody on
You 'gon make me sing ''Murder Was the Case''
Bullets ricochet, *ping ping*, shoot the star off your face
I'm international, I'm never home, mane
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with, mate
Or you gon' make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on, Game, you will never be my equal
Your homies shoot doors, my niggas shoot people
See, me, I'm what you never gon' be
I'm in that tax bracket you never gon' see

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
[Verse 2]
That nigga Buck like Gator, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pimp C
Man, keeping these motherfuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs didn't sell like his CDs
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on them breezies
Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look, I don't give a fuck, nigga, please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, ""50, nah, don't fuck with him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper, now he oh so greedy""
It's funny how they shit on me 'cause them, they need me
See, me, I'm number one, I'm loading up my gun
I catch you and you done, you pussy, nigga, run

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
See, I get so disrespectful
So, so, so disrespectful
[Verse 3]
They say first comes love, then comes marriage
Instead, I got Shaniqua in a baby carriage
Then came the cash, then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill', she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man, I can't even flaunt shit 'cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, damn, even my dad
And I don't even know him, now how the fuck I owe him?
I ain't giving nobody shit, I'ma show them
I gave Game hits, he told me to suck dick
Start screaming ""Westside"" and Dre ain't say shit
Now we just eat off him and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me ""Here's the case""
Enemies stay enemies but friends they change
Niggas go crazy over money, my mane

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful

See, I get so disrespectful

[Verse 1]
I woke up this morning, this is insane
Rich as a motherfucker, and ain't much changed
Open my eyes, no surprise, I'm with a different bitch
Different day, different ass, different tits
Strap under my pillow, I done went legit
I'm not supposed to do this shit, but I forget
The true principles of life are supply and demand
Guess if you never sold dope it's hard to understand
My man got knowledge of self and my back, God
Find out today's mathematics when that Mac go off
My temper volatile, grew up a violent child
Fuck a boy scout, I air your ass out
Nigga, nice chain, dice game, try your luck
Shoot a couple head cracks, leave while you're up
I'm a fly nigga, my denim vintage
Gold medal around my neck like I won the Olympics

[Chorus]
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on
Hold on
[Verse 2]
We want that deluxe apartment in the sky with a clear view
Instead we get the D's in the rear view
We learn to play the game how it's supposed to be played
And so you know, you violate, you supposed to be sprayed
It's not a big deal to me, stay calm
I'll shoot the shit out of a nigga, then call it Barrel Bonds
But, if I don't do this shit myself, bet I'll get it done
Shit on my nigga, you shit on me, we of one
Used to do graffiti, now look we major
Don't make me write my name across your face with a razor
Re-Up, new coke, they say this sample the bomb
This shit can take a two and we cut this bitch with a one
Watch the fiends stand in line for the potency
No lactose involved, pure coca leaf
You can sniff that or cook that to my belief
That money coming in like we run the streets

[Chorus]
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight
Nigga, hold up, hold on
Hold on
These niggas, they watching every dime we make
Hold up, hold on
Hold on
[Verse 3]
This shit go how I said, go when it's time to expand
So say it's over your dead body and that's the plan
You a gangster for real, you ready to ride?
Nigga, you gonna die a bad case of too much pride
Check my DNA, homie I'm a different kind
Hit the speed dial, that quick I'll get ya lined
We don't want your block, just cop your work from us
Those niggas you call allies can't be trust
That Rollie all gold, I got the Midas touch
Sometimes it's hard as hell not to touch stuff
On the phone I heard 'Ya smacked the shit outta a kid
Now Jimmy got life, gonna smack him again
When it's war, it'll be war to the bitter end
If they ever say we lose, I start it again
That sneaky nigga spray that Semi at your momma crib
With a silencer we couldn't even hear that shit

[Chorus]
We came from nothing, now they saying we straight

I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven

[Verse 1]
Some say I'm paranoid, I say I'm careful how I choose my friends
I been to ICU once, I ain't going again
First Z got murked then Roy got murked
And homie still in the hood, why he ain't getting hurt?
I smell something fishy, man, it might be a rat
Damn, niggas switching sides on niggas just like that
You know me, I stay with a bitch on her knees
And give guns away in the hood like it's government cheese
Spray off Suzuki's, eleven hundred cc's
No plate on the back, straight squeezing the MAC
In the hood they identify niggas by they cars
So I switch up whips to stay off the radar
I ain't gotta be around to make shit hot
I'll send Yayo to dump 30 shots on your block
You should spray that TEC, nigga, if I say get it done
I'll make you wet niggas if you 'round me son

I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven

[Verse 2]
When I come through the hood, I don't stop to rap to niggas
Get close enough to smack ya, then clap ya nigga
Pop tried to front so I waved the chrome on his ass
Point blank range I spazzed, pulled a bone on his ass
Two weeks later niggas came through with MACs to lay me down
They sprayed, I played dead and got the fuck off the ground
Out the blue I get a phone call: ""Fifty what up?""
""They sent a bitch at me, I sent the bitch back cut up""
I don't play that pussy shit, I done told you, boy
Front on me you gon' meet one of my soldiers, boy
Cousin Twin shot up his mamma crib, now he in jail
Tripping off flicks of Blu Cantrell, pussy, and black tail
Pop mama moved, but she don't talk to him no mo'
The shells from Twin's fo'-fo' blew the hinge off her door
Without that check every month how she going to pay for the crib?
Man, social service finna come and take them kids

I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I gotta make it to Heaven
I gotta make it to Heaven for going through Hell
I gotta make it to Heaven, I hope I make it to Heaven
[Verse 3]
Lord, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
The courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference
In AA they make you say that
That's the prayer they burn in your head when you  in CASAT
Man, I might talk to you while we up in them pens
But when we come home that don't mean we gon' fucking be friends
The shells pass your head close enough to hear 'em whistle
Thank God they missed you and go grab your pistol
In the hood niggas running 'round acting crazy
Buying little Air Jordans for maybe babies
See it might be his and it might be yours
Because them broads in the projects is straight up whores
Man, it don't take much for you to get in them drawers
You can have them on they back or on all fours
You ain't got to tell me, you feeling this shit
Because I hear what I'm saying, I know I'm killing this shit

Fuck who you're with, niggas'll dump a clip
We by the school yard waiting for you to get your kid
I caught a A1 felony on my last bid
Kept calm, made bond, I'm on that shit
You think my rap shit a gimmick, I ain't seen parole in a minute

Through the windows of your soul, the eyes never lie

30 something and you ain't never open your mouth yet

See him in person, say something, I doubt that
Rather get caught with it than get caught without that
Trying to back peddle and stumble on the curve
You stayin' at the ground, you mumblin' your words
Literally I can see your heart pumpin' through your shirt
Pussy your whole life, you always been a bird
Scared for so long it's all up in your nerves
Screw 9-1-1, you probably call up the reserves
And I'm killin' you first, if we ever do a purge
And you know what it is, kid, whenever we emerge
And I'm tragical, traumatical, no match, incompatible
Nigga, you vaginal

Money for bail, money to bail
Dead or in jail, Heaven or Hell
FEDs on my coat tail, snitches given court tales
Kept fate when all hope fail
Niggas rattin', all they missin' is the tail like Mickey Mouse
Call me Mickey Mantle when I bat you in the mouth
I bring them hammers out, we ain't trying to build a house
Niggas on them songs rappin' shit they ain't about
I'm from the N-O, we don't scrap, we bang it out
Bang, I'm the one that came in your house for the chickens
Left a nigga brains hangin' out like we chillin'
Stankin' like shipments, over my shillings
Up your security, Rida gang in the building

(Its 50) And Trigga, yeah

[Break: Trey Songz]
Somebody pull the fire alarm, girl, where you from?
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke
All they smell is smoke, girl, they yellin' smoke
All they smell is smoke
The way your body roll, I'ma lose control
'Cause you got this club on fire and outside I bet all they smell is smoke
All they smell is smoke, girl, they yellin' smoke

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Come on
Pink diamonds, pink sand, beaches Aruba
Blue sapphires on days when she feelin' Hoover
She hood and in the mood when I'm in the mood
Erotic, so exotic, I'm psychotic about it
I don't want forever, I just wanna taste her love sample
That product, I bet a nigga tongue go numb
She's a narcotic, that bomb shit burnin', we smokin'
My old flame, my Mary Jane, we got a love thing
She ain't jealous, I keep Nina around
In the small of my back in case some shit go down
Right under my Hermes, I'm hearin' the word is
Me, I'm a P.I.M.P
I let Trey hit some, then Dre hit some
Then pass it to the homies 'til we all get done
Niggas can't comprehend what this shit 'bout
Police comin', you like, put this shit out

Shawty hot, she full blown, she hot now
100 degrees, that's with or without the top down
But when she get to workin' her hips, you know the temperature rise
Oh Lord, soon as she see the dick in her thighs
She like the stones in my cross, she flawless
I'm thinkin' damn, why would God give one woman all this?
You know I got the kind of conversation that make her feel like she need me
It's complicated, my occupation, pimpin' ain't easy
Facts, I stack racks on racks and racks
Back when I was pumpin' crack, now my cards are black
Nigga get on my level, bark with the big dogs
If I want it I buy it, I don't care what this shit costs
Luther said it: a house is not a home without her
I had 'em panties on the Greyhound filled up with powder
But what she showed what she'll do for me has no limits
Her wantin' is temporary 'cause for sure she gon' get it, wassup

I'm a straight gorilla with it, cold-hearted killer with it
Any nigga gettin' outta line can get it (Yeah)
I make it hot, motherfuckers freeze up when I come through
Mac-10, 32-shot clip in my snorkel (Uh-huh)
I might smile and say, ""What's up?"" but I don't fuck with you niggas
My rap money slow up, I'll run up on you niggas (Woo)
I'm on the edge, I'm just waiting on a nigga to push me
Put my hand on my strap—what you looking at, pussy?
We ain't buddies, we ain't partners and we damn sure ain't friends
So much chrome on my Benz, you see your face in my rims
If your bitch wanna roll, I'ma let her get in
I don't play, but I'm a playa 'til the motherfucking end

[Chorus]
I got no pickup lines, I stay on the grind (Uh-huh)
I tell the hoes all the time, bitch, get in my car (Bitch, get in)

I ain't stunting these hoes, man, I'm 'bout my paper
If your bitch really 'bout it, nigga, I'm gon' take her
Backseat of my Jeep, fuck 'til I fuck up her makeup (Uh-huh)
Take her to the Diamond District, introduce her to Jacob (Woo)
Tell her if she like me, she should keep me icy
My game fuck with a bitch brain 'til she think she wifey (Yeah)
Spent her life savings in a day, 'cause she likes me
Committment from me, uhh... nah, not likely
Went out Vivica, I thought I was onto something
But then the next week, nah, man, it was nothing (Hahaha)

Look into the windows of my soul, the eyes never lie (Uh-huh)
They blood shot red, it's ganja in my system, I'm high
First it's pain when you lust for love; then, it's smooth and calm
Feel the rush, like a needle's in your arm (Uh-huh)
It's a cold world, baby girl, loving me is not enough
Find out when you fucking broke, love won't get you on the bus (Yeah)
Man, you should see the pretty bitches that be sexing me
They suck cock; to make 'em hot, I just let 'em stand next to me (Woo)
Hundred percent thug, freak, too, I'll taste your love
69's the position, your mouth's full, baby, huh?
My conversation's so deep, I get in your head
Next thing you know, you yawning, turning over, and I'm in your bed

When I pull up out front, you see the Benz on dubs (Huh-uh)
When I roll twenty deep it's always drama in the club (Yeah!)
Now that I roll with Dre everybody show me love
When you sell like Eminem you get plenty of groupie love
Look homie, ain't nothin' changed: pros down, G's up
I see Xzibit in the cut, hey man, roll them trees up (Roll it!)
If you watch how I move, you'll mistake me for a player or pimp
Been hit with a few shells, but I don't walk with a limp (I'm aight)
In the hood in L.A. they sayin', ""50, you hot"" (Huh-uh)
They like me, I want 'em to love me like they love Pac
But holla in New York, fo' sho' they'll tell you I'm loco (Yeah!)
And the plan is to put the rap game in a chokehold (Huh-uh)
I'm fully focused, man, my money on my mind
Got a mil' out the deal and I'm still on the grind (Whoo!)
Now Shorty said she feelin' my style, she feelin' my flow (Huh-uh)
Her girlfriend with her, they bi and they ready to go (Okay!)

My flow, my show brought me the dough
That bought me all my fancy things
My crib, my cars, my clothes, my jewels
Look, homie, I done came up and I ain't changed (What? What? Yeah!)

And you should love it way more than you hate it
Oh, you mad? I thought that you'd be happy I made it (Whoo!)
I'm that cat by the bar toastin' to the good life
Moved out the hood, now you tryin' to pull me back, right?
When my joint get to pumpin' in the club, it's on
I wink my eye at yo' chick, if she smiles, she gone
If the roof on fire, man, just let it burn
They talkin' about money, homie, I ain't concerned
I'ma tell you what Banks told me:
""Cuz, go 'head, switch the style up
And if they hate, then let 'em hate, and watch the money pile up.""
Or we can go upside your head with a bottle of bub'
Come on, they know where we be (Whoo!)

Niggas screw they face up at me
On some real shit son they don’t want beef
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain’t a shell left in my heat
Y’all niggas better lay down, yeah, I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain’t gon’ make it
You niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
I’m from Southside motherfucker, where them gats explode
If you feel like you’re on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I wanna fuck
Gimme a second I’mma holla, I’mma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk

[Chorus]
In my hood niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood a little ’dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act
In my hood niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood
[Verse 2]
I don’t trust a muh’fuckin soul
When the D’s come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I’m from it ain’t safe to have more than a eighth
Niggas’ll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo’ case
Co-operate, or Doc’ll have to operate
Niggas I’ll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggas’ll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas are lurking, you’ll have to catch ’em and merk ’em
I’m observant in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing
Shots forfeit the dice game, all you see is the running
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I’m a hustler, how the fuck I’m ’sposed to eat when it’s hot?

[Chorus]
In my hood niggas got love for me
But I don’t go nowhere without my strap
In my hood a little ’dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don’t know how to act

In my hood niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back

[Verse 3]
The house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that’s what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggas where I’m from don’t wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain’t good to do good in my hood
*Click-clack, blam* You know not to do good now

The hoodrats they say ""He so crazy""
The snitches they say ""He tried to spray me""
But that's what you get for trying to play me
The aftermath of my wrath is so shady
No matter how you try, you can't stop this
I catch ya stunting in the Bentley Coupé cockpit
If you a pimp why ya hoes stay outta pocket?
Front and find out how my P-40 Glock hit
""50, you need some help?"" Chill, Yayo, I got this

Rule number one: Don't go against the grain
Rule number two: Give respect where respect due
Rule number three: If you get knocked, play games and say names
The .45 will tear you out the frame
It's like the rich get richer and the poor don't get a fucking thing
For me ain't nothin' changed, but the things my money bring
My style will leave you aggy like them cats in jail
Who peoples got plenty money, actin' like they ain't got bail
I feel for you niggas, gettin' shot while I'm sayin' this rhyme
Or niggas in the mess hall, gettin' chopped on chow lines
An old timer schooled me, said: ""Don't burn bridges, my friend
Imagine the G-Dub close and yo' ass gotta swim""
I watch the fifth melt a nigga on the sidewalk in New York
Me and shorty stood from afar and had a talk
He said ""I told him if he came around I'd clap him, I gave him my word
Look at his hand, it's still shakin' - he had a lot of nerve""

[Hook]
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack

If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack

Yo, when the Feds come in the game, loyalty is limited
Hardcore niggas start actin' feminine
With the Feds you do eighty five percent of your time
Duke, you get ten, you'll damn near do nine
I hate a liar more than I hate thief
A thief is only after my salary, a liar is after my reality
The streets I know'em like my ABC's
Stay away from the D's and stack ya' cheese
Try to see three hundred G's before you see 300Z's
Tree top to feel the breeze, coke connects for key's
Yo' bitches sexin' me, take me to ecstacy
Once I nut, I don't want 'em next to me
If it's on, mother fucker, believe I'mma ride
I'm the type to swallow my blood 'fore I swallow my pride
Letters on my sweater read DKNY
Got grimy niggas runnin' with me from BKNY

[Hook]
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler
[Verse 3]
They say I don't sound like a killer, well, how a killer sound?
I bet I grab a 4-pound and back that ass down
See many men live, baby, and many men die
Many men get drunk, puff lye and stay high
Here's a jewel: love your enemies and hate your friends
Your enemies remain the same, friends always change
I learned quick that there's more than one way to skin a cat
You can get 'em in his face, dog, or down his back
All bullshit aside now, its time to be honest
I fear no man, for death is all that's promised
I got niggas standin' in line, waitin' to hear me spit
From '86 to '96 the game went from sugar to shit
This for you niggas in the background dyin' to shine
I hate you like fiends that ask me for a dime for nine
Ain't nothin' changed in the game, but faces and names
The state, the weight, the date and the jake

[Hook]
If it wasn't for the flow
I'd probably have to double back, bubble crack
I'm a hustler

Look at this stack, I got money, I got money!

Aw nigga don't trip, I'll kill you if you fuck with my grip
I won't hesitate to let off a clip
Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' make me get on some shit
Run up on you quick, wet up your whip
Aw nigga don't trip, you gon' get your monkey-ass hit
Runnin your lip, tryin to fuck with my clique
Aw nigga don't trip, in case you didn't know who this is
It's 50 Cent bitch, G-Unit
Aw nigga don't trip

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I come through your hood, stunting in my yellow Lam'
Murcielago, top down, nigga damn
I'm the biggest crook from New York since Son of Sam
Cruising, bumping Buck's shit, Ruger in my hand
Thinking the East ain't enough, it's time to expand
I plan to head out West and plant my feet down
A nigga big as King Kong in the street now
I do a little house shopping, and buy me a crib
It's palm trees and pretty bitches out in Cali kid
I touch the Hollywood paper, go and shoot me some flicks
Have some supermodel bitches come and suck on some dick
Mama'd turn in her grave if I married a white chick
But Becky'll suck the chrome off a Chevy and shit
Niggas be wearing fake shines, I'm rocking a lil' charm
30 carats on the pinky, kiss the ring on the Don
Crack open that Cali bud, stuff the weed in the palm
[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nigga you hustle, but me I'll hustle harder
I got what you need; them trees, that hard, that powder
My niggas move G-packs, every hour on the hour
They shoot when I say shoot, so I'm in a position of power
You fuck around if you wanna

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Where I'm from you learn to blend in or get touched
I don't need niggas for support, I don't walk with a crutch
Niggas know my steez, they don't fuck with me son
You got a appetite for hollow-tips, I feed you my gun
This is that Ferrari F-50 shit, it's real laid back
Type shit you recline to in the Maybachs
I got two shooters now on the run from the fuzz
You get the same shit for ten bodies you get from one cuz
I live life in the fast lane; hundred miles an hour
Chrome and some wood grain
You know a nigga still really tryin to move 'caine
Make a little extra money on the side mayne, I ain't playing
I'm up early with the birds, word, putting that work in
Pirellis on the Porsche chirping, I'm making moves
I got a hundred mil from music, a hundred grand from crack
Gonna see my jeweler so I can blow a stack

[Hook: 50 Cent]

But you can't convince me the Lord don't love me
When my CD's drop, they sell the best
You call it luck, why can't it just be I'm blessed
I'm a track star runnin' through life chasin' my dreams
Best deal I made was tradin' the mic for that triple beam
I zone off thinkin' is there really heaven or hell
If so what happens to a changed man that dies in a cell?
I need no answers to these questions, 'cause time will tell
Got a date with destiny, she's more than a girl
Don't much good come from me, but my music
It's a gift given from God, so I'ma use it - yeah

Some days I'm in the crowd, all by myself
Bunch of niggas around, I'm still by myself
I drift off on a cloud, by myself
Thinkin 'bout nothin more, than life - what else?
These days it's hard to tell who really cares for me
So when you hear this song, you should say a prayer for me
I put a message in my music, hope it brightens your day
If times are hard when you hear it, know you'll be okay
A O.G. told me God's favorites have a hard time
You're out the hood, that's good, now stay on the grind
I'm a sponge, knowledge, and wisdom I ab-sorb fast
I'm in a class by myself, you do the math

Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas go through changes
I love to see niggas shoot the shit
But there's one thing about niggas I do not love

[Notorious B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn
To all my Uptown
To all my Bronx
To all my Queensbridge

[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rip it quick
And kicks it quick - you know how black niggas get
With them hoods, fatigues; with the boots with trees
Smoking weed, flipping keys, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm bagging you, huh
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make them wet in their pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga
[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel us nigga
Biggie yo' nigga, 50 yo' nigga
Squeeze the trigger, leave a nigga fo' sho'!

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
Yo, we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetery, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya'
Get mad do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A., because fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North bound first stop, Watertown or Fishscale
Where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-ha, yo chief, pass the buddha

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand in hand
Even my P.O., she called me ""the Ginger Bread Man""
I catch a new case, and tell her ass: ""Catch me if you can""
Don't let your people fill you up with octane, I'm not playing
Get gassed up, to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it: thou shalt not fuck with, nor see Poppa
50 Cent, I'll break yo' punk ass off proper
There's no place like home, New York! New York!
I run this city, and I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they're smacked silly
Or sprayed with the MAC milli, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard, lip syncing my lyrics, like Milli Vanilli
In the hood they feel me {*Gun cock*} ha! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit {*Gunshot*}
Every bootlegger you know, pump my shit - bitch!

I'm exhausted, last night I lost it
Let the homies get loose, I'm sure I'ma get the lawsuit
Nana called, my granddaddy coughing up blood
Got an infection, the cycle of life just sucks
I bet when he die, she die, just because
They been together 60 years, that's what they call love
Paid for my first cousin wedding, over 200 grand
Then two kids and six years later, he's the wrong man
I woke up this morning, really wasn't feeling myself
Thought about suicide but me, I ain't killing myself
My cousin Dory shot his girlfriend then shot himself in the head
Before I shoot myself, I'm shooting everyone else kid
My head aching, my hands shaking, I'm sweating bullets
And it ain't even hot in this bitch, I'm going through it
My mind playing tricks on me, I mean, shit homie
I might need a straitjacket fit for me

My favorite uncle Roc got twisted 'til that liquor gave him sugar
Had complications once or twice, that shit fucked up his liver
To me he’s still the man cause see me I still remember
That lil’ snorkel he bought me to stay warm that December
I was sleeping in the basement, the window had a draft
Even with the electric heater, I was freezing my ass
I got some money now so if I die before him, I'ma leave it to him
He can have a fine nurse put that insulin needle to him
Called my son twice, he ain't picking up the phone
And Banks, me and him don't even talk no more
You know cause of me, he ain't never have to sell crack
Never used no knife or had to squeeze no strap
But if I go tonight, I bet you I'm hellbound
For cocaine distribution and letting off MAC rounds
Home invasion robberies, we ran in that crack house
Took them niggas paper and all of they packs out

Then I was in the second row the second time Em married Kim
Looking at Proof like, ""How much you think this gon' cost them?""
Feels like a set up, Shaniqua's being nice to me
I rather a nigga just put a knife in me
Than go through the emotions, the confusion and commotions
Never die down in my head, they keep going
It feels like I'm God's punching bag on occasions
Amazing, on other days, I feel like I'm His favorite
I never bite my tongue, I just call a spade a spade
When life feeding me lemons, I just make lemonade
My nana beat cancer, it came back for a rematch
Life without my old girl, I couldn't see that
My grandpa was the strongest, then he broke down and I broke down
I looked around like if shit go bad now, who I'm gon' go to now?
That was his partner, see he knew everything about her
Now he's saying he don't wanna live without her

Here's a taste of my life, it's bitter and sweet
I pour my heart out to the sounds of the drums and the beat
I put my life on the line when I'm out on the street
Put my Teflon on, and roll with my heat
I keep my circle nice and small, I don't fuck with these clown niggas
In the race for the cheese, I run laps around niggas
Soon as I step on stage, the crowd applauds
Soon as my sneaker went in stores, Reebok stock soared
I ain't gotta say I'm a boss, niggas can tell
The East Coast crib the size of a small hotel
The shit journalists write about me leave me confused
Have me feeling like the heavyweight champ when he lose
I read somewhere I'm homophobic—shit...
Go through the hood, there's mad niggas on my dick
Now, we can get hostile, or we can do this smooth
TNT around, I can still make blow move

Stay on point, 'cause niggas will ride and smoke you
Jealousy's for women, but some niggas is bitch-made
They make you wanna run across they head with a switchblade
They point the finger at me, saying I'm bugged
My flow's crack, you listen, your fucking brain's on drugs
Look, ice drippin' on my neck, hands gripping on a TEC
Fool tripping, threw a set, you can get your ass wet
Cards messing up my deck, screws loose show respect
You try to come at me kid, your ass better come correct

[Chorus]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
[Verse 3]
My mama gave birth to a winner, I gotta win
Pray the Lord forgive me for my sins (Uh-huh), I'm still thugging
Cruising, rims gleaming like the stones on my wrist
Zoning—guess this is how it feels to be rich
Homie, you hustling backwards if you chasing a bitch
Stupid, chase the paper—they come with the shit
I'm falling... in love with success
Entrepreneur, connoisseur, I maneuver the best
Rolling Ruger on my lap, rubber grip on the handle
Stunner, have your homies burning Rest-in-Peace candles
As wise men speak, I listen and learn
A man dies, a baby's born, my nigga, the world turns
Rappers, I make 'em sick when I say I'm the shit
They mistake my confidence for arrogance, they hate on the kid
In '99, I had a vision and made a decision
Being broke is against my religion, now I'm caked up, what!

[Chorus]
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go
This is what you call rider music
All the gangsters are riding to it—c'mon, let's roll
I can show you how we do it
When we ride to that rider music, (Let's go) let's go

[Snorts cocaine]
Nigga, (yeah), nigga, you know I don't fuck with them niggas. Them niggas pussy. Sucka ass niggas. I don't like either one (I don't even like 'em). But the other night I'm in the gambling spot. Nigga come up in here - boom - hit the door. ""Get the fuck on the floor, bitch, get down on the floor."" I turn around like, ""what?"" Niggas like, ""get down!"" (When was this?) I'm like, ""nigga, I got on white linen.""

[Intro]
Fuck it, I mean we gotta kill what we eat, right? It's not a problem, it's really not a problem. Southside

[Verse 1]
Okay, the dope addin' up, the coke addin' up
The smoke addin' up, my pockets are fattened up
I got bitches in my bedroom, nerds on computers
Diamonds 'round my neck, straps for my shooters
I made it, look ma', I made it
I grind so hard to get here I can't be faded
I got lawyers on the line, five different kinds
Five different crimes, same .45
Got client-attorney privilege, so a nigga ain't lyin'
Cause they ain't gon' say I did it and I ain't gon' say I did it
And I might go back and forth to court, but I bet I get acquitted
Can you dig it? Nigga, can you dig it?
Shit changed, a nigga ain't broke
I had a safe size as a shoe box, it felt like a vault
Now I got real money, that ""fuck how you feel"" money
That ""nigga, you look at me wrong, get killed"" money
[Hook]
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
Hop out, hammer out to get at you
You gon' be part of my body bag ritual
.45 lettin' off some shit at you
You gon' be put in a body bag
You won't get a chance to fire back

[Verse 2]
I peep my swag in the mirror, I think I got a crush on me
I don't want no wack bitches touchin' me
Tailor-made threads, satin sheets on my bed
Get a bitch sea-sick, waves all on my head
Diamonds in my ear, Baccarat chandelier
Gabbana underwear, I'm so fly it ain't fair
Every day a different dime piece
Rose Gold, a different time piece
Hublot, AP or rollie
Your bitch and your jeweler know me, homie
I'm bulletproof, go 'head, take a shot at me
You be a dead nigga like the last one that got at me
My shirt level three so I ain't got a vest on
My heart like ice, my chest like teflon
I'm a nightmare right here, just me and my knife, nigga
Don't let me find out you ain't 'bout that life, nigga
It's doomsday, I mean goon day
I get the orders, like, ""air out the room, Dre""

[Verse 3]
The mollies had a shorty ass trippin' strippin' in my kitchen
Push my thumb in her ass while I was strokin' her kitten
I be in my own zone, still clutchin' the chrome
Talk state of the art, you will see 'nine to foe
My passport need pages, I'm fuckin' round' out in London
Jetlag from jets, wrist lit baguettes
Trippin' in my charm, look bitch, I'm a don
So shit go how I say it go, fuck if I'm right or wrong
My paper long, bomb kush in the bong
It feels like I'm dreamin' cause a nigga on
I'm so far from a hammy down, I'm out in Miami now
My bitch no  speak no ingles, she fresh off the boat
She give me neck, what you expect? I got connects for the dope
I'm no joke, blow 30k on the coke, stuff ten in the coat
Nigga, front, I'll have a hand full of dreadlocks
Bitch, I hit your ass with a headshot

You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wanna be her
She used to have the Beamer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eating lobster, now she eating pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about fronting
Think about stunting when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet ski's slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racing through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line and you're a friend of mine
Come on, let's ride

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinking 'bout a shipment
She thinking I'm her hustler, she thinking 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with a bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that, kid
I'm thinking what this bitch thinking when she take me to court
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?""
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shopping spree's
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinking 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinking damn, girl, we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

Aw!
It hurts
The D's trying to pin a murder on me
In the precinct they saying I done murdered homie
I told my lawyer I ain't heard of homie
And everybody know my niggas murder for me

[Verse 1]
You see homo on your crib, it ain't a burglary homey
They finna to have me stuck in purgatory
I'm down to do the sticking when it come to the orgy
Conventional methods of sex, totally bore me
Wait, I'm getting sidetracked, back to the story
These cocksucking police got it in for me
They flash their lights, they wanna rough me up
Frisk me, find my burner and cuff me up
But history repeats itself, they never learn
The Unit's the new Bebo's, who gon' be Eddie Byrne?
Huh, we'll find out when niggas let off the rounds
And his partner's screaming officer down

[Chorus]
Police get in the way
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes
I'll murder them, I said I'll murder them
Any motherfucker touch me
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
You don't believe me, wait and see
I'll murder them, you see I told you I'd murder them
[Verse 2]
They saying I'm an accident waiting to happen
I got one in the head, I'm just waiting to clap it
A pimp told me I was made for this mack shit
So just get you a white girl, don't fuck with no black bitch
I got two felonies from selling that crack shit
And the third one, came from showing niggas my mac spit
See I'm down for that daytime action
Have niggas crawling under cars when I start to cappin'
So they don't know what to say to the captain
But they know if word get back, something gon' happen
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, but I ain't been snitched on
When you snitching where I'm from you gon' get your shit blown
Southside - I make the best of the worst
We gotta share the same bitch, okay, I go first
Cause your baby's momma is my baby's momma
I come through to see my little nigga with the llama

[Chorus]
Police get in the way
I'll murder them, I'll murder them
A nigga already got three strikes
I'll murder them, I said I'll murder them

If Suge was home, Death Row would be good for me
Cause Tommy Mattola ain't shootin out in the hood wit me
I've been shot 9 times my nigga that's why I walk funny
Hit in the jaw once, why I talk funny
With a Ruger on my hip, I walk the street with no care
Think my grandma's prayers the only reason I'm here
My wrist icy, keep my ears icy, keep my neck icy
That's why you bitch like me, son I'm a heavyweight
How dare these niggas take me lightly?
I ain't come to make friends and niggas ain't gotta like me

Born a healthy baby, I wasn't always crazy
This ain't how moma raised me, this how the hood made me
The D's call me by my government name
I be dumb and shoot up parks
Have niggas runnin' like ""Jesus Comin'""
There's wet pillows in prison, niggas cry in the dark
Cause if they did in the day, niggas would question they heart
So when they come home, the come home

Yo, yo, we can't stay alive forever
So if shit hit the fan, then we might as well die together
I'm high as ever, more hoes and more cheddar
G-Unit move around with them pounds and Berettas
Yeah faggot, if I want it, I'm gon' have it
Regardless if it's handed to me, or I got to grab it
Don't make a ass out of yourself trying to stop me
I'm cocky, rap's Rocky, nigga you sloppy
You know that I'm, eight levels above you nigga
I'll club you nigga, I never heard of you nigga
Ugly nigga, I'm the wrong one to provoke
You ratting on niggas is only going to leave you smoked
So the only thing left now, is toasts for these cowards
I got no friends; fuck most of these cowards
They pop shit; 'till we start approaching these cowards
While we lay around dollars; they lay around flowers
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I got a industry gangstress, that argues, and steams the reefer
And flip when I call her bitch, like she Queen Latifah
Now all the vehicles is long enough to stash the street sweeper
This shit can get uglier than the Master P sneaker
I'm sliding through the Rucker, with Prada on the chuckers
So the spring break hoes home from college want to fuck us
I ain't here to drop knowledge on you suckers
I sic Rottweilers on you fuckers, cops following to cuff us
Top dollars to discuss this, whole lot of zeros
When it come to paper, I blow the soul out a hero
I'ma break before I lay in the floor buried, besides
Every rapper ain't a star, and every plaid ain't Burberry
You can't tame Lloyd, we're smoking by the big screen
Changing the channel, looks like I'm playing the Game Boy
I know the watch bothering your vision
But reach, and I put a dot on your head
Like it's part of your religion
Why party with a pigeon? I'm blowing a ten
Because Bush handing out flyers, for a party in the prison
I'm in the Gucci vest, with the green and red straps
I'm the last rapper to scare niggas since Craig Mack
Now every morning's a fast start
But it ain't a problem getting dressed
Because my closet got more aisles than Pathmark
Run when we starting a raid
Or leave with twelve shells in your mouth, like a carton of eggs
I'm a young pimp, pardon my age
I don't got long hair, but if I did she'd be parting my braids
Niggas find out what club they at, take them with us
And run trains on them, like a subway map
Your advance is a grey Acura; see these record labels
Got most artists getting fucked like the gay rapper
I go to college on the tour
I'm going down in history nigga, next to Wallace and Shakur
Keep your ammo clean, TECs polished in the drawer
Camera's by the hampers that monitor the floor
By now, you probably heard of me, fresh out of surgery
Flashy as a fuck, you going to have to murder me
Burglary, I'm leaving with your Nikes burgundy
White tee burgundy, you match now, back down
Niggas love to hate you, but love you when you disappear
Catch me on a boat, with weed smoke and fishing gear
Heavy when I tote, C-notes from different years
Bezzy and the rope, remotes and lifting chairs
You ain't rich, but we glad to snatch ya
I send cars to your crib like I'm a cab dispatcher
You better off with the stupid guys, looking for a coupe to drive
You ain't getting nutting, but you french fries supersized
It's a damn shame y'all still local
I'm in a million dollar studio laying my vocals, nigga
[Outro: 50 Cent]
You still in the projects nigga, you ain't going nowhere
You going to be there for the rest of your motherfucking life
And your mama saying: I'm supposed to tell you something, to encourage you
Something positive, alright:
Well, I ain't going to lie to you motherfucker;
You ain't going nowhere
Get yourself a beer, and get on the fucking curb {*gunshot*}
Fucking dirtbag {*gunshot*}7Embed"

I want the beat to drop in, right, like, now
Niggas be thinkin' I'm crazy right? Yeah, you are crazy
I ain't crazy - you are crazy - at least I don't think I'm crazy
I think my shit is hot, I think I'm hot  you hot, but you crazy
Why they wanna? I don't know

[Verse 1]
It's the money that makes shit get ugly
It's the money that makes these hoes love me
It's the money that makes niggas wanna slug me
Man, I thought the money would make it all lovely
Yo, I actually write what I do and see
The felonies from day to day make me say what I say
When I die my art will be worth as much as Picasso's
Don't cry for me, smile for me
And if you see them niggas who wet me wile' for me
Remember the good times, the chips we stacked, the clips we packed
And all the bricks we cooked from coke to crack
Let my tombstone read ""I Tried"" and from the start
Everything I wrote was from my heart
So it’s always gon' be number one on my chart
I get sensitive with my shit, don't fuck with my art
Sometimes it sounds like I'm playing, but I'm sayin'
This shit is real, it ain't a game

I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

[Verse 2]
First it happened to Stretch then to Pac and Big
I'm convinced it can happen to anybody, kid
So I get vest up when I get dressed up
In the hood it's messed up, niggas running 'round shooting shit up
If it's Dom that you drinking fill up my cup
If you gossiping about me shut the fuck up
Why do niggas act like they hard when they know they butt?
When getting robbed ain't a good time to press ya luck
Duke listen, if you move I'mma hurt you
You'll get your turn to shine later, patience is a virtue
Right now what you need to do is give me the cash
Forget about your boss being mad, just save ya ass
Be a good boy now, go and get your stash
I seen you throw it next to the garbage can like it was trash
Alright, run along before I shoot ya ass
I hate to do this to you, but I really need this cash

Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine
They say the good die young
I guess these grimy niggas live a long time
Sit in fancy whips, sip champagne and shine
Keep your eyes on yours while I keep my eyes on mine

[Verse 3]
I know we all gonna go, but I'd hate to go fast
Then again I don't think it'd be fun to stick around and go last
Man listen, if you really really like this shit
Nigga, call Steve Stoute and I'll write ya shit
Call him now before I drop for real cause after I drop
I'mma be chargin' ya'll niggas like forty a pop
To each his own: me? I'd get it while it was cheap
Typical mentality, I know, I'm straight from the street
1999's the year of the predator, I'm killing to eat
Niggas'll treat you like a egg, when you come to cop you get beat
Give me your dough, oh, you wore your jewels? What a treat
You're a generous guy, take 'em off or die
Man, we hurting 'round here, ain't nobody slinging pies
Look around, ain't nobody 'round here fly
Why you 'round here with this shit anyway? Huh? You high?
See, you done made the wrong move, kiss your ass goodbye

[Intro]
Boy you forgot my style

[Verse 1]
Flowers, a funeral service, a kid's in the coffin
It sound so familiar, don't it happen so often?
The shoot-out shit happens, the sister read the eulogy
Couldn't help but think ''nigga better you than me''
.38 ain't got no safety, that bullet got no name on it
But it's hard to miss when that thing got a beam on it
First shot, pop off, everybody popping shots
The glass at the store front, we forgot God was watching
Run, run, hit the gate, D's yelling ''drop it''
Niggas getting jammed up, better that than a jammed up
His momma said a few words to her, he was innocent
She might have heard he did some shit, but never saw no benefits
So in her eyes, he's mommy's little baby
But he was outside talking to niggas crazy
In a room full of people came to pay their respect
I just came in to get a close look at nigga to check
That nigga dead as a doorknob, stiff as a nail
And my man, tomorrow he gon' get out of jail
ROR, trust me nigga I know the law
Release on your own recognizance, that bullshit I'm on it
That's his first taste, I mean his first case
Got knocked with the strap, but not the one that clapped
This nigga here we still got that, yeah
First law in my hood is show no fear
Him and love was closer than we thought, that nigga in here crying
Oh shit, in the store, he probably passed him the iron
These some grimy ass niggas, full breed vultures
Trying to come up, still eating around roaches
Cookie Crisp, Captain Crunch, breakfast of the champions
Lucky charms, stay armed, and niggas won't clap you then
We watch the side bitch talking like she his main bitch
His wifey just sat there, preachers weren't saying shit
Right jab, left hook, hand full of weave
This type shit a nigga got to see to believe
These bitches acting up in here
Police they don't fucking care
Homicides snooping around of them, we all with the shit
Cousin back from college saying he gon' get who did this shit
He a ball player nigga, nigga better play ball
You play with the wrong niggas we gon' get to letting off
I done seen enough, feel like it's time for me to split
Hit the parking lot, chill where the weed is lit
Twist the cap, pour out a little liquor
All the theatrics, you know, like that was my nigga
We all can't win, some of us got to lose
Envision a lil' dog barking at a pack of wolves
Cause that's what happened, yeah yeah, that's what happened
He just went on and on till niggas started attacking
Acting like he was the only motherfucker packing

I came to bring you that California love
And a little New York hate, it's all of the above
I'm not playin', I said I'm off the chain
You niggas better follow instructions, I said (get up!)

[Verse 1]
I ball ‘til I fall, stunt 'til I drop
'Em off the showroom floor, not the used car lot
You buy a bottle, I buy the bar
I make every other week feel like Mardi Gras
When I get into it, I get into it
Everybody can’t do it the way I do it
I make it rain, till the sun come out
A nigga playin', we make the guns come out
Now, my question is who they gon' blame
When I'm back number one on the Billboard again?
Shit shift now, the game done changed
Since Mike made Thriller and Prince made Purple Rain
I guess I made the kids want slang
And N.W.A. made the West Coast bang
Nah, it's just music man, it's just music
Now get your ass on the dance floor and move it

Yeah, lady, you look good, I wanna get to know you better
You look good in them jeans and them red stilettos
You got a Bentley Coupe booty baby, I wanna drive
See it'll tell you what your mileage is when I'm inside
I wanna take you for a spin, you know, round and round
Switch gears till' your love comes down
I take you to the point of no return if you listen you learn
Just how a nigga earn, I got money to burn
While they can't get a place, she drop the bomb on me
It's up and down and up and down gracefully
Rick James would've said She a Brick House
But Fifty you should go home and see what that bitch bout
I find out she like it how I like it, huh
Back it up, get ya some, I know how to get ya sprung
Tune ya up and use the tongue, under the hood is so good

It's cold (It's cold, it's cold)
So cold (So cold, so cold)

[Hook]
Y'all niggas know (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Know what I'm about (Y'all niggas know)
Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

Fuck with my dough (What-what y'all niggas know?)
Then the guns come out (Then the guns come out)

[Verse 1]
I do this all the time, stuck with a little shine
Walk with a little nine, case I get in a bind
They say I'm fucking crazy, they think I'm out my mind
Cause I'm down to bust a nigga head all the time
Now you know the hoes, they know how I roll
In that new Rolls with the suicide doors
22 inch chrome, a nigga money long
You try to touch me, I pull out, you get your brains blown
You go against the grain, pussy and you on your own
You're entering in my zone, welcome to the terrordome
The ice blowing my chain, blood blue in my veins
Blue still in the range, I'm doing my thang
The semi-auto spray, run if you get away
We'll find your whereabouts and clap at you another day
Nigga play with the bread, get a hole in ya head
You touch a dime of mine thug and your ass dead
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
In the hood, hoopty, hat low, niggas don't know I'm around
Hop out, hit 'em up, lay my murder game down
You see me in ya projects, 187's in progress
Hard niggas finna soften up when that lead touch 'em
You cut 'em once he keep fighting, fuck it just keep cutting 'em
It's real killa instinct, kill or be killed
Trust me, you don't wanna feel how hollow tips feel
Fuck around and get your cap peeled, nigga you know the drill
Brownsville, Flatbush, Crown Heights, Brooklyn Zoo
Feed the wolves, they eat the food and the hand that feed 'em too
Nigga welcome to the jungle, New York, New York
Gangstas use sign language and let their guns talk
Look homie, I'm cool with some Bloods, I'm cool with some Crips
I'm cool but if there's a problem, nigga I got extra clips
I don't know karate, but I split the bricks
I don't love 'em lover boy, we can share a bitch
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'll come through and touch ya, walk out then cut ya
In case your dumbass wanna tussle
AR-15, cooling system makes the shell case muffled
Scope, infrared, run you're still dead
Hit your calf, hit your ass, hit ya back, then your head
Contract killa, murder for the scrilla
Search, find a nigga, run up behind a nigga
Shoot car windows out to flatline a nigga
Gun pop, heart stop, homie this is heavy
You on your way to meet your maker, nigga are you ready
No exception to the rule, death is promised
Plus I just bought my niggas new Macs and llamas
Got respect for human life, but will accommodate you
One phone call and niggas will exterminate you
No future fucking with me, there's no tomorrow
Niggas'll run up on you tonight and hit you with hollows

This mic on?
Ladies and gentlemen
I'd like to thank you for coming out tonight
For the screening of my new film
""I'm Not Rich I'm Still Lyin'""
It's 50 Cent starring as Game, it's autobiographical
I hope you enjoy yourselves
[Verse 1: 50 impersonating Game's voice]
50 callin me crazy, I might be just maybe
I'm gangsta I'm crippin', the Damu I'm trippin'
Fuck 50, fuck Dre, fuck N.W.A
Man I'm Hurricane Game (Em this nigga changed)
I brought the west back, I write the best raps
(But what about Snoop?) Snoop shit ain't all that
And I get bad bitches now I even fucked Mya
(I fucked her first, Game) 50 you a liar
See that's why I hate you, you think you know me
I'mma tell everybody you shot my homie
I hope the police get you and you go to jail
Feds freeze your accounts so you can't make bail
I hope everybody on G-Unit go to hell
Wit Eminem, Obie, Stat Quo and D-12
So what I was on Change of Heart?, so what I was a stripper?
So what I never banged? I'm from Compton nigga!
[Hook]
Now horror films they scare me
I watch action films very rarely
When it's comedy or it's drama
It's starrin me no problem
Now horror films they scare me
I watch action films very rarely
When it's comedy or it's drama
It's starrin me no problem

[Verse 2]
G-G-G-G-Unot! I got my own shoe (Game that shit ain't gon' sell)
So, the ad's in the magazine nobody can't tell
(Good luck wit yo next album man I hope it does well)
You tryna be funny, D-Mack got all my money
And Jimmy robbin me, they listenin probably
Me and Fase had a fall out he really not my brother
We got the same father but we got different mothers
Now Suge punked Dre but he don't punk me
I won a Vibe Award this year nobody punch me
(Game you know I wrote that hook for ""Hate It or Love It"")
So what, it's still on my trophy case I think nothing of it

[Hook]
Now horror films they scare me
I watch action films very rarely
When it's comedy or it's drama
It's starrin me no problem
Now horror films they scare me
I watch action films very rarely
When it's comedy or it's drama
It's starrin me no problem
[Outro: 50 Cent (normal)]
Yeah; it's 50
New album, July 18th
It's called ""I Can't Stay Away""
Y'all thought I was gonna let y'all eat? Naw nigga
Oh! This is too much fun man
Hey... hey nigga I seen yo lil DVD nigga
Is that all you got? I mean newsflash: nobody believes you
Then you say you woke up outta coma 2001
Well yo brother says you never were in a coma
Then you say you were in a gang
Well yo brother says you were never in a gang
Now you can get your records together
And you can submit 'em to me
I mean you can send the records you have to me
So I can... open... ya album budget, your recording budget
You gotta send your music to the boss.... that's me, the boss
Yeah....it's D-Unit, G-Unit, that's it, that's all
I rule with a iron fist

You're a sucker for love, nigga, I'm money making

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm still a baller, I'm still balling
That's five times I ain't picked up, your bitch still calling
I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit
Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick
We still mobbin', niggas still starvin'
We still deal after deal, shit is no problem
He still love her, she ain't shit
Get her a pair of Louboutins, she suck a dick
He's still a real niggas, still will kill
Told the still bitch don't squeal or get your cap peeled
The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips
Copper-tops, get your ass popped, watch a body drop

[Verse 2: Kidd Kidd]
I'm clean as a motherfucker, still getting my hands dirty
Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you looking thirsty
See I'm a gangsta, you soft as R&B singers
I'm at a war with the banger, in the club with the shanker
Mask on, lone ranger, scope on the K, long ranger
Rather be alive and rich than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, I crash into anything
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sing
Rims on, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out of you, nigga
Trying to pull out your pistol when you know that you're lame
You chasing these bitches instead of chasing your paper
Niggas taking your bitches while they taking your paper
I'm gone

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
She on my leg like a little kid
She hump my leg like a horny bitch
Pitbull in a skirt, yeah, I'm a magnet
Nah, I ain't running after no broad, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pockets turn her eyes green
She's seeing dollar signs, I'm seeing reasons why
Never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt, look
There ain't a bitch more dime than me
The thirst is real, she knocking over drinks to get next to me
While you..

[Verse 4: Styles P]
Ghetto niggas still'll pick a penny up
You outside chasing them hoes throwing your Henny up
Little homie loading a semi up
Catch 'em all after the club, tell 'em the ante up
Anyway, each and every day, I'm looking for a better way
You owe me, you better pay
Ghost, let the beretta spray
Hood want uncut dope and some better yay
I ain't chasing pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still a rider, still rolling, still need a mask
Still popping, still slinging, still need the cash

May tomorrow bring you everything your heart desires
Let your drive and ambition offer you new visions
May your gut-instinct help you make good decisions
This is more than Champagne, this is more than just a glass
This is a symbol of accomplishment we rarely ever had (ha ha!)
Let's enjoy tonight like tonight's our last
We can focus on the future and reflect on the past (WOOO!)
We done came so far, I mean, look where we are
If they don't call us by name they call us entrepreneurs
From the block to the board room, the hood to the high life
Skyscraper paper, baby, life in the limelight
Want the best of the best, the top of the top

Product of the environment (uh), they ain't been what we've been through (yeah)
I'm fond of the phrase ""If there's a will, there's a way""
'Cause we come from the parts where only killers could play
Southside (Southside), it's alright
The ghetto's my Alma Mater huh? It's alright (WOOO!)
We could keep the party jumpin' like this all night
The bottles, just keep 'em comin', baby, let's get right
Let's get it on, play a little Marvin
It’s gettin' hot in here, homie, this could be a problem
Keni Burke style, let's keep rising to the top (uh)

Got so many Cuban links with me, my chain can get deported
At the bar takin' shots, you are out, you need reloading

I'm moving on now, I got bigger fish to fry (Uh-huh)
Since ""How to Rob,"" a lot of niggas been namin' names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game (Uh-huh)
Still niggas actin' like I don't get down or something
Like I ain't the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gon' talk about your chips 'til we run in your crib
Then, you gon' ask dumb questions like, ""Can I live?""
""Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me, you're brainless""—you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the Mac and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Tone and Poke, they better have my bail
But if it's over a mil, don't put the crib up, dun
'Cause if 50 get free, nigga, 50 gon' run

I ain't gotta steal from the cornerstore no more
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the floor no more
Bouncers don't try to play me at the door no more
But when they see me, they say, ""Search him, he might have the nine"" (Yeah!)
""He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne""
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this (Uh-huh)
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feeling it, the Benz pulling up on the set (UH-huh)
Me jumping out, 30 thou on my neck (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
And since you said it was nothing to sweat (What)
You was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass-kicking, Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how... he reacts under pressure
Til Makaveli returns, it's all eyes on me
Til the feds build a case or find files on me

Why give her love and affection, she just want some bread
I ain't talking or texting, I just want some head
She from a Piru set where all them niggas wear red
I ain't flying no flags, but I'm a gangster, bitch
I say ''say no to drugs'' then I do that shit
Got a blue fleet of whips, I'm so hood nigga rich
You don't like the way I do it, nigga, eat a dick
I just call 'em when I want 'em, I don't need a bitch
You see me stunting with my diamonds on, everything proper
Your shit look chrome and your shit look copper
It's turning, homie, that's why you're turning on me
Admit it, I made it, I can't be faded
I roll it up in public, I'm a cancer, man
Smoke it out in the open like I'm in Amsterdam
I do a hundred miles an hour switching lens in my lane
See my name around the globe, niggas know who I am

[Hook x8]

[Verse 2]
You say you hustle like a hustle, I be moving the shit
Had a couch and a U-Haul filled up with bricks
Got them straps and long clips filled up with led
So when we counting the paper it better come back correct
Out in New Orleans, baby, niggas hungry for bread
Come throrugh that 9th ward stuntin' and get shot in your head
Every hood I go through they fuck with me, you dig?
Got the eye of the tiger, I'm on that animal shit
I got the heart of a lion and the looks of an elephant
Yeah, I'm scared of rats, but I'm ready for anything
It's the unit, my nigga, take a look at my face
See if you test me they'll arrest me, I'll be catching a case
New York a concrete jungle where niggas got to get paid
Get in the way of that paper and niggas got to get sprayed
Look at me wrong and you're dead, you'd be very afraid
I don't know how to behave, untamed fresh out the cage

Baby, follow my lead (follow my lead)
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me
Follow my lead - follow my lead
I'm the one girl in time you'll see
If you follow my lead

[Verse 1]
Don't listen to the rumors, they say 50 fucking crazy
50 don't know how to treat a lady, they wrong
I like you a lot, I don't wanna hurt you
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle
So if you act like a bitch, I'll call you a bitch
Then hang up, probably call you right back and shit
And have to say, ""baby I apologize""
Cross my fingers, God forgive me for telling lies
Like Janet Jackson said, I miss you much
I really wanna feel your touch, and smell your scent
Baby, I can pass the day watching you model lingerie
I wanna spend the night tonight, shorty, if it's okay
You can be my Beyonce, I'll be your Jay
Ha ha - I got a great sense of humor
First I make you smile then I woo you, you know I wanna do ya
Or do ya?
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
After seven hours, New York to London, you're wonderin'
What's gon' be the next stop - I told you
I'm a don, you gon' know I'm a don
After you shop 'til your feet hurting in Milan
Now take a picture, these are moments you can cherish
They say the scenery was made for lovers out in Paris
Ask your fan about me, they say 50 we love him
Without them there's no me, so I love them
Man they're the reason I exist, the reason I insist
I'm never less than the best, I'm perfection I guess
As my niggas are stressed, I pass the test
Every time I drop I'm burning hot
So I don't care if she loves me or loves me not
Long as I enjoy the time that we spend
I ain't looking for commitment, we can fuck and be friends
Matter fact, we can do it right in back of my Benz
I get it done with speed

[Intro]
Don't make this complicated (don't make it)
My old school candy painted (for real)
I hustle hard
When I come through they like ""Oh my God!""
(THAT NIGGA CLEAN!)

[Chorus]
From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz - and move it
I'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler, baby (say what?)
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes, but dig it
I'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler, baby

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I come through, I had the hoes like ''who he?''
Seats in the old school Louie
Shoes and the belt buckle Louie
We don't need more details now, do we?
Let 'em sag, my swag is True Religion
You gon' need Cartier frames to see my vision
It smells like cream mixed with weed, this is classy and hood
Drama llama time, nigga, what's good?
Domino's, muh'fucker, it's time to collect
Stack paper like I'm trying to fix the national debt (wooo!)
I'm just doing what I wanna do, I trip through your set
This is 50 on that Muammar Gaddafi shit
[Chorus]
From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz - and move it
I'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler, baby (say what?)
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes, but dig it
I'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler, baby

[Verse 2]
Get on my level, bitch, I'm careful who I kick it with
We talk market and distribution and politics (woo!)
Got a chip on my shoulder, chip off the whole block
I sell the chip of a whole rock, 10 dollars a pop
I'm a magnet, the bitch can't help but watch me
Socks, drawers, undershirt, Versace, Versace, Versace
Designer threads in every form of fashion (uh huh)
I express myself so the question I'm askin' (aaoow!)
Is this flip or the next flip tailor 50 shit?
We ain't promised tomorrow, nigga, go on and get the shit (yeah)
That skull and bones, that Alexander McQueen thing
In case you ain't notice it's a Queens thing (wooooo!)

[Chorus]
From the beginning It Was Written I suppose
I break a whole on the 36 oz - and move it
I'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler, baby (say what?)
My mind on the money, I ain't tripping on the hoes
I blow a whole lot of paper on clothes, but dig it
I'm a hustler, baby (can you dig it?)
I'm a hustler, baby
[Outro]
OHHH! It's cold out here
It's my kind of weather, I'm cold blooded
It's 50
When I come through you see me
In the Suburbans that's bulletproof
Bomb proof, leather six, whatever
When I go hard I go hard
When I don't want you to see me I switch it up
I'm in that black on black Porsche Panamera
In the back like ''ooh wee''
We rolling
I hustle, man, it's what I do, man
Wait, niggas gon' try and tell me how to do this?24Embed"

Now don't think I won't hit you because I'm popular
I got a P-90 Ruger to pop at ya
Catch you slipping, I'ma give you what I got for ya
My clip loaded with sixteen shots for ya
You never had a hot gun on your waist and blood on your shoe
Because a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you
Homie, you ain't been through what I been through
You not like me, and I'm not like you
I'm like an animal with it when I spit it, it's crazy
Got semi-autos to put holes in niggas tryin' to play me (Yeah)
One shot is not enough, you need 'least a Uzi to move me (Woo)
After four bottles of Dom the kid start to feeling woozy
I write my life, you write what you see in gangsta movies
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga, you can't move me
I find my space at the top, I got this rap shit locked (Uh-huh)
I never heard of you, you heard of me, I murder you
Spit shells to your convertible Lotus
You notice, richer or poor, hollows still go through your door, this is war
You scared of me, you not prepared for me, the kid is back

Shorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off
Just pull 'em to the side
If you wanna ride on the roller coaster
Baby, come on and ride
It go up and down and round and round
Stand up or get on the floor
It's on tonight, I know what you like
I know just how to break you off

[Verse 1]
Good evening ladies, I'll tell you from the start
I'm hoping you enjoy my amusement park
There's lots of activities, fun things to do
And I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
Some rides go fast, some rides go slow
You fear heights when I'm high, hell yeah I'll go low
It tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
We get carried away, we be starting a family
It's a perfect time for a magic trick
Girl, you know it's no fun without the magic stick
Now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
Then you can use the rabbit all over your cat
Applause now, that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp, now I'm more like a mac
I don't need your paper, just don't fuck with my stacks
(Oh, it's like that?) Yeah, it's like that

Shorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off

I know just how to break you off

[Verse 2]
Now you can ride the horse around the carousel
Explosions, Trojans, all in the hotel
Put me to the test, girl, I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
There's plenty water rides, I'm sure to get you wet in the park
Have your lusting seductions considered an art
Throw a hoop around the bottle, I'll be your teddy bear
Whatever color you like, you know I don't care
I really wanna thank ya for attending this affair
Now go encourage your friends to come have fun here
I smile when I speak, but I'm being sincere
And your pass is valid all summer, my dear
So at your convenience you can always return
There's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
Suck that, lick that, swallow that lollipop
Forget that, grip that, ride it nonstop
[Chorus]
Shorty, you ain't gotta take your panties off
Just pull 'em to the side

If youse a casualty of war, trust me I got more

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience no morals or nothin
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggas hatin on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggas fo' sho' man, hold me down

Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker

Every word out my mouth is felt; that oo-wop pop
Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt - I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down - and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa, hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant

One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin for his enemies
Ridin gassed up, off double D batteries

They putting pressure on me, son, now they want me to snap
End up like X and Whitney in my mansion smoking crack
I'm paranoid, I'm feeling like niggas is trying to get me
Forget the kids, I'm shaving off my fucking head like Britney
Man, Dre won't mix my records, now I need to talk to Jimmy
I'm falling back in my old ways, I'm riding with the semi
Who's calling me? It's Chris, he's on the other line with Diddy
But I don't wanna talk right now, my day is going shitty
Why's Jay rocking that Urkel look, man, isn't he from Marcy?
They say he's growin dreads and now he's talking like a Yardie
Man, everything is changing, I don't understand a thing

I'm laughing cause she kissed him in his mouth and gave him herpes
That just makes him one of 50 niggas wanting to murk me
Niggas found my truck and burnt it up out there in Jersey
You can ask my son, he'll tell you ""my dad's fucking crazy""
She filled his head with shit and now I think he fuckin' hates me
Shady didn't invent me but a star is what he made me
I'll blow your fuckin' mind out if I told you what he paid me
He gave me all the pills he had left, that's why I'm so high
It makes me feel so good now that I'm not so scared to die
I wish a nigga would, I dare a motherfucker try

In case they wanna send me up for murder like Max
Man I wasn't the shooter, I was never on the scene
So if they do forensics they'll find out it wasn't me
There's no need for a lie detector, I ain't sayin shit
The more you talk the higher chances you're doing a bid
Today I read the paper, it said Tru Life caught a case
They said they found a victim with a knife stuck in his face
I spoke to Michael Vick, I told him I'm happy he home
