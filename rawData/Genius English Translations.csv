I miss you
Saying this makes me miss you all even more
I miss you
Even though I’m looking at your photo
Time's so cruel, I hate us
Seeing each other is now more difficult
It's all winter here, even in August
My heart is running on time, alone on the Snowpiercer
I want to go to the other side of Earth, holding your hand, put an end to winter
How much should my longings fall like snow
Before the days of spring return, friend?

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, V]
Like the tiny dust, tiny dust floating in the air
I could've reached you faster
If I was snow flying in the air

[Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook, V & j-hope]
Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
How many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)
[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook]
Pass the end of winter's cold
Until the spring day comes again
Until the flowers bloom again
Please stay, please stay there a little longer

[Verse 2: Suga, Jimin]
Is it you who changed? (Is it you who changed)
Or is it me? (Or is it me)
I hate this moment, this time flowing by
We've changed, you know?
Just like everyone, you know?
Yes, I hate you, you left me
But I never stopped thinking about you, not even a day
I miss you, honestly, but I’ll erase you
'Cause it hurts less than to blame you

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
I try to exhale you in pain
Like smoke, like white smoke
I say that I’ll erase you
But I can’t really let you go yet

[Chorus: Jung Kook & j-hope, Jung Kook, V & j-hope]
Snowflakes fall down
And fall apart little by little
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
How long do I have to wait
And how many nights do I have to pass
To see you? (To see you)
To meet you? (To meet you)
[Bridge: V, Jung Kook, Jimin]
You know it all, you’re my best friend
The morning will come again
No darkness, no season can't last forever

[Chorus: Jimin & j-hope, Jung Kook, Jung Kook & j-hope, V]
Maybe cherries are blossoming
And winter is going to be over
I miss you (I miss you)
I miss you (I miss you)
Wait a little bit, just a few more nights
I’ll be there to see you (I'll go there to meet you)
I’ll come for you (I'll come for you)

[Post-Chorus: Jin & j-hope, Jin]
Pass the end of winter's cold
Until the spring day comes again
Until the flowers bloom again

Come on over in my direction
So thankful for that, it's such a blessin', yeah
Turn every situation into heaven, yeah
Oh, you are
My sunrise on the darkest day
Got me feelin' some kind of way
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on
Got the only key, know how to turn it on
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear
Baby, take it slow so we can last long

[Verse 1: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
Oh, you, you are the magnet and I'm the metal
I keep getting closer and building up the plan
Just thinking about it raises my heartbeat
Oh, yeah I, I'm already liking you more than usual
All my senses are asking for more
This needs to be taken with no hurry

[Chorus: Luis Fonsi, Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber]
Slowly
I want to smell your neck slowly
Let me whisper things in your ear
So that you'll remember if you're not with me
Slowly
I want to undress you with my kisses, slowly
I sign the walls of your labyrinth
And make your whole body a manuscript
(Hop on, hop on, hop on!
Hop on, hop on!)
[Post-Chorus: Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee]
I want to see your hair dance
I want to be your rhythm
And you show my mouth
Your favorite places
(Favorite, favorite, baby)
Let me surpass your danger zones
To make you scream
And you forget your last name

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]
If I ask you for a kiss, come, give it to me
I know that you're thinking about it
I've been trying for a while
Baby, this is giving and giving it
You know that your heart with mine makes you go bang-bang
You know that she is looking for my bang-bang
Come, taste from my mouth to see what it tastes like
I want to, I want to, I want to see how much love you can take in
I am not in a hurry, I want to take the trip
Let's start slow, then wild

[Pre-Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Justin Bieber]
Step by step, smooth and gentle
We're sticking together, little by little
When you kiss me with such skill
I see that you're malice with tenderness
Step by step, smooth and gentle
We start sticking, little by little
And such beauty is a puzzle
But to solve it here I have the piece
Listen!

This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico
I just wanna hear you screaming, “Oh my god!”
I can move forever when it is with you

I know that you're hesitating because even if you say the truth
In the end it will all return as scars
I'm not going to say anything blatant like ""find strength""
I will let you hear my story, let you hear it

[Verse 2: RM]
What did I say? I said you'd win, didn't I?
I couldn't believe it (really) Could I win it?
This miracle that isn't a miracle
Did we make it? (No) I was here
You were the one that made your way to me
I do believe your galaxy, I want to listen to your melody
Your stars in the Milky Way, don't forget that I found you anyways
At the end of my despair, you're the last reason
For me who was standing at the edge of the cliff, live

Like a rose when blooming
Like cherry blossoms when being scattered in the wind
Like morning glory when fading
Like that beautiful moment
I always want to be the best
So I was impatient and always restless
Comparing myself with others became my daily life
My greed that was my weapon suffocated me and also became a leash
But looking back on it now, truthfully
I feel like it’s not true that I wanted to be the best
I wanted to become your comfort and move your heart
I want to take away your sadness, and pain

On days where I want to disappear forever

Full of loneliness
This garden bloomed
Full of thorns
I bind myself in this sand castle

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
What is your name
Do you have a place to go
Oh could you tell me?
I saw you hiding in this garden

[Pre-Chorus: Jin]
And I know
All of your warmth is real
The blue flower your hand was picking
I want to hold it but

It’s my fate
Don’t smile to me
Light on me
Because I can’t get closer to you
There’s no name you can call me

You know that I can’t
Show you me
Give you me
I can’t show you a ruined part of myself
Once again I put a mask on and go to see you
But I still want you

Bloomed in a garden of loneliness
A flower that resembles you
I wanted to give it to you
After I take off this foolish mask

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
But I know
I can't do that forever
I have to hide
Because I'm a monster

[Chorus: V]
I am afraid
I am shattered
I’m so afraid
That you will leave me again in the end
Once again I put on a mask and go to see you

[Post-Chorus: Jungkook]
The only thing I can do
In the garden
In this world
Is to bloom a pretty flower that resembles you
And to breathe as the me that you know
But I still want you
I still want you
[Chorus: Jin]
Maybe back then
A little
Just this much
If I had the courage to stand before you
Would everything be different now

I'm crying
That’s disappeared
That’s fallen
Left alone in this sandcastle
Looking at this broken mask

Still won't stop (Hey)

Guess I'm only human after all

Dancing off-beat lying on the ground

Than loving someone else, let's admit it

It's dangerous so it's better
You know deep inside
You can't stop it now (You can't stop)
So be honest with me now
Stop, now stop watching and study for your test
Your parents and boss hate me
Video clips, pictures, tweets
V app, Bon Voyage
I know, you can't help what you like
But stop, interpret the music video later
You have so many pictures of me in your room anyway
It's not just one hour, it's a whole year that'll disappear
So this song is a reward I'm giving to you

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, V, Jin & V]
You're not being punished
Come here, I'm your paradise
Can't close your eyes (Can't close your eyes)
You can throw a fit but it's no use (Don't reject me)
Just close your eyes, tune your ears

[Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook]
Follow the sound of the pipe, follow this song
It's a bit dangerous but I'm so sweet
I'm here to save you, I'm here to ruin you
You called me, see? I'm so sweet

[Verse 2: V, SUGA, j-hope]
You know that it's already begun
The moment you hear that sound (Yeah, SUGA)
Maybe I'm a bit dangerous
Like the pied piper
I'm testing you
Like the fruit from the tree of good and evil
My pipe awakens everything
That sound burns you up even more
You're pulled by it, you react
I'm endlessly blowing
I'm your guilty pleasure
You can't escape, never

So weird, I for sure loved you so much
Adapted to you with everything, I wanted to live my life for you
But as I keep doing that I just can't bear the storm inside my heart
The real myself inside the smiling mask, I reveal it entirely

I finally realized so I love me
Not so perfect but so beautiful

I'm meeting the real you, hidden in the storm
Why did I want to hide my precious self like this?

Where is my angel?
The end of a tiring day
Someone come and save me, please
Is overshadowed by a sigh
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The tears reflected in the mirror mean
My colors hid in the smile, blue and grey

[Verse 1: SUGA]
I really don’t know what went wrong
I grew up with a blue question mark in my mind
Maybe that’s why I’ve been fighting for my life
But looking behind, I’m standing hеre dazed
The powеrful shadow swallows me
The question mark is still blue
Is it anxiety or depression?
Am I just an animal that regrets
Or is it me born out of loneliness?
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't get eaten away, I'll find the exit

[Chorus: Jin, Jung Kook, Jimin, V]
I just wanna be happier
Melt me, I'm cold
I've reached out my hand countless times
The echo is colorless
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself 
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?
[Post-Chorus: Jungkook & Jin, Jimin & V]
I still feel my heart
Breathe faster like when
I walked on the cold winter streets
Don't say you're fine
'Cause you're not
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much

[Verse 2: j-hope, RM]
The road I always walk and the light I always receive
But today seems like an unfamiliar scene
Have I become used to it or have I collapsed?
This piece of metal does feel heavy
A grey rhino approaches
I just stand there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like 'color' embarrass me
The wide grey zone is comfortable
With hundreds of millions of grey faces
When it rains, I dance
Over this city, my world
Raise a toast to
The fog on clear days
And all the dust always
Here with me on rainy days
[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, V, Jin]
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth in my hands
They're cold, that's why I need more of you
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
If I laugh in the future far away
I'll tell you that I did

(SUGA)
It was good in the beginning
Going up and down itself
We become tired before we knew it
Meaningless emotional exhaustion
Repeated seesaw, seesaw game
Now, I'm so sick of this
Repeated seesaw, seesaw game
We're both sick and tired of each other

[Verse 1: SUGA]
Was the small argument the beginning?
The moment I became heavier than you
Because there has never been parallel in the first place
Maybe that's why we tried to reach the balance
If it was love, and if this is what love means
Is there really a need to keep repeating ourselves
It seems we're both tired of each other and holding the same cards
Well, then

[Chorus: SUGA]
All right, a repeated seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, a boring seesaw game
Someone has to get off of this seesaw
I can't, but
[Post-Chorus: SUGA]
Let's not look at each other who will get off first
Let’s not drag things out
Let's follow our hearts
Let's put an end to this
A repeated seesaw game
Let's stop it now

[Verse 2: SUGA]
People can be so crafty
We know someone gets hurt if the other is gone
But neither of us want to be the bad guy
In the midst of a series of vague responsibilities, umm-umm
We became so sick of each other that we finally became parallel
Ay, although this wasn't the kind of parallel that I wanted

[Verse 3: SUGA]
At first, we showed off who was heavier
We bragged and smiled at each other
Now we're trying measure who's heavier
A competition between us
That became a flame, igniting quarrels
It'll only end if someone gets off right here
Acting like we're for each other
With words mixed with thorns
Can't keep doing this, we need to make a decision
[Pre-Chorus: SUGA]
If we didn't have feelings for each other
If we didn't think of each other
Would we have dragged it out like this?
Now if we don't have any feelings left
It's dangerous, dangerous on this seesaw
Stop thinking about me

[Chorus: SUGA]
All right, a repeated seesaw game
It's about time we put an end to it
All right, a boring seesaw game
Someone has to get off of this seesaw
I can't, but

Hol' up, hol' up, I walk on this seesaw you're not on

That faint voice of yours that grazed me
Please call my name one more time
I’m standing still under the frozen light, but
I will walk towards you, step by step
Still with you

[Verse 1]
A pitch dark room
I shouldn’t get used to it
But I’m used to it again
The low-pitched sound of the air conditioner
If I don’t have this, I might just fall apart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We laugh together, we cry together
These simple feelings were everything I had
When will it be?
If I see you again
I will look into your eyes
And say, ""I missed you""

[Chorus]
In a rapturous memory
The rain pours even when I dance alone
By the time this mist clears
I'll run with my feet wet
So hug me then
[Verse 2]
The moon looks lonely
Like it's crying in the bright night sky
Even though I always know the morning will come
I want to stay in your sky like a star

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Every day, every moment
If I knew this was gonna happen
I would have remembered more of them
When will it be?
If I see you again
I will look into your eyes
And say, ""I missed you""

[Chorus]
In a rapturous memory
The rain pours even when I dance alone
By the time this mist clears
I'll run with my feet wet
So hug me then

[Outro]
Behind the faint smile that looked at me
I will draw a beautiful purple shade
Though our footsteps may be out of step
I want to walk this path with you
Still with you34Embed"

Try to cover it

A crack again on this frozen lake
I dumped myself into the lake
I buried my voice for you

A thick ice has formed atop
A winter lake on which I was thrown away
A thick ice has formed
In the dream I shortly went into
My agonizing phantom pain is still the same

Have I lost myself
Or have I gained you
I suddenly run to the lake
There’s my face in it

Please don't say anything
Reach my hand out to cover the mouth
But in the end, spring will come someday
The ice will melt and flow away

Glitter, glitter, looka at my crown glitter
Remember, remember, days gone by remember
We so fly, we so fly, private jets, we so fly
Mmm, uh, born a slave but now a king
Berserk tiger, Gwanghae flow
Born in a ditch but rise up a dragon
That's the way I live
Sorry, but don’t worry
I got lots to lose
Shove the past into a rice chest
I'm about to dine on what I know is mine
Shut up, yeah, mmm you calling me a pup, yeah
I was born as a tiger, at least I'm not a weak like you
Pathetic fucks putting on a talent show
Not gonna lie, what a shitshow
I got no pretensions, just kill ’em all
Ain't no exceptions, I watch you fall
Flexing, I got none, I don't need one
Who's the king, who's the boss?
You all know my name
All shit-talk they got no game
Off with their heads, ah

Hit this town, then cut and run in a jet
This country's too small to hold me in yet, yeah
Woo, who says time is money?
My time is worth more than that
Tic tok, in the face of those Seonbi bastards I spit
Revenues keep going up-up-up-up-up-up and up
Everyday, Bang PD goes dance-dance-dance-dance-dance-dance-dance
I'm so thankful, I'm a genius
That’s your reason for using drugs, cry me a river, you just got no skills
I got everything I wanted, what more will make me feel contented?
I wanted clothes, clothes, then money, money, then goals, goals, now what’s next?
Yeah, what's next? Here comes my reality check, there’s nowhere higher
I only looked up and now I want to look down and put my feet on the ground
I'm a king, I'm a boss
Remember my name

Off with their heads
I'm a king, I’m a boss

The moment I noticed myself
I had to leave
I had to find out
All day all night
Across the desert and the sea
This wide, wide world
I wandered, Baby I

I could make it better
I could hold you tighter
On that long road
Oh you're the light
Uninvited
Unwelcome
The only one who recognized me

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jin, Jimin]
This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning
Can I now hold that hand?
Ooh-ooh, I can make it right

The loud screams that seek me out
My hand, trophy and a gold microphone
All day, everywhere
But all of this is about reaching you
It's the answer to my journey
I'm singing to find you
Baby to you

[Verse 3: RM]
A little taller than I was before
With a voice a little more solid
All of this to go back to you
Now I'll spread wide a map called you
My rehab
Look at me, why can't you recognize me?
I don't want to hear other people's noises
Your fragrance still penetrates and breaks me down
Let's go back to that time

[Refrain: Jin, Jimin]
Baby I know
I can make it better
I can hold you tighter
All those roads
Are pointing to you
Everything was useless
Anything other than you
Just touch me like that time

Just hold me silently like you did that day, that time
The reason I survived in hell
It's for you, it was not for me
If you know, don't hesitate and please save my life
I'm thirsty wandering this desert without you
So hurry and grab me quickly
I know the sea without you is the same as a desert

I feel like I'm floating, both eyes spinning
In this fabulous space, I feel completely shabby

Totally shabby
The world thinks we own the whole world
Even if we have what I wanted in my dreams
Big house, big cars, big rings
The unfamiliar feeling of missing something
For someone who has accomplished everything
But I go out the door since I know I have something to return to

[Bridge: Jin]
I keep remembering you between crossroads
You knew me when I had nothing else
I could smile at the thought of you

Will you open the door for me
When the doorbell rings three times
So that I could give the parting words
That I did not finish

Goodbyes are, for me, a tear
Without even knowing, it blooms around my eyes
The words that I could not bring myself to say flow down
And lingering regret crawls over my face
To me, you were once my dear
But now you're merely a bitter beer
My heart that's stained with belated self-loathing
Becomes empty even with the passing breeze
At the end of my play where breakup was a lie
The price that I had to pay came to me
If someone said they would turn back the time for me
Would I have been able to be a bit more honest?
The bare face that only I know
The ugly and pathetic old friends within me
Would you still be able to love me again like before
With that smile with which you used look at me
Stop saying things like forever, forever
After all, the end originally exists
If there's a start, I don't wanna listen to that
Words that are too correct or too much consolation
I don't wanna listen to that
I was just so scared
Because it seemed like perhaps I had never loved you at all
Although it was late, that you were true
That only you loved me more
[Refrain: RM]
You're my tear, you're my you're my tear (Yeah)
You're my tear, you're my you're my tear (Yeah)
You're my tear, you're my you're my tear (Yeah)
What more can I say? You're my tear

[Chorus: j-hope, SUGA]
We walked towards the same place (Ayy, ayy)
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever (Ayy, ayy)
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream (Ayy, ayy)
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

[Refrain: RM, SUGA, j-hope]
(Oh) You're my tear, you're my you're my tear
(Ae-yeah) You're my tear, you're my you're my tear
(Ae-yeah) You're my fear, you're my you're my fear
(Ae-yeah) What more can I say? You're my…

[Verse 2: SUGA]
Yeah, goodbyes are T.E.A.R because things like tears are a luxury
There's no such thing as beautiful goodbyes, so just begin now
Ooh, take it easy, slowly carve out my heart
That's right, that’s right, gently step on the shards that have shattered
So that regret, regret, such a thing will no longer be left
Please burn up my heart that was torn into shreds
That's right, right there, what are you hesitating for
This is the ending you were wishing for
So go on and kill me without hesitating
(Ooh) Ayy, yeah, yeah, burn it
(Ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah, burn it
(Ooh) Yeah, yeah, yeah, burn it
So not even the ashes remain
[Pre-Chorus: SUGA]
This is the real you and this is the real me
Now we've seen the end and not even resentment is left
I've woken up from the sweet dream and I close my eyes
This is the real you and this is the real me

[Chorus: RM, SUGA]
We walked towards the same place (Ayy, ayy)
But this place becomes our last
Although we used to talk about forever (Ayy, ayy)
Now we break each other without mercy
Although we thought that we dreamed the same dream (Ayy, ayy)
That dream has finally become a dream
My heart is torn, please burn it instead
So that pain and regret, none of that would be left

(Ae-yeah) You're my tear, you're my you're my tear
(Ae-yeah) You're my fear, you're my you're my fear
(Ae-yeah) What more can I say? You're my…

[Bridge: SUGA]
What should I say?
We know
The answer is fixed
But replying is always hard
[Verse 6: j-hope]
Why are you spilling it? Why are you tearing it up?
It's useless, to me goodbye to me is only those moments (Flashback)
The moment you say words from your mouth
The moment our focus becomes irregular
At the moment where everything is dangerous
Our end that two letters handed to us
That I won't cry, that I won't tear it up
I can't say those kinds of words. In the future I, too
Breakup, incurable disease
You're my beginning and my end, that is all
My meeting and my farewell
You were everything, step forward fear
It will be repeated, caused by you, tear, tear44Embed"

Rage? Of course you need it
When it burns up there's always a reason
Mayhaps it’s our history
Sometimes it changes the world
But this is not rage, this is excretion
Which one is rage, you know?
Pretending it's rage and killing, real rage
Fed up, the countless number of people

It seems that nobody can live without rage
Raging, again raging, and raging
Going insane, like UGH! UGH! UGH! UGH!
There are tens of thousands of reasons to be raging
Good will and evil will, all the very same
I can rage, but if there were to be damage done
To others' lives, I don't like
That’s stop, ayy

Someone becomes gloomy at someone's speech and behaviour
Someone's spur of the moment becomes someone's moment

Mm, uh-oh

[Verse 1: j-hope]
Uh, it looks like I lost something
I relieve my anxiety with a sip of coffee
An endless rest
Happiness suddenly comes towards me uncomfortably
24 hours, that’s plenty of time
I could sleep all day but there’s still no problem
I think I should work till my body breaks
I’m the damn guy who eats three meals a day
My crime, the dog bit me while I was resting
Scream “Don’t do that,” but I’m depending on results every day
E'r'yday do my thang, damn if I fail
Keep growling, tap a rotten rope
Insecurity, this is a disease
The physical stuff is a stun from work, ow!

[Pre-Chorus: V, Jung Kook, Jin, Jimin]
Maybe
I'm sick, yeah, becausе I think too much
I hate that
I’m childish but not that simple
I’m just young, only my body’s grown
Limping all my life
Onе for the laugh, two for the show
Just like I'm so fine

Every day I comfort myself
They're all the same people, ain't so special
Ay man keep one, two step

Dis-dis-dis-disease
Throw away
My fe-fe-fe-fear

[Verse 2: RM]
RM, yeah
Even our hearts need a vacation
Oh, just do your job like it's one
I'm ill, yeah, I'm the job itself
The friend called ‘rest,’ oh, I never liked him
How much do you have to earn to be happy?
This glass bottle hits your head
Is the world sick or am I sick? I’m confused
I take off my glasses, but the dark doesn't blur
Whatever label is attached to me after this time
I hope they’ll all be you
Your you, you
[Verse 3: SUGA]
Everyone has a lot of diseases, what I’m confused
Is that mankind is inherently evil
There more than 400 kinds of mental diseases
But no one really fits into any of these categories
Yo, is the world sick or am I sick?
Or do we just interpret things differently?
Or is that all to it?
I don’t know, changing myself is faster
Than looking at people differently

[Pre-Chorus: Jin, Jimin, Jung Kook, V]
Maybe
I'm sick, yeah, because I think too much
I hate that
I’m childish but not that simple

But I don’t wanna mess up
'Cause life goes on

And trust my old self again
Now wake up one more time

Let's go for it, one more night
No one knows what'll be at the end, ayy
Woo, no night lasts forever

Is this love

Sometimes I don't
The next lyrics, um
What should I write, um

But none of them feel how I feel
I just feel it
Like the moon rises after the sun rises
Like how fingernails grow
Like trees that shed their bark once a year
That you are the one who will give meaning to my memories
Who will make a 'person' into 'love'
Before I knew you
My heart was filled with straight lines only

I'm just a human, human, human
You erode all my corners
And make me into love, love, love
We're humans, humans, humans
In that myriad of straight lines

You make live to a love

Fuck, JKLMNOPQRST

You erode all my edges
And make me into love, love, love

Life's long so take it slow

The end is filled with a paradise of dreams

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jimin & Jungkook]
But the real world is
Different from what's promised
We need to run, we need to step on it
If you shoot a flare
You don't have a destination
There's no sceneries at all
Until your breath comes up to your chin
You need to you need to

There's no need to run without even knowing the reason

It's alright to stop
Now we don't run without knowing the destination
It's alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

We borrow dreams from others (Like a debt)
We learn that we need to become great (Like a light)
Your dream is actually a burden
If having a future is the only dream existing
Then what is the dream you had last night in your bed?
It's alright if the name of the dream is different
Be it buying a laptop next month
Or just eating and sleeping
Not doing anything at all yet still having a lot of money
Who says a dream must be something grand
Just become anybody
We deserve a life
Whatever big or small, you are you after all

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jimin & Jungkook]
But the real world is
Different from what's promised
We need to run, we need to step on it
If you shoot a flare
You don't have a destination
There's no sceneries at all
Until your breath comes up to your chin
You need to you need to

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, V, Jimin]
It's alright to stop
There's no need to run without even knowing the reason
It's alright to not have a dream
If you have moments where you feel happiness for a while
It's alright to stop
Now we don't run without knowing the destination
It's alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise
[Verse 3: Suga]
I don't have a dream
To dream is sometimes scary
To just live like this
To survive like this is a small dream to me
To have a dream, to grasp a dream
To breathe, is sometimes too much to handle
Saying this person's living like this, that person's living like that
The world's hurling at me

[Verse 4: J-Hope]
Yeah
The world doesn't have the right to swear
What is the way to dream a dream
Since they never taught us that
In the made up dream, sleep-talk of tears
I wake you up from the nightmare for you
Now let's try to smile everyday, in that paradise

[Chorus: V, Jimin]
It's alright to stop
Now we don't run without even knowing the destination
It's alright to not have a dream
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise

[Bridge: All]
Stop runnin' for nothin' my friend
Now stop that foolish race
Stop runnin' for nothin' my friend
All the breaths you breathe are already in paradise
Stop runnin' for nothin' my friend
You don't need something like a dream that everyone dreams
Stop runnin' for nothin' my friend
Every language that makes you, is already in paradise22Embed"

Grab it like a bonga
She took a pill that made her horny
She fucks in the Audi, not in the Honda, ayy (Tra)
If I give it to you, don't call me (Tra)
'Cause this is not to make you love me, ayy (Tra)
If your boyfriend doesn't eat your ass
He better fuck off

And you were actually thinking about it!

Oh, sure, you’re there to make them
But will you be there to raise them, too?

Or at least au naturel –
Stop, I know you’re lying

The whole world, concert so sick
From Asiana Asia
You could be my new thang
I'm different from the hyungs
That ignore their duties
An uprising of celebrities
Damn only strong ones can mess with me
Some think it was easy for me to reach my position
Fuck you, I'm the thorn in the eyes of those hyungs
Who have no chances of becoming successful
To be honest, Ssaihanuwar is embarrassing
Now I sell 500,000 copies a year
I'm too big to fit in the k-pop category, whoo
Right, if you want to go ahead
Try reserving first class
My seat is business
Yours is economy, forever behind me kissing my ass
Next target is Billboard
Brazil to New York
My busy passport

The racquet caused by the jealous hyungs
Who are scared I'd take away
Their source of income with my fame
Hey ho I don't give a shit
When you're busy being a moron
I will simply bury you alive in the grave
You dug out yourself
Hey ho you can't handle me
You wasted rappers should be grateful
That I'm an idol

I still orbit you, and nothing’s changed
If love has no name, everything has changed

I turned my head around and saw you

Filled with monochrome coldness

Look far into the distance
The place you gave me is still
Where my heart entrusts

Shadows of the past keep on chasing me
But the more I try to escape and struggle, the more it follows
But I still want to hold onto it, wherever you are I'll find you
To a tomorrow of us
[Pre-Chorus: Jimin]
Even it seems to be the beginning of the end
I’ll call your name

[Chorus: V, Jin]
The gazing eyes are so colorful
I'll give my everything to you
Still unable to verbalize
The hopeless dream in my heart

To face the past and the future
How much hope is needed to reach you
It's nights like these that I keep on thinking
In the city at dusk

To be loved
To love someone
I'll become your eye
For the adventure that lies ahead

That someday the sadness
Will wind us together

That's how it's supposed to be
Yeah, all this pain and all these sorrows
That's our destiny, see?
You and my life was like this
We gotta dance in the rain, dance in the pain
Even though we crash down
We gon' dance in the plane
We need the night's scenery more than anyone else
Only I can console myself, nobody else
It's okay to shed the tears
But don't you tear yourself

When moon rise, it's your time

I left, but can never get to leave once
You say you wanna die, but live it much harder
You say you wanna let go but put on another weight
Thinking of not thinking at all is still thinking, you know
Actually this is our destiny, you know
Smiling in endless pain, you know
There is no 'freedom' when you say ""freedom"" out loud, you know
Do you know?

[Verse 3]
In the moon hours, look at the night sky through the eyes of your soul
Gonna show it to you, your window, your time
You know, there's a lot of thorns on that streetlight too
Look closely at that blinking light for once
Isn't a night view such a cruel thing?
A magnificent sight of somebodies' thorns
Someone will be consoled by looking at your thorns for sure

I wanna be the king
I wanna go win
I wanna be
I wanna be a rap star

I wanna be a rockstar
I want it all mine
I wanna be rich
I wanna be the king
I wanna be me
I want a big thing
Oh boy let me see
I got a big dream yeah

[Verse 1: SUGA]
Ooh, I wondered everyday how far I'd go
I came to my senses and I find myself here
Yeah, hmm, shadow at my feet
Look down, it's gotten even bigger
I run but the shadow follows, as dark as the light's intense
I'm afraid, flying high is terrifying
No one told me how lonely it is up here
I can leap in the air but also plunge, now I know
Running away could be an option too, pause
[Pre-Chorus: SUGA]
People say, there's splendor in that bright light
But my growing shadow swallows me and becomes a monster
Up high, high, and higher, higher
I only go higher and vertigo overtakes me
I rise, rise, I hate it
I pray, I pray, hoping to be okay

[Chorus: SUGA]
The moment I'm flying high as I wished
My shadow grows in that blasting stark light
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm afraid
The moment I face myself brought lowest
It so happens that I'm flying the highest
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm scared
Don't let me shine

[Verse 2: SUGA]
Try smiling, what are you hesitating for?
Wasn't this the kind of thing you were hoping for?
Or cry instead, what are you scared of?
Wasn't this the kind of thing you'd been wanting?
The life you hoped for, the life you wanted
The life you chose, you achieved everything without regrets
And on top of that, you have a big house, big cars, big rings
All the things you wanted, you've got it all
So what's the problem? Just enjoy it
Or just let it go, no? Then run, or stop
Don't whine, just choose one or the other
[Pre-Chorus: SUGA]
You're saying I never told you that? (Yeah, yeah)
You're asking me if I really didn't know? (Oh no)
I'll simply take just as much as you own, whatever it is
That at times, your rest becomes your fall
Do you finally get it? That giving it your best effort every time is what it means to do your best

[Chorus: SUGA]
The moment I'm flying high as I wished
My shadow grows in that blasting stark light
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm afraid
The moment I face myself brought lowest
It so happens that I'm flying the highest
Please don't let me shine
Don't let me down, don't let me fly
Now I'm scared
Don't let me shine

On the other side of the famous idol rapper
Stands my weak self, it’s a bit dangerous
Depression, OCD
They keep coming back again from time to time
Hell no perhaps that might be my true self
Damn huh feeling estranged in reality
The conflict with ideal, my head hurts
Around the age of 18, I developed social anxiety
Right, that was when my mind was gradually polluted

[Verse 2]
At times I’m scared of myself too
Thanks to the depression that takes over me
And all my self hatred
Min Yoongi is dead already (I killed him)
Comparing my dead passion with others
It’s now a part of my daily life

[Verse 3]
On the first visit to psychiatric ward
My parents came up with me
We listened to the consultation together
My parents said they don’t truly understand me
I don’t understand myself well either
Then who would understand?
Friends? Or you? Nobody knows me well
[Bridge]
The doctor asks me if I've (censored)
I answered without any hesitation that I have

[Hook 1]
Habitual saying uh
I don’t give a shit I don’t give a fuck
All those words uh
Those words are said to hide my weak self
Those days I wish I could erase
Right, that performance day
Which I don’t remember very well
The day I confronted myself
When I hid inside the bathroom
Because I was scared of people

[Verse 4]
That time I, that time I
I thought success would make everything fine
But you see, but you see
As time goes by, I feel like I’m turning into a monster

[Verse 5]
I’ve exchanged my youth for success
And that monster demands for more wealth
At times it puts a collar on my neck
To ruin and swallow me with greed
Some try to shut my mouth and say
I should swallow this forbidden fruit
I don’t want it
They want me to leave this garden
[Verse 6]
Shit shit I got it so stop it
I’m the root of all this so I’ll stop myself
If my misfortune is your happiness
I’ll happily stay unfortunate
If I’m the figure of hate
I’ll get on the guillotine

[Verse 7]
The things I’ve only imagined turns into reality
My childhood dreams are in front of my eyes
The night when I performed in front of an audience of 2
Now Tokyo Dome is right in front my nose
My one and only life
I can easily live it passionately than any other
My fan my hommie my fam
I hope you don’t worry
Because I’m really okay now damn

[Verse 8]
I’ve denied my nature many times
My address is idol and I won’t deny
The anguish that dug into my mind countless times
There’s no answer at the end of wandering

[Verse 9]
My pride which I thought I had given away
Has turned into self-respect
My fans, keep your head high with pride
Because who can do it like me uh
[Hook]
Seiko, Rolex, AX hall and gymnastic stadium
The heads of thousands nodding to my hand gesture
Show me the money
It’s not that I couldn’t but I didn’t shit

[Verse 10]
Selling ourselves or not
You all say we couldn’t do it but we didn’t shit
The root of my creativity has tasted
The sweet, bitter, and shit of this world
Those days when I tried to sleep on the toilet floor
It’s all memories now uh they’re now memories
My shoulder which shattered
Thanks to the accident I met
During my part time job
The debut which I clung as if it was my life
Who do you think you’re fooling
By pretending you’ve gone through all the miseries

[Hook]
Seiko, Rolex, AX hall and gymnastic stadium
The heads of thousands nodding to my hand gesture
Sorrow created me uh look at me closely uh
Selling ourselves or not you all say

All the angels who know pain
Flying on damaged wings through the night
Every time I'm thinking about love

I don't wanna listen to just happy songs
I'll face my loneliness, color my life
Losing and gaining, but I'm still searching for something today

Yeah I believe that things will change
No one is perfect
Even this moment has its own meaning

I never thought there'd be a sleepless night
Turns out they weren't lies
And it made me get stronger
What is love? If there's an answer, I wanna know right now
I'm breaking down I can see there's light inside
Dawn will come to the darkest of nights
Overcome, even the future
We won't stop from now on
Decide for yourself what it means to be happy
Every day, take a step to grow up

But it's okay sometimes
To show weakness
It's okay to be you
Don't lie to yourself any more
Everything connects by sound, woah

I walk in pace, moderately wearing down

And the world strips me naked

We are the children of the moon

But you can open your eyes for now
Just like that movie, like the line (from the movie)

Because of who?
Because of women

[Verse 1: RM]
Thank you for your existence
Please call me so that I can buy you dinner
I'm crazy crazy these days, cough cough
Girls, you make me cough, your clothes, they’re see-through, see-through
(Very much) thank you! You make me see everything clear
(Natural LASIK) I don't need to pay for it
I'll be in panic, I'll be a fan
And I'll be a man of you you you you babe

[Verse 2: Jung Kook]
It keeps catching my eyes, girls' tummies, yup
Girls are equations and we solve it, yup
I drip with sweat and don't know what to do
Please wear more high heels, heels
I’m 18, I know all that stuff
That girls are the best creatures in the world
Yes, I'm a bad boy, so I like bad girl
Come on baby, we are meant to be
[Chorus: V, RM, Jung Kook, Jimin]
Hello, hello (What?)
Hello, hello (What?)
Tell me what you want right now
Hello, hello (What?)
Hello, hello (What?)
I'ma give it to you, girl, right now
You are not mine but I know you are perfect
In front of you, I don't even know where to look
I want to get closer to you but you are just too beautiful

[Post-Chorus: Jungk Kook, V, Jin]
Girls are the best
Presents, presents
What I'm really wishing for is
Just you, just you
(Everybody say)
If that's you, I'm ok
Oh I can't handle this
You look perfect in every direction
From head to toe, perfect, perfect

Even the way they walk, it's perfect perfect
[Verse 3: SUGA]
No way, not only for once or twice
I’m not interested in that short time period relationship
But I learn body Architecture 101 from you
My testosterone goes up heavily
After conquering at a fight with my hormone
I studied you and found out you were against the rules, foul
If the standards for beauty can be compared with the depth of the sea, you are the deep sea
You are the beautiful cultural heritage and should be conserved by government

[Verse 4: j-hope]
From her head, body, waist, legs to where I cannot really say
As a man, I cannot understand if someone says he's not interested
Even a small gesture blows my mind
Girl, I keep my place in front of my computer every night because you are luring me
Lady's first for my lady
Girls are the frozen icebergs? Let it go
Female, it's madness. It excites me everyday
I squeeze my pimple after this hormone war as part of my daily routine

[Chorus: Jin, RM, Jung Kook, Jimin]
Hello, hello (What?)

Tell me what you want right now

They don't know what I'm talking about
Clothes are dirty, bro, of mud
Cig's yellow in between the fingers
I'm walking with a cig
Pardon me, but I really do believe
That I can make this jump
And even if the street is uphill
I'm training for this now

[Verse 2]
And good evening, ladies and gentlemen
Bring out the actors
You better hold on to your balls
You better keep quiet and be good
Here people are weird, like drug dealers
Too many nights I've spent locked outside
Now I'm kicking these doorways
Staring up like climbers
So sorry mum if I'm always out, but

[Chorus]
I am out of my mind, but I'm not like the others
And you are out of your mind, but you're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others
[Verse 3]
I've written pages and pages
I've seen salt, then tears
These men in cars
Don't climb the rapids
I've written on a tombstone
""In my house there's no God""
But if you find time's meaning
You'll climb back up from your oblivion
And there's no wind stopping
The natural power
From the right point of view
You feel the intoxication of the wind
With wax wings on your back
I'll go look for that altitude
If you wanna stop me try again
Try cutting my head off
Because

[Chorus]
I am out of my mind, but I'm not like the others
And you are out of your mind, but you're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others
We are out of our minds, but we're not like the others

Unfortunately people talk
They talk, they don't know what they talk about
Bring me where I float
Cause I lack air here

Cause I lack air here

Oh, ah, yeah

[Verse 1: Rap Monster]
I just started walking and ended up at the sea
I'm looking at the coast from here
There's endless sand and the rough wind
I'm still looking at a desert
I wanted to have the sea so I swallowed you up
But I'm even thirstier than before
Is what I know really the ocean?
Or a blue desert?

[Verse 2: Suga]
I thought this was the ocean but it's a desert
A medium-sized, ordinary idol was my second name
Countless people get cut from broadcast
But someone's empty spot is our dream
They say some of these kids can't make it cuz their agency is too small
I know, I know, I know too
Times when the seven of us had to sleep in one room
With foolish hope that tomorrow will be different before we fell asleep
We saw the mirage in the desert but we couldn't grasp it
Praying that we'll remain in this desert till the end
Praying that this isn't truly our reality
[Verse 3: Suga]
In the end, we reached the mirage and it became our reality
The scary desert became the ocean with our blood, sweat and tears
But why is there this fear in between the happiness?
Because we know too well that this place is really a desert

[Refrain 2: Suga]
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna rest
No, who cares if we rest a little?
No no no
I don't wanna lose
It's always a desert
I told you everything
Then I'll just be more depressed

Long for love even though it hurts every time (Love)

Get hurt and break down, I
Don't know what's making me hold on
If I leave anyway, I'll hate you in my pained state
We can't end it before it's over
It's as if we've been waiting for this agony

But I don't care, I'll do it over and over
I just need you in my life

No love, never, my exes know
No diamond rings, that set in stone

Love is a drug that I quit
No doctor could help when I'm lovesick

I don't know why life outrages me (No)
Thinking of taking a shortcut
I met someone but I don't know, I never fit
Unless it's you (You, you, you, you)
Baby, I love you even if I say otherwise
I've been alone for six months, but
[Bridge]
Today I went out with the boys to drink (Haha)
And I said that I wasn't going to talk about you (No, no, no)
It's five o'clock, dawn is coming (Ku-ku-ku-ku)
If they don't turn on, I'm going to call her
Today I went out with the boys to drink (Ey, ey)
And I said that I wasn't going to talk about you (No-no, no-no)
It's five o'clock, dawn is coming (Ku-ku-ku-ku)
If they don't turn on, I'm going to call her

[Chorus]
I still love you (I love you)
But I know it's a mistake (Is not done, no)
Because you don't love me anymore (No, no)
And without you, I do better (Juju)
And if I see your mom, hey (Mommy)
I ask her about you (Ehm, okay)
To see if you already have someone
Someone that makes you happy

I walk above the clouds
Tell me about eternity just one more time
When you say that you love me

That you'll never change, just one more time

And you can't make it nothing (Nothing)

Even though I haven't seen my limits
But if it exists, It's probably you
I wanted to be the tender waves
But why didn't I know you were the sea?
What do I do?
I speak with your language
And I breathe in your air
I'll be you, I'll be in your grasp
As I kiss your sword
So take my hand right now
I don't believe that I'm like this
The words I've said to myself a million times
Please don't leave me, ooh-woah

Only the fact that you're by my side (Thanks)

Your everything has lost its eternal tomorrow
And now it's wandering around eternally
Along with me
Who was unable to say goodbye or move on from you

Or maybe it's some kind of curse
Hey, I'm still holding on to my thoughts
Hey, what kind of tomorrow
Should I look for in this town?

The cold tears that fall
Freeze under the sky
They're just pretending to be kind
As they fall down my face

That's all there is to this story

Trapped in a maze of decisions
Exhausted by all the different chaos
We’ve wandered around, looking for the answer
Lost in the maze, in the darkness

[Verse 2: Jungkook]
We ran and ran endlessly
But all the fake noise
Can’t tear us apart
It’s true baby

[Refrain: Jimin, Jin]
We must believe only in ourselves
Can’t let go of each other’s hands
We need to be together forever

[Verse 3: RM]
People say
That I’ll end up a fool
But I don’t wanna use my head
I don’t wanna calculate
Love ain’t a business
Rather like a fitness
I’ve never been in a calculating love
I know it’ll be cold like winter
But I still wanna try
If you push me, I’ll fall, just raise me up again
Even if I pull, you don’t have to come
Let them be them
Let us be us

But you is amaze yeah

All around us is a maze, different paths
We’re walking in this abyss
There’s a thin light over there
I hope we’re going toward paradise
Know this, sometimes lies will try to tear us apart
Hardships will try to deceive us but
Just focus on me then
In the darkness, just the two of us is enough
In all these lies
If we’re together, even an endless maze is paradise
[Chorus: Jin]
Take my ay ay hand, don’t let go
Lie ay ay in this maze
My ay ay never lose me

[Verse 5: J-Hope]
What can we do? We did the official thing
So we need to follow the rules
Even in this wandering maze
Even on this mysterious path
We’re taking care of each other
I always think, even if eternity is hard
I wanna try it, let’s be forever
Our own mountain, our own climb
Our own world, our own heart
Travel toward the exit
Held together, our hands become a map

At the end there might be something
Special life, ordinary life, each in its own way
What's good is good, in the end

Discomfort is something everyone has to withstand
The repetition of dramatic situations can make your life exhausting
People are like that
When you’re not there, you want to be there, and when you are, you don’t want to
Who said people are animals of wisdom?
For me, obviously, we are animals of regret

There is nothing permanent in the world
Everything is just a happening passing through

Like you were wrapped in fragile air
You had a lonely gaze

[Pre-Chorus]
In the world always ringing with ""tick-tocks,"" again and again
Touching the heartless words and loud voices
Even if tears are about to spill
If it were the two of us together
I'm sure mundane happiness could be found

[Chorus]
In the troubling days, for the never-smiling you
I give my utmost love in hopes for the dazzling tomorrow
In the never ending night before we fall
Come and take my hand
Even the days that you hid inside, wanting to forget
It'll melt with the warmth of my embraces
No need to be afraid, until dawn comes someday
Let's be together
[Verse 2]
I hate it when you stare at the things only you can see
Like you're captivated by it, or you're in love
I hate that expression

[Pre-Chorus]
The things I want to believe but I can't no matter what I do
They'll repeatedly appear, and every time, I'll get angry and cry
Even so, some day we'll surely, we'll understand each other
I believe in it

[Bridge]
""I don't want this, I'm tired of it""
I frantically reach for your hand
But you push my hands away
""I don't want this, I'm tired of it""
To tell the truth, I want to say that, too

[Pre-Chorus]
In the world always ringing with ""tick-tocks,"" again and again
None of the words I've prepared for you reached you
""I want to end it all""
When I went along and said that
You smiled for the first time

[Key-Change]
In the troubling days, I became unable to smile
The reflection of you in my eyes is truly beautiful
The overflowing tears on the never-ending night
All dissolve into your smile
[Chorus]
In the never-changing days when I cried
You seduce me with your tenderness towards the end
Just like I'm about to sink, just like I'm about to melt
The staining fog dissipates
In the days that I hide inside, wanting to forget
I take your hand as you extend it towards me
It's like the cold breeze is swimming through the sky
Blowing through us

[Outro]
Don't ever let go of my hand
The both of us, racing into the night3Embed"

On the day when I laughed hard
Why is the night darker?
It keeps bringing me down
Down, down
Hmm, the words that everyone said so easily
Maybe you can hear it soon
I've heard enough I've heard enough
Of the things that I'm not

[Pre-Chorus: Rosé]
Even if the whole world changes
I'm still the same
I dreamed of this path I walked
As it was then, as it was then
The first time I danced every day
I was left there

[Chorus: Jennie, Jisoo, both]
But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoеs
You'll never know, my tangled strings
'Causе everybody sees what they wanna see
It's easier to judge me than to believe
The old thoughts I hid deeply
Sometimes grabbing me and tormenting me
The more I do, I'ma shine, baby
You know they ain't got a shot on me
[Verse 2: Lisa, Jennie]
Sunday night, I've been swallowed by my bed
I've been all over my head
Wonderin' if I gotta try and pretend
I don't know what day it is
I'm afraid I'll find myself hoping to know
The brighter that light gets
My shadow is getting longer
When it's too dazzling
Will I be able to see behind you?

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo]
Even if the whole world changes
I'm still the same
I dreamed of this path I walked
As it was then, as it was then
The first time I danced every day
I was left there

[Chorus: Rosé, Jennie, Jennie & Jisoo]
But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes
You'll never know, my tangled strings
'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see
It's easier to judge me than to believe
The old thoughts I hid deeply
Sometimes grabbing me and tormenting me
The more I do, I'ma shine, baby
You know they ain't got a shot on me
[Bridge: Lisa, Rosé, Jennie]
You can't sink, I know well
I can't fly while looking at the ground
Across the clouds, it's still bright
I've been drawing in the picture
Even in the torn places
So I can empty everything and laugh
I wanna face me, who I didn't want to see, eh
I remember, so I'll be okay
Make flowers bloom in my blue room
I'll always be waiting

[Chorus: Rosé, Jisoo, Jennie & Jisoo]
But you'll never know unless you walk in my shoes
You'll never know, my tangled strings
'Cause everybody sees what they wanna see
It's easier to judge me than to believe

Wonderful, wonderful
You were wonderful, I was so pathetic
We were wonderful
Wonderful
You were wonderful, I was so pathetic

[Verse 1]
Hey baby, oops, Miss
I’m not gonna hit on you, I swear
I’ve been single since yesterday, fuck!
I can’t have a baby but well, it’s not –
Hey, come back!
Just five minutes, I didn’t insult you
I’m polite, respectful and a very bit wasted
You’re not gonna wanna talk to a guy like me, huh
If you’d only seen me yesterday
I was …

[Chorus]
Wonderful, wonderful
You were wonderful, I was so pathetic
We were wonderful
Wonderful
You were wonderful, I was so pathetic

[Verse 2]
Look at you, checking yourself out
You think you’re hot stuff ‘cause you’re married
But it’s just a ring dude, don’t get carried away
She’s gonna dump you like they always do
And what about the other chick, you mention her?
If you want I’ll tell your wife and then it’s settled
And the kid, too, well, if you got any
Just wait 3 years, 7 years and you’ll see
If it’s …

Hey little girl, oh sorry, boy
You know in life, there’s no good guys or bad guys
If mommy’s being a pain, it’s ‘cause she’s afraid of becoming a granny
If daddy is cheating on mommy, it’s ‘cause she’s getting old
Hey! Why are you blushing? Get back here, kid
And why are you all looking at me like an ape?
Yeah right, you’re all saints
Bunch of monkeys
Give me a baby ape
He’ll be…

Yeah yeah
Yeah just one, day one night

[Verse 1: Suga]
If only I had just one day
I want to peacefully fall asleep intoxicated with your sweet scent
If there’s a chance in my busy schedule
I want to put my body in your warm and deep eyes
I like that, your long, straight hair
Your breathtaking neck when you
Put it up and the strands that fall out
Wherever we go
My handbag is your waist
Yo ma honey
Whenever I see you I run out of breath like the streets of Myungdong
Our BGM is the sound of breathing
Your voice when you say my name
I wanna be locked in you and swim in you
I want to know you more, an explorer venturing through your deep forest of mystery
I appreciate the masterpiece that is you because your existence alone is art
I imagine this all night every day
Because it’s a meaningless dream anyway

[Chorus: Jungkook]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together
[Post-Chorus: All, Jin, J-Hope, Jimin, V]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you

[Verse 2: V, RM]
If only I could do that, how nice would it be
If only we could go anywhere
To eat and watch a movie comfortably
I would do anything girl
I’m sorry
Maybe I’m too rational
But still, if you see me someday, smile
Maybe you resent me a little or no, a lot
I know, I couldn’t look at you more because of my dream
Then just give me one day
Even if it’s in my dream, just one day
Out of all those words I had to swallow
Because of the excuse of reality
I’ll pick one and tell it to you for sure
Let’s meet when the morning glory blooms
And part when they wither
I didn’t think I’d get over you easily but
Is it selfish of me to hope you are the same?
I’m still lying, saying that it’s all for you
You are standing in the center of my life
[Chorus: Jungkook, V]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)

[Bridge: J-Hope]
If you are and I are together, let’s go time
24 hours, if I could only be with you
I’d kiss you starting from the morning
Can’t forget to grab some brunch
I’d hold your hand and soak up the sun
It’s not over yet, in the middle of a beautiful night
I’ll confess to you, with the moon as our light
All of these things tell me
“If I have just one day, it’s possible”

[Chorus: Jungkook, Jin, Jimin & Jin]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

[Post-Chorus: V, Jimin, J-Hope, Jungkook]
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
Having a party party with only you
(Do it do it do it)
I hope I can be with you for just one day
(Do it do it do it)
A party party with only you
[Outro: Jungkook, Jimin, RM]
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day, if I can hold your hands
Just one day, if I can be with you
Just one day (just one day)
If only we can be together

Can you please stay with me?6Embed"
