Remy Boyz, yah-ah
1738, ayy

[Refrain]
I'm like ""Hey, what's up? Hello"" (Ayy)
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in the door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
At 56 a gram, 5 a hundred grams though
Man, I swear I love her, how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans, though
In love with the money, I ain't never lettin' go

[Chorus]
And I get high with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies
[Verse 1]
I'm like, ""Hey, what's up? Hello""
I hit the strip with my trap queen, 'cause all we know is bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a Lamb'
I just might snatch her a necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't wantin' for nothin' because I got her everything
It's big ZooWap from the bando
Remind me where I can't go
Remy Boyz got the stamp though
Count up hella them bands though
Boy how far can your bands go?
Fetty Wap, I'm livin' 50 thousand K how I stand though
If you checkin' for my pockets I'm like…

[Chorus]
And I get high with my baby (My baby)
I just left the mall, I'm gettin' fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby (My baby)
I be in the kitchen cookin' pies with my baby, yeah

Okay she bad and she know it
And she don't ever ask for bread, cause she know I'mma throw it
Ain't gotta ask her if its wet, cause I know its the ocean
And right after we sex, I don't leave I just hold her
I don't leave I just hold her
I treat my girl like a Queen, she gets whatever she needs
And when I tell her I'm hungry she says ""Boy get on your knees""
Go to work, girl I feast, take me away from the streets
Cause she got just what I need, she my drug, I'm a fiend, yeah
I even see her up in my dreams, yeah
Counting money while you rolling my weed
And all I ask is her loyalty, yeah
And she can get whatever she want from me, yeah

You are so damn fine
I'm so damn glad you're mine
And you stay on my mind
I think about you all the damn time

You are so damn fine
I'm so damn glad you're mine

Tellin' you guys how I feel man...

[Hook]
When you wake up in the mornin', ayy
Mom's yellin' in your room
Like can I get 5 more minutes?
Shit, I ain't really trippin' over school
Let's get Wiz Khalifa high and
Get meditated over medicated
Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it, ayy

Get Wiz Khalifa high and
Throw your caps in the air like you know you made it

[Verse]
I told moms I ain't trippin' over school cause I made it
Said, ""Boy you got a son, supposed to be his inspiration""
Put a milli' in his bank account
Don't leave him out I was thinkin'
I'll never do him wrong like they did the operation
Took a nigga's vision from him, was a mothafuckin' baby
Said a couple years later they can give it back to me
Technology is movin' too slow, I'm waitin' patiently
Shit, I don't want it no more, this how I'm meant to be
Remember young kids in the school used to laugh at him
Guess I played my numbers real good, check the mathematics
Niggas broke and Zoovie Zoo up, why they mad at him?
Man I bought about 12 cars just to blast past 'em
Switch cars so much, they don't know which one to blast at
And my bitch so bad and you know her ass fat
Wanna ride through and they is who I'll laugh at
Zoo Gang my crew, won't put nothin' past that

I pull up in my beamer, hop out and start to flexing
Used to stay in the trap house, was serving fiends their breakfast
All I do is count money, my lil brother stretch it
Don’t get shit on my hands now, my shit’s too fucking special
Big ZooWap from the bando, I’m sending you a message
Everything that I land on, I swear to God I smash it
And my whole damn camp on, I heat it up and pass it
Every beat that I Wap on, I put it in a casket
Hit the gas on my spaceship, I hate waiting in traffic
Like they all at a standstill, watch ZooWap fucking pass ‘em
Khaos pull out that forty, he doing too much yapping
I am GMOB, we folk can get it cracking
How you stand on your block without your pistol, boy you lacking
Pillow talk to them bitches bout me, boy I find out faster
How you stand on your block without your pistol, boy you lacking
Pillow talk to them bitches bout me, I find out faster, ay

Bands all in my Robin jeans, niggas tryna rob me
Fuck nigga better duck ‘fore I get the tommy
Riding in the drop top with a mami
Hundred bands I’ma drop soon on my time piece
Tints all on my beamer boy, ZooWap I’m so special
Came up off of nothing, now it’s money in my dresser
Only jeans I rock got wings, five hundred just to dress up
Stupid loud in the woods, ZooWap roll it faster
Had to check my fucking six, I floor it, it go faster
ZooWap from the trap, I swear my sack is a disaster
Different color twelve, twelve skinnies in a plastic
You gon' need a fucking phantom if you tryna match it
Gritt and Dice on twenty-eight, trapping out the mansion
Old school days, Box Chevy for my grandma
All I wanna do is whip, put ZooWap on the landmark
Thru these streets I’m movin' quick like big ZooWap a landshark
Talking shit, can’t leave your block
That’s how you get your land marked
Heavy cheese, my neck gon' freeze and Gucci Mane my role model
Every time I hit the club, we pop at least ‘bout four bottles
Every time we leave the club, you see all the hoes follow
If that nigga acting crazy, he gon' get the whole hollow
ZooWap, I don’t give a fuck, got sympathy for nobody
All they gotta do is cut the check, I go get four Robins
ZooWap I’m the motherfucking best, compared to nobody
Laser tips will beam you up but baby we don’t know Scotty

He my worker, I run it or something, ugh
Payday I’m writing his check, ugh
Disrespect Wap, then he can get left, ay

Smoking dope like a zombie, the windows getting cloudy
Monty said he want the lambo and ZooWap want the ‘rari
P-Dice in the phantom with bitches going gnarly
Walk in with the damn bands and get the party started
Fetty Wap rocking champions, my shoes is Michael Jordan
RGF on my camp end ‘cause now, they got me balling
Keep the rock on my damn hand and I ain’t talking Spalding
Disrespecting my damn camp, I’ll personally off them
I just went to the damn land to show them how I’m flossing

Ay, and if you know me and my niggas then you know damn right I got ‘em
G herbal came from the bottom, shooting and trapping and robbing
Now I got commas, catch me and my killers mobbing
Drinking Rosay out the bottles, Louis, no Prada
I get so fly like a rocket, spent 20k on my Robins
Boy, what’s the problem? I get so high that’s my problem
Deuces and fours in my Fanta ride, with them choppers
FN thirty poppers, AR-15 go grraa grraa
I can’t wait ‘til I beat my case, I’mma leave the U.S and go stay on the island
At the end of the day, know you blessed
Can attest, you sweared I be stressing not smiling
You fuck niggas bad for my health
So I stay to myself with that Wesson beside me
Dedicating this year to my family, fuck all the haters I left them behind me
I the city, know my niggas grimey, stay in the hood, just pull up you will find me
Leave ‘em all in a mess, with your traffic, we sliding
Lurking and ducking no action
Living life and I know I can’t die with this Dos on it’s one of the reasons I’m cashing
And another ‘cause I’m from the streets and young niggas like Fetty and me never had it

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas cause I got 'em
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
And if you ain't beefin' 'bout no money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas, ZooWap got 'em
[Verse 3: Albee Al]
I’m in the gang that hold ten shooters
Pray nobody in the team Judas (please)
No we ain’t scared the whole team do this
Loading choppers and loading Rugers
Bang, bang, bang nigga, touch mine and I start wildin’
Shots fired they start dyin’
Bad dreams and my heart pounding
You pussy niggas stay fuckin around
Be bodied I’m still wild
Ask me how I feel about them
I tell you “ain’t nothing real about them”
They pussy nigga, stay around if I see a bitch
Fish Bow you see me bitch
Just came home and you see me lit
Die for every nigga you see me wit’
See I been in all kind of beef
Fucking up my mama's sleep
Easy on them it’s time to eat
I am who you tryna be

[Hook: Fetty Wap]
My niggas stack their money just to spend it
Cause when you die you cannot take it with you
If you ain't beefin' 'bout the money, then what's the problem?
Don't worry about my niggas cause I got 'em

Fuck these fuck boys man

Black 650 on the road, start to gunning
Niggas make a diss song but want no problems
Black four fifth with the grip, who shot him?
Big ZooWap from the trap, what’s mobbing?
Gold chains on me, couple bands is the rocking
Make me feel fly so all I buy is Rob-
Got ten thousand dollars worth of J’s in my closet
For my girl, drop nine hundred dollars on the wallet though
P’s got six thousand dollars worth of Robins
Seventeen for my beamer, drop thirty on the jeep
Five bands for a Louis eye patch, omg
Not the Gucci one ‘cause you know a nigga stay flee
Fetty Wap from the bando, understand though
How the fuck you the man though? Go where you can’t go
What the fuck is your plan though? Ain’t got no bands though
And the niggas that I rock with keep hella ammo
Niggas tryna diss Fetty Wap, how you do that?
Like I ain’t helping niggas pop, nigga you mad
Put my city on the whole map, you ain’t do that
Talking ‘bout me, niggas get shot, why you do that?
Cause that boy running out the mouth, take a cool bath
Do his ass like the old school in a new class
Just bought a G37 and it’s too fast
Riding through this fuck boy’s hood, let the tool blast
Hop in my whip with his bitch on my cool ass
Just like his bitch, he a bitch, get his crew dragged
Bitch, we the squad of the year screaming ZooGang
Dice pull up on him, then, he kick just like Liu Kang
Montana hit him with the three, call him Lu Deng

1738, Zoovier, Ay
I just wanna say what’s on my mind man

[Verse 1]
We designer down, rocking Fendi
Big chargers with the hemi
We pull up on ya’ll, nigga gimme
I make them honchos hit a semi
I’m talking mula, we got plenty
I fuck her best friend if she pretty
You know it’s ZooGang niggas with me
I let off two bangs to his kidney
Should take his baby momma out to Philly
Send the kids on trip to Walt Disney
I’ve yet to see a nigga ball with me
Monty and Dice standing tall with me
I collect the bands, then, hit the mall with ‘em
Wanna act up? Then, we all get ‘em
Wanna shoot? One shot, we all hit ‘em
Two doors, no top, it’s all missing
Niggas know how I rock, I’m all in
23 on my J, I’m Jordan
Niggas know how I rock, I’m all in
23 on my J, I’m Jordan
Heard these niggas hate me because that I’m a specialist
Diamonds know they on freeze, that’s how you know I’m flexing man
Remixing the whole thing, that’s how you get your paper up
First, you wasn’t on me but, now she wanna hang with us
Rolling off the molly, now she wanna skate with us
Before you try the ZooGang, suggest you try some angel dust
Monty shoot from long range, that’s how he let the hammer bust
AR15 but ya’ll bound to understand though
Shooting big guns, it cannot fit out the window
How the fuck you judge a nigga? Don’t know what he been through
Niggas don’t know me, might’ve seen me when I bend through
22 Forgiato sitting on the fen coupe
Zoovier, you won’t catch me without Monty
Last year, I told him this year was our time, then
I did what I said, now we all shining
Jumpmans for the kicks blue and our diamonds
Robins, go away Trues and I ain't lying
Two bands, one outfit, come on try me
I ain’t even touch the advance, I been bent up
Juggin and finessing at niggas, ain't getting jammed up
Robin wings on my Robin jeans hold my bands up
22nd, I’m a hooligan, I need a phantom
Bitches love me ‘cause I’m getting rich, I ain’t handsome
Get my niggas rich, talking foreigns and mansions, Squad!8Embed"

Either you with us or against us that's just the way it is
I'm sick of niggas talkin' all crazy like I ain't with the shits
I just bought my 10th Mercedes I love the AMGs
And I dropped 1.2 for the crib where I lay at
'Member had to sleep in the house where the J's at
Been gettin' bitches and this money, we ain't play that
You can ask any damn bitch where I stayed at
Shoutout to my hood, 1200 Harlem World, ayy
22nd block, ayy
Servin' party packs, ayy

And you can't change what's understood, ayy
And if it's all good then it's all good, I'ma rep my hood, ayy
Real niggas they know what I mean, ayy

A couple million for my children, gotta get the cream
I turned a thousand to a million, started with a dream, hey

[Verse 2]
And most these niggas say I sing too much and
I don't really show up my bling too much and
I don't really show off my cars too much and
I don't really be with the stars that much and
I don't like to kick it with such and such and
These niggas like bitches, they talk too much
They tryna be just like you, they stalk too much
And bitch you can swerve with the Zoo on the weekend
Fifth of Patron and we gone and we freakin'
Bitch super wet, make her squirt when I'm deep in
Makin' her moan and my name what she screamin'
Wap with the bands, Poppa Smurf start to tweakin'
Jump in my six so fast, tires screechin'
Everything blessed, I could ball for no reason
Hop on the jet, start to glide through the season
In it for a while but they do not believe 'em why

J'suis tellement partout, je porte mes baloches
Que quand je m'éloigne, tu crois qu'je m'approche

I'm like, yeah, she's fine
Wonder when she'll be mine

To see that ass one more time

All fast money, no slow bucks
No one can control us
Ay, yeaaah baby

Just let me roll somethin' up and get high with me baby
Ayy, you're a star, you're so fly to me baby
And to keep it real, your body drivin' me crazy
Ayy, and I'm just tryna make you proud of me baby
She could tell it by the look in my eyes
All a nigga ever do is get high
Countin' money with my niggas, stay fly
Run the game, my niggas bang, that's no lie

[Verse 1: Fetty Wap]
And you know how the set roll
Landin' where the jet go
She can't ever let go
Cause I give her bank rolls
Cross him, break his ankles
What the fuck he think?
I pull up like what it ain't though
Tell me what it is
Niggas talkin' 'bout where I can't go
Tell me where it is
Got the drop on where he stay though
I know where he lives
Niggas thinkin' I'm a game though
So quick to let it rip
Talkin' way before the fame
Need a gun, I'm on they head
Niggas actin' like some babies
Swear them boys my kids
'Member days was in the trap house
Runnin' through them bricks
Never have to see 'em drizzy
Was taught to water whip
Never have to see 'em drizzy
Was taught to water whip

I know you can see the look in my eye
I been gettin' high but somebody took my light
I been on some other shit
Tell them come and wipe me down
'Member all them old bitches hatin'
Bet they like me now, right
Just walked in like I hopped up out the arena
Fist full of money like power to the people
Shot gun, shawty, feel the power of that reefer
Girl I'm hosting for the night
It's an hour 'til we leaving, said
Keep it rollin' up, pourin' up
You say you need a shot, baby girl load it up
I swear the way we goin' up, they know this us
I know that all you lookin' for, baby, is for the love

Two Bentley trucks, one white, one black
Like Kevin Liles, it's a lean

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
Alexander McQueen, Canada goose, Amiri the jeans (Amiri jeans)
Cut the traction off on the track hawk
We 'bout to fuck up the streets (Skrrt)
Two Bentley trucks, one white, one black
Like Kevin Liles, it's a lean (300)
You probably don't wanna beef
'Cause we ain't got guns, we got machines (Ah)
I might pull up in that Cullinan
As soon as I fuck a bitch, her and her friends discussing it
I'm in the trenches, thuggin' it
Nigga, touch me and we sluggin' it (Bah, bah)
In this bitch with Fetty, bitches know I got that fetti
Walk in LIV, they shoot confetti
Took off the diamonds, had to baguette it, ah

[Verse 2: Fetty Wap]
From a hood where you live or you die, nigga
Nigga be living a lie, nigga
Money, I get it a lot
I been counting this shit for a while, nigga
Been throwing up M's on mob, nigga
On gang I been outside, nigga (Gang)
Call, then I'm gon' slide, ayy
I been draped in gold, ooh-woah, ayy
Run up, let it blow, ooh-woah, ayy
Mobbin' with my bros, ooh-woah, ayy
Came up kicking doors, ooh-woah, yeah, baby
[Verse 3: Tee Grizzley]
(Gimme dat, gimme dat)
My new chain 3D
Diamonds HD, ridin' with the XD (Ice)
Usually don't bae but can you get your bitch back please? (Come get her)
She been asking me for money, almost got her feelings hurt
Bitch, why you think my feelings weren't? (What?)
Soon as I fuck, skrr skrr, ayy
I'm at Delilah's, came in the Spider (Skrrt)
Just weighing my options
Damn near hit everything in the road (That's facts)
But I'ma be quiet
With they BM, they be lyin'
With the police they be honest
I'm so loyal I bet on the Lions
Dem' killers do what I say like Simon, bow

[Verse 4: Fetty Wap]
Really came up in the trap
No cap, serving pack, uh (What you need?)
Nigga, you should understand
We don't condone it, we don't do rats
They ain't for cooking the white
Lil' bit of soda, making it stretch
My partner got jail for fentanyl, can't even say it all
Bitch, I said it all
Pull up my car, I'm swerving, doing them dirty
Nigga, on purpose, serve 'em, skrr
Bitch cooking on the stove, ooh-woah
We got problems, let me know, ooh-woah
Brodie quick to let it blow, ooh-woah (Bow, bow, bow)
Bitch with me, my gun is in her purse, ooh-woah
This summer coming 2020 vert, ooh-woah
Took a nigga bitch and made her squirt, ooh-woah
I'm with Grizzley, please don't end up on a shirt, ooh-woah
[Verse 5: Tee Grizzley]
We not the heroes, bitch, we the villains
This ain't a movie, the good ones ain't winning
Why is you gassing him up to beef with me
When he die, you gon' be in your feelings
We don't need an oven, let the K cook 'em (Grra)
Paint shit like a artist, no A Boogie (Artist)
She gon' suck dick for a Bape hoodie
If she ain't going, I'm gone, I don't take pussy (Fuck on)
I roll with killers and robbers (Yeah)
Come take niggas' shit like pirates (Gimme dat)
You heard 'bout a body and you got scared
We heard about bodies and we got inspired (Facts)
Bro off meds, can't give it a rest
He solid, I ain't gotta give him a test
Even though he ain't got no hope (No hope)
He hope your head can fit in that vest, bitch
If the police ask, don't let 'em know (Don't let 'em know shit, nigga)
Shooters with me, quick to let it blow (Brr, bow, bow)
You keep cuffing that bitch, boy, let her go (Let go of that bitch, boy)
Come through with that work and let it snow (Come get these bricks)Embed"
