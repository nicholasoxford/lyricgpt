Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop

Y'all don't live with that nigga
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since fuckin' I don't know when
Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there
If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Chief Keef

If you want some beef boy, I won't be your farmer
I might be your father, ball like Penny Hardaway
Judge trying to lock me up, cause my pee look darker
But that ain't gon' solve none, weed solve my problem
Guns for my armor, nigga fuck security
Out the cut like barbers, got niggas Forrest Gumping
Smoking on this Compton, but bitch I'm in Chiraq
Where you disrespect me at, bitch that's where you die at
All these fucking lab rats, now I got my mouse trap
Niggas wanna fake kick, wanna know where my house at
That life I ain't bout that, I'm 'bout  pushing scalps back

I'm high off this Chief Keef, got me feeling like Superman
That bitch called Chief Keef G, bitch I'm not no MuBu man
All these damn frenemies, I'ma call up PooPoo man
I got niggas in these streets, they fuck around and do you, man

We are Glory Boyz, you know what I'm sayin'
But GLO GANG is just a, just a short abbreviation for Glory Boyz
You know what I'm sayin', just G-L-O-G-A-N-G, you know
We be on a lotta gang shit, we got everybody sayin' ""gang"" now
No squad, you know. We changed that, we changed to gang
It ain't none of that squad. I mean you know we got Savage Squad
You know that's my cousin, Fredo and nem. But um shit
We go by gang and none of that squad

When Wop come around we rockin' with the squad

I don't remember her name but when I fucked that bitch should've called her cutie, yeah that's it

She like Sosa what kind of house you finna get? The one that's got ten jacuzzis, yeah that's it
I got 30 shots in this Glock but I'ma give you a two piece, and that's it
She know I got plenty thots but she say she don't want to lose me, and that's it
I gave the bitch two or three pumps and that's it
She high off two or three blunts and that's it
My guap, she can't get none of that shit
Take twenty out the bank and I'm spending that shit
I'm allergic to three things, and that's it
Fake niggas, peanut butter and lobster, that's it
I only bought a PT, and that's it
Bought a sprite and a 4, hand-dropped in that bitch
I live it, that's why I be talking that shit
Walk in the mall and be copping that shit
Remember when my grandma used to say ""that's it""
Now I ain't gotta hear none of that shit
Bitch said she only want a thousand, that's it
What you smoking on? I need a blunt of that shit
Bitch gon' get put out and that's it
'Cause a door to the face gotta come with that shit
I fucked about two or three thots today, and that's it
I fucked one without a condom I'ma pay, for that shit
I had a threesome with a million different hoes, that's it
The ones hoes admire niggas want, that's it
I got 3-0 in this 4-0, that's it
Let a hundred niggas try me and I'm dumping that shit

I got some Cubans that'll do it all the time
Used to move dope, got some niggas that do it all the time
I used to rob, I got some niggas that will do it all the time
And on Chiraq, bitch I was shootin' all the time
I'm from O'Block, where they be shootin' all the time
But we ain't worried because we got all the guns

Pour that codeine up, it's 'bout that get drunk time
You gon catch your deer, I'ma go and hunt mine

I was thinkin' 'bout you been dead gone
Got a call from my boys like, ""Your cousin is dead""
I was like, ""He couldn't had his head on""
I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything
Give me the chance then I'll head home
I pull up, get that check, when I leave best believe
On the freeway I'm headin' home
I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi
Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties
We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis
Now only thing that I care about is breathing
Why I go hard, Blood be the reason
Wouldn't want me to quit even if I was bleedin'
Gotta take charge, every four seasons
Every month, every day and every weekend

All we knew was Glocks

You got your first deal, you was geekin'
Remember when I got my first deal, I hit you on the phone
Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus
You was like, ""Nah you're Almighty""

Shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40
Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning

Smoking on this earth, this gas and shit, it be filling me up
You think it's your time, but it could be up
That's why I got a thirty on me, nigga try me, it could be up
Tell Tadoe slow ass pour a four of the lean
I love the guap like I love Kay Kay, it's like my daughter to me
Shit, my bank account looks like Norbit to me
Say you gettin' guap, nigga, show it to me, or try me

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Like Tony Montana, who I trust? Me
But it's still more Sosa and less Tony
I know niggas plottin', I know they want me, but this hammer on me
I got some niggas in the cut ready to blam you, homie
And they don't give a fuck about your family, homie
Bitch, I'm glo'd all up, put the cameras on me
Bitch, I'm Almighty Sosa, no Capone, no Meech
I glo niggas up, get them guns and they gon' be blowing for me
I was trying to disguise, how'd you know it was me?
You got a pistol, nigga, blow it at me, you know I'm flexing

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
I walk in the trap, I'm checking the bag, I'm shaking the D
I'm selling the half, I'm selling them fast, they sell it for me
You run in my trap looking for stash, I'm shooting for free
Aim at your chest or shoot at your head, you fall to your knees
Niggas be like, ""For a verse from Tadoe, gon' cost me a Jeep""
House look like the mall, took my bitch there and I bought her some D
These niggas, they watching, these bitches, they watching, eyes all on me
Pop out the cut and light his ass up, hope he don't fall on me
Pick my lil' guys up, take their ass shopping and it's all on me
Just came back from another show, all the god damn hundreds on me
Got a club in the back, tell your friends, ""Come through"", bitch, party on me
I tell that bitch to ride it fast like a Ducati on me

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I got a bitch, she is from Italia

I sell, I ship, I bag, I seal

Big knots in my Balmains, it is
The thing under this Louie, it kills

I bag, I seal, I swag (that Gucci)
The Louie, for real, big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (that's up under)
This Louie, it kills, bang

[Verse 1]
So high up off this dope, I need a parachute
I'm in this Bentley coupe, it's filled with residue
I got my dawgs with me and now I let them loose
Tell the cops lies, 'cause I can't tell the truth
I'm rocking Louie sandals, my son got on Louie pampers
So many Gucci sandals, my house smell like Gucci candles
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me

I got a half a pound, it's rolled up in a joint
You can't hate me now, I'm in foreign cars
She used to hate me now, now she wanna fuck
It's only one way from down, bitch I'm going up
I got the dope and it's in my Louie backpack
In a sportscar, racing to the racks
Keep on hating on me, you not doing that bad
I'm in this M truck, the plates say fast

On me like a hypebeast, on me like a Nike
She know that I was a dope boy, so white, like rice B
He knows his bitch like me, that's why he don't like me
Say she want to ""Eat me"", told her, "" Just don't bite me""
He don't know I got a Glock, say he gon' on sight me
Went outside it's biting, I don't care I'm Icy
Police said on dispatch; is that him? It might be
Kick his ass like Bruce Lee, kick him in some Spike Lees
Ridin' round with my Bloods, but we ain't from Rice Street
And the broom go like sweep, thinking back I might weep
He say he don't like me but looking up my ""type beats""

You ain't never jump out the water, you use to swimming

Pull up on ya block, what's in my gun make ya run
This balling shit be fun, but shooting pistols funner
I get the money later, I got shooting pistols hunger
And when I'm done sparking, roll up and I forgot

Like I'm in New York pull up on you, give my block
You can't serve here no more, hit the bricks, kick rocks
[Chorus]
I roll up flexin', rest in peace niggas
Every day is Halloween, trick or treat niggas
I got the loud pack for the sleep niggas
Roll up, get throwed, Bun B niggas
These niggas tryna see how I don't see niggas
'Cause when I look in the mirror I see me, nigga
Like the aliens, you better come in peace, nigga
Or I'm letting animals out Jumanji, nigga

[Verse 2]
I got the hood bitch I'm no fuckin' board game
I'm Yahtzee with the dice, how I up and roll them
Sosa let me hold some, boy your holdin'
Hold on sit tight, I gotta let my hoe in
Walk up in the party, see my shit swollen
I'm talking bout my pockets, this shit ain't folding
This niggas to dim, these niggas ain't GLOin'
Throwin' money in the club, bitch, rain coated
She say she like her strawberry chocolate coated
I'm ridin' past the border eating guacamole
Alfredo, nigga fuck your mostaccioli
He throwing signs up, like Chief So you gots to notice
I'm Stevie Wonder to the bullshit, with some keys
Since I'm running for the mayor, bitch I get the keys
To the city, bitch I'm pullin' up, with the Ps
Big joints size my feet, smoking Christmas trees (Bang, bang, bang, bang)
[Chorus]
I roll up flexin', rest in peace niggas
Every day is Halloween, trick or treat niggas

Roll up, get throwed, Bun B niggas
