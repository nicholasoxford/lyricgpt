[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I am smokin' on that gas, life should be on Cinemax
Movie, bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
Who he’s? Not I, I smoke strong; that Popeye
Louie V’s in my archives, black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down, on the block with a block out
Hit your ass with that bla-kow, dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
A skeleton in my closet, it's probably one of these dead-ass rappers
It's probably one of these pussy-ass niggas, don't try me, I'll pull that trigger
Got your car note in my cup, and your rent in my Swisher
That pussy so good I miss ya, head game's so vicious
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures

[Hook: Drake]
Yeah, I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya

She came through, she brought food, she got fucked, she knew whassup
She think I’m the realest out and I say, ""Damn, that makes two of us""
Aww, that look like what’s her name, chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy, I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like so one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm, go ask them who just killed the shit
Stay keepin' my cup full so I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back, we don’t talk shit, we just state facts
Yes, Lord

Nigga watch the assist
I run the trap like the marathon
You niggas softer than silicone
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone
I know what it's like when the ceilin' gone
I had a sit down with Farrakhan
Turn the White House to the Terrordome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch!
[Hook]
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Watch out, lil bitch
Uh, watch out, lil bitch
You getting mad
I'm getting rich
You getting mad
And I'm getting rich
Watch out, lil bitch

I had to pick up some litter
I want it easy, please do not tease me
I wore my Yeezys to dinner
This is the season, I got the seasonin'
Don't make me sprinkle you niggas
I got my reasons, you wanna please me
Send me the pussy, not pictures
Met her this week and fucked her this evenin'
She turn a freak on the liquor
Yeah, I am a boss on these bitches
Yeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches
Yeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches
Yeah, rock double-cross on these bitches, yeah
Dearly departed, gather today
On some Prince shit
You know what they say
Me and my safe, got a friendship
Ten on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin' paid
Gettin' laid
Bitch made, took off sick days
6 trey, 6-4 bounce, bitch, bounce
Hood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House
Patty melt with the hash browns
Tryna avoid all the pat-downs
Tryna avoid all the lame hoes
Weirdos in the background
Blackout when I back out
Blow the horn for a pedestrian
Shawty ride like an equestrian
I bought the dress that she in
Red bottoms in his and hers
Got a Rollie in his and hers
Got a car in his and hers
Walk in the zoo and say, ""Pick a fur""
Last night was a blur to me
This mornin' I got two with me
I don't know what to do with me
Goin' ape like the zoo with me
Got a tool with the screw missin'
Two girls in the pool kissin'
Everywhere I go, the rod with me
'Cause these niggas actin' too fishy

Fuck y'all niggas on, man?

Look, I got a big amount
I think I'm the biggest out
Got hits and I ain't even put 'em out
Lit and you can't even put it out
Got the Billboard melodies
Rap is somethin' I do on the side
Crossed over to the other side
And I didn't even have to die
Got the money and I never show it
Let a nigga try to play heroic
Michael Jackson talkin' to me in my dreams
And he say, ""You bad and you know it""
Better shamone with my check then
I'm a J. Prince investment
Niggas love to talk reckless
Then see me like best friends
Got the sand-colored FN
And I've never seen the inside of a Marriott or a Westin
Five stars, nothin' less than
Fuck niggas on your payroll
And you let 'em know the safe code
And you knew him for a month though
But you call them niggas big bro
You could move in the Hidden Hills
And we still don't live by the same code
I'm respected everywhere I go

Skip the rainbow, funny style shit
And it's straight to the pot of gold

I'm Rambo with this ammunition, my camo come from Tru Religion
Them broke hoes can't pay attention

Mr. Telephone man, there's something wrong with my line
When I call my baby's number, I get a click every time
Every line is dope, you can snort it
Working in the pot, I can make it do aerobics
I'm haterphobic, they mad cause I'm winning
They busy high and catching, mad cause I'm pinching
All my bitches different, all my diamonds glistening

Fifty black trucks gonna follow when I pull up

Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talking on the FLX phone
Poof, just like that the whole check gone
Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun gang, all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in her tummy
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy Trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that

So I'm in a room full of Pocahontases
And this shit is off the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, laying with my seat back
We next, we ain’t never left, hollerin' we back
All this ice on me and my niggas playing freeze tag
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him
I come through with the yopper on
Turn that nigga into hot bologna

Then wear it all to church, nigga, halleluj'

Thank God for the first nigga to start trapping

I got a problem, with these bitches
Trigger finger, keep itchin'
Well I'll pull it, I'll do it, yeah

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz & All]
Yeah! Hang up on a bitch, call it crucified
Time to go to work, no suit and tie
Bumpin' Makaveli, I be trappin' out the telly
My nigga did a dime and he back already
Got that sack already, man we got them racks already
As far as your girl, I hit it from the back already
I tried to get a tan, but I'm black already
Your pockets on a diet, my pockets fat already
Three niggas with me, me myself and I
God don't like ugly, you should testify
My T-shirt come from Bergdorf
I make so much on a verse I take the third off
Bird call, swerve off
Bust a nut on her, tell her that's a load off
Shorty ass soft, like a Nerf ball
If you don't like what I'm doing, nigga, fuck y'all

Drank in my cup holder, hope this shit don't spill
Pull up in the new edition and that's word to Johnny Gill
How I come up with this shit and all these verses that I kill?
I have no imagination, everything I do for real
Bitch I'm camouflaged, down put your camera phone down
If she got a ass and the girl a fan, it's going down
I'ma fuck you like I've been waiting a century for it
Give the pussy up and I'll trade you the memory for it
In the bedroom forever, that's what her roommate will tell you
Man I just hear this shit and think about what Tunechi will tell you
He might call up Patricia, she 'bout to call up Melissa
Tell 'em come to the cribbo and do them both, double dribble
I'm colder than a hospital, she love the dick that I give her
Hit her from the front, back, side, twist her like cigarillos
I put the gun to the pillow, I don't want blood on my clothes
Gotta keep that Trukfit fresh, shoutout to all of my hoes
(Tunechi) That's just how my OG would sum it up
I been working all winter just to fuck the summer up

And she know I'm a pothead, that pussy like a pothole
I’m colder than a snotnose, man all these hoes is my hoes
And if she bougie, fuck her once then leave her hanging, dry clothes
I just built a cemetery, niggas dying to get in
Niggas lying, they pretend, don’t cross that line, it's paper thin
High as a star, make a wish, I’m a shark, I ate the fish
I got no heart, I hate that bitch
You hate that bitch? Well I hate that bitch
Will jump a nigga like a chessboard
Do a drive by while you riding on your skateboard, uh
They ain't even know it
Have Drake sing a song just to get her pussy wet
Then I take her to the crib, man, fuck that bitch right on the step
Put it in and take it back out, then I back out
Hair-Hair Weave Killer known to snatch the fucking track out
Put me in the ga-game coach, I'm the antidote
Pull up, kick, throw and take the money, and the dope
True, 2 Chainz, I'm on a plane, and a boat
I am so cold, I need a cover, and a coat
Kick it at the mall, call it football

Mama, MAMA!
(Wha, What!)
You get that money out my pants last night?
(Boy! Naw I ain't get no money out yo pants! And quit yellin' at me!!)
Ain't nobody hollin' at you!
I had a dream that rap wouldn't work
I woke up on the block, had to hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr, skrrr: hit it with the fork
Rap don't work, records ain't bein' sold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold
So much money on me, it won't even fold

[Verse 1]
I got Medusa on my sneakers
My dick up like ""nice to meet ya""
100K for a feature, hundred K's at my leisure
Then we aim at your people
I be higher than a eagle
When I'm sipping on that codeine
Free my nigga Sigel
Ridin' on a jet, headin' to that Costa
Soon as I land I be in that Testarossa
If I die tonight, you gon' see some flexin' ghostas
I'm the man in my city, same thing in South Dakota
Man I'm running up that check, show you how I do it
I drink red bitches, I don't drink Red Bulls
Man they tried to give me wings, but I already had some
I'm all that and then some, my trap house is my income
And it's booming

Woke up on the block, hit it with the fork

I'm ballin' like Mr. Clean
I gotta keep my kitchen clean
God bless me like I'm finna sneeze
Doctor weigh me on a triple beam
D-boy in parenthesis
All gold in my amenities

My trigger finger's like a lemon squeeze (Baow!)
Climax! Make your main ho my side-chick
I'm so high, your whore get hijacked
And my vision is Pyrex
I do it big like a 5X
Killed they ass with the eyepatch
I got bad bitches on my side
I done fucked around and got sidetracked
My first night, I spent five stacks
Next night I forgot to count
I'm so hot; who gon' put the fire out?
I'm the fireman, I put fire out
Got a pole in my basement
Tipped your girl like Maliah now
Ridin' on these motherfucka's until they blow my tires out, uh
[Bridge]
My wrist deserve a shout-out, I'm like ""What up, wrist?""
My stove deserve a shout-out, I'm like ""What up, stove?""

.454, I pull up on niggas, I tell 'em lets get it
Niggas they talkin' on Twitter, you niggas you know you gon get it
Benjamin Franklin, niggas know that I keep it 100
Got me a new clip for my .223 and that bitch hold a hundred
I'm still in the hood, I got me a check and I don't want no Nike's
Bitches, they suckin', and fuckin', they do everything except bite it
I can go slow like an old man, I can go fast like I got nitrous
Spent 20 racks for my brother's appeal and I ain't talkin' no Vicodin
Over 1 mil in this room, bitch, I kinda sound like a Pisces
Lil bitch you know I'm the bomb and 2 Chainz the light, no lightnin'
Wow, these bitches excited, me and Thugger, we 'bout to start up a riot
I ain't got no pussy all week, I'm on that ""bitch, suck my dick"" diet

[Hook: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
Monica, come home to me, yea come home to me my dear
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser

Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser
Make a little money, leave a little on the dresser

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz + Young Thug]
Ain't nothin' special man, I sold it all yester'
Pull in Phipps Plaza in a motherfuckin' Tesla
Ain't no pressure when you got a little extra
Put them beams on your face, have 'em lookin' like freckles
Dammit man, I do not know Tar but I'm  having Xan's
My bitch pussy wet like it's wetting rain
This bitch clap on me while I clap at mans, woah
Got Balenciaga's I ain't even wore yet
Half a pound of gas I ain't smoke yet
Traphouse filled up with Ziploc
Use to get my living room suite from Big Lots
In a strip club with some flip-flops
Thought it's the time, baby it's not
Got a lotta windows on my crib, nigga
Bout to put that motherfucker in a tint shop
[Hook: Young Thug + 2 Chainz]

Who killed little boy, who killed little boy?
Rat infested hallways, no escape, no escape
From misery, no way out from that hell

[Verse: 2 Chainz]
I'm bout to give these niggas what they ask for
I used to have to argue with my land lord
Yea, my nickname is Tity Boi
Bitch gotta have at least a handful
All my cribs came with a damn pool
Used to stash work in my camel
Young 6'5"" with the handle
If you don't watch Atlanta then you need to turn the channel
See I pull up in this bitch in a Phantom
Front grill looking like it's dancin' (it is)
Put some stacks on your head little boy (lil boy)
Yeah they 'bout to call you the grandson (lil boy)
Pussy nigga gonna need a tampon (lil boy)
Put rifle bullets in a handgun (lil boy)
Keep a bankroll on me, nigga
By the time I eat some bacon I got bands on
All my cars I done put rims on 'em
I done touched down, no end zone
All that bitch do is run her mouth, nigga
On the right but that bitch got a Sprint phone (hello?)
Man she got about 100 acres
Enough yard for me to put a couple Benz's on
And I just pop me a perc
I might fuck that bitch with my Timbs on

3 Chainz, oww

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Caught up in my bullshit, put your head on backwards
And skate off after, engage in laughter 'bout what just happened
Fingers in napkins get sent to mammies, is that too graphic?
Catch you in traffic, you sitting Daffy like stealing candy
My ceiling’s absent, my wheels are massive, my friends assassins
All of us bastards, our mothers queens and our women dancers
My rivers rapid, my fins are splashin’, my gills are flappin’
I bit some matches then sipped some gas and went kiss a dragon

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
I’m really rappin’, no finger snappin’, I’m pistol packin’
Y’all niggas slippin’, my swag is drippin’, so here’s a napkin
What’s really happnin’? Verbal attackin’, I’m showing passion
Know what I mean, see I’m the king like I’m from Akron
I’m going overboard, somebody call the captain
And when it come to getting checks, I always want the fat ones
I’m so high I can sing to a chandelier
My flow a glass of Ace of Spade and yours a can of beer

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Too many bitches, too many blunts, too many buttons
Not enough bullets, them niggas buggin’, the SWAT is comin’
AK on shoulder, no shoulder shruggin', aim at ya nugget
My weed sticky like acupuncture and magnets, honey
Knock on the side door three times and have your money
Or get to steppin' like Kappas stompin', I'll slap a junkie
I’m having lunch with Italian Sonny, don’t ask the subject
Lord, why you took Rabbit from me? He say, ""Don't ask me nothing""
Too many bodies, too many bangers, too many bundles
Not enough bullets, these niggas buggin', I heard they stung you
It’s gon' be trouble, we come through and catch you while you cuddle
Them shotgun barrels like tunnels nigga, don't even mumble
[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
I’m back to ballin', I'm in the back full of magnums only
Pull on the scene and I fuck your queen playing Pastor Troy
Our weed ready, turkey spaghetti and caster oil
That's codeine, turn your guillotine to a fashion show
In four minutes I'll turn this into forensics
In a foreign car with a foreign broad that’s long winded
Paper long and you taking long, you just don't get it
Hung the phone up on Satan, told me he want a song with me
Hotter than Mississippi in summer of 1950s
In a van full of some niggas and white bitches
Get pulled over for swervin’ like, ""Hi, officer""
When he ask me why I was swerving, ""I’m high, officer""

Got a mansion, a condo, a cabin, I sleep in my Phantom
So high dancing with the stars to the Star Spangled Banner
I change your channel, I change your pattern, I ring your Saturn
I bang your madam, she get on top and I shake the ladder
I make her straddle then gather and calculate the data
I listen up for the snakes or the baby rattle
I play the shadows, don’t play no games, I straight get at ‘em
I’m on the chronic all day like it’s my favorite album
[Verse 6: 2 Chainz]
A plate of salmon, the Cayman Islands, a stripper dancer
If I don’t get the car first, I’ll have a temper tantrum
I’m innovative, I demonstrated, this nickle plated
I don’t care if you owe me a nick, nigga you need to pay me
I kiss ya lady, eat her pussy then kiss the baby
Get situated, get keys off table then leave her 80
I really made it, get it maid, Schwarzenegger
Won’t wrestle niggas, I spatula all you action figures

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
I’m so high the blunt feel like a dumbbell
These niggas tiny like a spider on a Spud Webb
I got some upscale cocaine on my thumbnail
I feed it to my fun girls, they say fuck yeah

[Verse 8: 2 Chainz]
I’m doing this shit like whatever
When I go I’mma leave for the better
I told her you dig like a shovel
I want a Ferrari in yellow
Just so I can match all my yellow bitches
I been a playa since elementary
I got more bars than a penitentiary
I got a clip that hang several inches

This a Philippe not a Breitling
Fuck her to sleep, she had pipe dreams
Yeah, this is the king of the trap
Yeah, I pull it straight out the hat
Yeah, everyone better take cover
Yeah, got rappers under attack
Uh, my daughters inherit arrogance
And they intelligent, that's a fact
Bought me a car February 1st
You already know it was black on black
I cover my scars with the tats on tats
You better back back, rat-tat-tat-tat-tat
I pass you a joint, better pass it back
I went to Montgomery, with packs on back
Sent her to the store for some plastic bags
Sent her to the store for some rubber bands
I started pitching so easy
I throw the work to you underhand
Underworld, underground, underline
I'm underdog and you under mine
This here ain't no once upon a time
This really happened for real
Can't even trust our own government
Aw man fuck all that humble shit

Man, y'all not in this bitch, y'all are not familiar
Y’all are immigrants, the law not in this bitch, I
Fuck the opp, no competitor
Got into it with my bitch last night
She was right, but I had to get at her
Two popped bands and they dance on my waist
Hit the face, that’s the editor
I don't take pics on a jet, lil nigga
This shit regular, G5s all in my backyard
Sit you roody-poos in the nosebleed
Now my pockets holding big protein
Big, big protein (Protein)
I leveled up past Fab Five
Your favorite rapper Desperate Housewives
Playin’ with me get you chastised
Milk 'em all 'til I'm satisfied
They didn’t fall for it, strategize
Switch the flow 'cause they know niggas like identity theft
Oh, you got like me? (Say less)
Oh, you pop like me? (Say less)
Mask keep a nigga (In check)
Huh, swag keep a nigga (With checks)
Huh, tags on my wall (Success)
Huh, played the underdog, now flex (Now flex)

Buy a crib fill the rooms up with all stoves
Wish I could tell you what she doing to me
Pocket full of money that's bluer than the sea
I feel like I just paid off the plug
Drop the top off the whip, hair-line receding
High last night so I woke up this evening
Can't pimp me so don't you tip me
Rims on the car make it six feet
So I can park the car wherever the blimps be
I want a bird for my birthday, I drink syrup with no pancakes
Yeah, bitches round my pool, I make them hoe look like my landscape

Look at the pussy and play kiss and tell
Fix her hair then fix her nails
Even pay a few bills
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal
And my whole crew ill

Going so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda
Staying focused, this yola here
Black and white ice: polar bear

Yeah, yeah...
I'm gettin' to the monies, with an apostrophe
Fucked her on a pile of clothes, now she a closet freak
Yeah, I bear arms, I got something up my sleeve
And when she wit' me, she don't wanna leave
She just wanna freak, she don't wanna sleep
Put it in her mouth, now she don't wanna speak
Yeah, I'm at the club, I got strippers at my table
I call doin' a 69 a favor for a favor
From the cradle to the grave
Shoot a nigga from his ankle to his waist
You can tell that I'm paid cause I'm high-class
Fucked a bitch in her eyelashes
We in a jet, who gon' fly past us?
Tint all in my eyeglasses, I don't see ya, hater
And I don't get dropped, bitch, I drop the label

I don't fuck around with you jokers (ooh)
Ain't heard a word from my old friends
Heard they wanna kick my doors in
I done loaded up the 2-2-3
I'm so high they might call a goaltend, yeah
Lord knows, stashed work in the console
So many autos in my garage, I can't open my car door
Bond on me like the sun on me
Gettin' this bread she say, ""You dropped crumbs on me""

And it turned into gymnastics

What is it?
Freebase
What's free about it? (Honorable C.N.O.T.E.)
I thought if I said, ""Listen, should I talk about freebase and what is it?"" or somethin'?
And people said, ""Well, no, because then people will start doin' it""
No, let me— I gotta talk about what happened to me

[Bridge]
See, where we're from, it's all or nothing
And we take penitentiary chances like it's nothing
We came from nothing
Freebase on top of the oven
Get money my type of discussion
Y'all can do this shit for free, a nigga like me gon' be hustlin'
Freebase, freebase, freebase, freebase
Freebase, freebase, freebase, freebase (2 Chainz)
Freebase

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I came from nothing
Me and my niggas, we came from nothing, sold that 'caine like it's nothing
Told you from the introduction, I came from the pain and suffering
Two pit bulls and a TEC-9, TEC-9 use to jam up on me all the time
Swear to god, if you come up in my mama yard, I'ma shoot that motherfucker 'til it get tired
Big dually truck got six tires, big ties when I rhyme mixtapes
And I keep shitting on the competition, I'm about to put out me a shit tape
Guess we ain't playin' by no rules, every night I freestyle on Pro Tools
Tell Flex come to the A, we'll carjack him by one of them regular-ass old schools
I don't respect my elders, these right here Maison Margiela
I cannot get no earrings, it'll make my Rolex jealous
I've been a felon since fifteen, my Expedition had a big screen
Half you niggas was constipated, half you niggas wasn't shit then
Zone one all the way to zone six, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own shit
Fuck y'all, I'll buy my own whip, fuck y'all, I'll buy my own brick
Tell them pussy niggas that ain't pay shit, ""Better be ready to let the gat loose""
I done did a song with everybody from Jermaine Dupri down to Papoose
[Chorus]
I came from nothing (Skrrt, skrrt)
I came from nothing (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)
I came from nothing, I came from nothing (Skrrt, skrrt)
I came from nothing, I came from nothing (Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt)

[Verse 2]
Work hard, play hard, work hard again
My bankroll had twins, can you comprehend?
Seafood lover, I don't eat pork
Used to hit them J's like a three-point, my partner mascot is a pitchfork
And you already know what this for, me too, rent due
Doggin' these hoes like a shih tzu, so cold, I recorded in an igloo
Nigga asked me why I don't drink, man, let me tell you what the wine do
My partner came in and said, ""This my girl,"" I had to tell that motherfucker, ""Mine too""
Court dates in the summertime, might pull up in a 'vert
No matter what the charges is, I'ma pull off with a smirk
This right here for Old Nat, this right here for Godby Road
This right here for Riverdale, trappin' at the Stop-N-Go
Trappin' at the Texaco, it was Amaco before it was BP
My plug from Mexico, he fell out when he seen me on TV
Sold drugs to my loved ones and it's hard for me to admit it
The first time I've seen a crack pipe was in my parents' kitchen

Was gon’ sell a few bags to Lil Fee
Couple years removed from HBs
Tatted lyrics from Jigga to Jay-Z
I went to Eastover before Katrina
Remember going to Magic riding in my Bimmer
And this was way before FEMA, and you was rappin’ and singin’
And I was slanging the Ps and smoking nigga like Newport
Comin up off of Too Short, my underwear was my hoop shorts
And then I went on tour and recorded songs on your tour bus
And that was ’08

Ridin’ off in the Phantom and Mr. G he was driving

I told you that I was rappin’, told you I wasn’t writing
You said Luda was foolish because he wasn’t excited
That was way before Tyga, I saw Nicki with Gucci
You said, ""You can make a million rappin' 'bout some pussy

I get blow like dandelions, fuck more hoes than advertised
They say, ""Tune, you’re dead wrong,"" I say wrong had to die
Pussy nigga don’t keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed, but the high stay the same
Prices go up, but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
Chillin’ in the crib with the lock on the door
Layin’ on the couch with the Glock on the floor
Within arm reach, security, alarm breach
I just cut off the lights, hope I don’t shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp
I smoke so much hemp
The world too small, it feel like four walls
You see, I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin
But I still took ‘em, and nigga, we made it
T, roll that killer, weed up in the swisher
And make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin
They cry for help, we get ‘em a hankie
Ain’t nothing sweet but the shit that we drinkin’
The bitches we bangin’, the cinnamon danish
The penalty's pending, shit is restraining
It is a shame, but niggas is shameless
Niggas is assholes
Or enemas, finna get anal
Injury, time out, I just blew my mind out
But still I’m maintaining
Real gangsta shit, it get dangerous
You talking money and guns, two languages
I throw niggas from off of the plane I’m in
""Oh, my God, it’s rainin' men""
Said the weatherman to the anchorman
I send hella cash to the bank I’m with
What you do it for if it ain’t for this?
I watch my step so much, I’m starting to feel like my ankles’ wrist
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
And rude awakenings get taken in like fragrances

I steal her, like Jerome Bettis
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus
He ain’t never fly, nigga, like an ostrich
They say ain’t nothing for free, but please free my partners
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yeah, lobster rolls for an appetizer
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer
I’m in my Rolls Royce because it’s black and wiser
And don’t get in the way, my nig, this rapid fire
Brrr, stick ‘em, I’m a victim of being a victim
Codeines, Xanax, and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean Molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with two sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I don’t never call and you miss her
I got every gun except a missile
I paid attention to the minister
My silhouette is sinister
Only child with trust issues
You couldn’t walk a mile in my hoop shoes
Me and Tune, two loose screws
Two parts in my box cut, my pop wouldn’t even pop up
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo T and ice watch, moccasins without socks
And I smell like money, I can count a hundred thousand with the lights off
Woo! Yeah
[Outro: Lil Wayne & 2 Chainz]
I say, bitch, I smell like money, that’s that dopeman cologne (yeah)
And if he ain’t getting money, don’t love him, leave his broke ass alone (yeah)

On the road of riches, it was some bitches takin' pictures

Y'all niggas lame for that, y'all niggas lame for that
Shoot a man in his back, should be ashamed of that
Young niggas banging back, young nigga banging back
Then we gon' fade to black then we gon' fade to black

[Verse 1]
I left the crib walking, drove a Mercedes back
You wasn't blessed with ambition so who you gon blame for that
Tried to get off the Act, still didn't know how to act
Still pull up in the back, sit my ass right in the back
Tell my driver when he open my door to take off his hat
Double saran everything so that you know its a wrap
Double salute anybody that made it out the trap
Some of y'all probably still owe me from back
In the back in the back in the back in the back
I had that work right in front of me fuck all you niggas you wannabes
Most of you niggas is under mes, I'ma give ya ass some to see
My car don't have car keys, my crib got palm trees
Pussy smell like sardine you, need to get up of my lawn please
This a real nigga conversation, real nigga demonstration real niggas
No Cristal or Hilfigers, a bunch of ignorant lil' niggas
A bunch of red young tenders, dark skin queens, Puerto Rican princess's
Scratch my hand my palms itching, hit the dope start twitching
This a new kinda kitchen, marble countertops, see through fridge
3 thousand for the microwave, touchscreen stove lil biiiiitch!!
Please don't make me relapse, make me start back trappin
Everybody in the city, saying that boy Tity done started back snapping

I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah

I hit the trap today, I'm gon' hit the club tonight, yeah
Treat every night like it's Saturday night, like it's Saturday night, yeah

[Verse 2]
I sat in the trap no one cooked at night, I treat my third strike like its Kryptonite
I stopped serving sacks over qualified, have you ever seen a homicide?
Have you ever seen ya partna die? Have you ever been traumatized
Even at graduation i had a bookbag full of yams, tryna multiply
Enough of the negative actions, I got my paycheck off passion
I'm wearing 4 bracelets for fashion, don't think its a race when I pass you
Stop talking that mafia shit, you never met Meech, J-bo or Illz
Luda charged me just to dip, was there when Chaka was swung on by Tip
I'm like oh shit we goon tear up this bitch, pull out a stick when u put up your fist
I'm like these niggas done fucked up my fit, funny how heaven and hell co exist
Funny how life can put you in the mix, I sold the pounds and go hustle the bricks
I booked studio with the trap money, Lil Wayne used to come get the bags from me
You still asking niggas for gas money, I look at these rappers like crash dummies
I look at these bitches that fuck with these rappers like bitch you just fucked with my last homie
Kesha can come get the last from me, Heaven can come get the last from me
Harmony can come get the last from me, Halo can come get the last from me MAMA!

Bitch, you could get on this shovel

I just got me a bezel
My slippers is clean
All I wear Tru Religion
I paid a grip for them jeans
I got a lust for the cream
I need a money machine
I need a money machine

I see you doing your thing, but it ain't nothing to me
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see

[Verse 1]
I say I'm incredible, most legible
Schedule ain't, but I can make your girl flexible, edible
Put her top and call it putting her on my pedestal
You would never know, unless you worked at the bank
Camel toe, look like steak
And your boy look like great
2 gun bang
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane
You can tell your girl here, because a cab came
And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change
Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune
Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune
And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction

Yo it's my time to shine, so I'm checking my Rollie
A bet with the Lakers, I bought a necklace off Kobe
I be fucking your girl, I was texting her only
I told her, ""I'd like your legs better if they was open""
Ever since the beginning, niggas knew I was focused
Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers
I'm a fucking example of a fucking example
Hit her from the back, nigga, that's a fucking example
I came up on Luke Campbell, I'm so sick I need Campbells
If you know I'm showing up, I hope you come with your camera
Got the city on swole with my Louis bandana
My car is shitting on niggas, I should ride with a Pamper

[Verse 3]
I give you something to see when you are looking this way
If you approaching with the drama, then we approach with the K
And when you look in my eyes all you see is the pain
On medication, I can drink 200 a day
When you hot in the A, you get a spot in the A
It's so big that shit look like a spot in the A
These niggas jogging in place and they standing in line
Till somebody rhyme bout beating me, then they start dancing in line
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30
With my ice on early, in all gold knight sterling
Try to cook a brick off a George Foreman
Take a girl, it'll start spoiling
Living room floor look like a nigga going bowling

Got a lake in my yard filled with dope, nigga!

Motherfuck the other side, (motherfuck the other side)

Everything official, my pistol's dismissin' missiles
As far as running game, my nigga, I need a whistle
My nigga, I need your sister, oops, I don't think that came out
Still fuck a girl with my chain out
Still do my thing with my thing out
Long ass clip, I could shoot you without aiming
My life, your motherfuckin' entertainment
Dangerous, leave you with the angels
Shoot yo' ass from all types of angles, explain this
Well, it was just bunch of niggas and then just me
They came close and it just skeet
They tried to run and I said ""Come back""
If you think you're alone then there Bobby Womack
Hold that, ridin' that Phantom down Old Nat
Nigga said ""What up, pimp? Where the hoes at?""

Ride around on my side of town
You might fuck around and get peeled
I rock Mookee, rock Y3, got Bathing Apes on my heels
Nigga, this ain't no game, there ain't no competition
I knew he was a fake, got good intuition
23 and I'm still livin'
Been all around the world and it's still Richmond
Cause I'm loyal to my soil, good to my hood like oil
Got me in that water, bet it boil
Bitch, I'm a boy, beat the beat up like Roy
Consider your bitch my employ', real to the core
Straight up, I never been fraud, and I put that on my lord
Y'all rap 'bout clothes that you cannot afford
Where's the Versace and where's the Tom Ford?
Everything we rap 'bout, that shit be ours
This bitch a freak, she should get the award, aye

Last night I fucked a supermodel
Got head on the way home
She left her other friends at the club
Got home, and I fucked her with my J's on

[Chorus]
And that's ratchet, huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying
To walk backwards bruh
(Woah, bring it back)

[Verse 1]
Take your bitch like I'm the dog catcher
Take your ass to the mall after
Spa day, shawty, kill that pussy, pallbearer
You from that RuPaul era, I'm from that hell nah era
Real niggas say tru, real niggas ain't you
I ride around with that yapper on me
Gun-clad with my Glock up on me
Surround your ass with so many shots you'll be claustrophobic
Crib so big a dinosaur can run through that shit
I'm a shark, and you a tuna fish
My paper up, got your girl with her ankles up, gangsta boy

[Bridge]
She got her T-shirt and her panties on
She trying to smell my cologne
I can fuck her anywhere I want
I even fuck her on the floor
[Chorus]
And that's ratchet, huh?
Her ass so big it look like she trying
To walk backwards bruh
(Woah, bring it back)

[Verse 2]
I'm on top like a toupée, you on the side like a toothache
Box your ass, suitcase; I'm real, you ain't
Calamari, crab cakes, my closet the size of your dad's place
You lookin' at a star, I wish that they could add space
I'm getting money, fast pace
My hoes gay and my cash straight
He can't ball, he castrate, she the opposite of last place
Do it, bust it open, slow it down, Robitussin
My girl got a big ass, your girl got back pockets touching

I want it all, I want everything
Balls out, I let 'em hang
Window shopping for a wedding ring
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane

To walk backwards bruh
(Woah, bring it back)

If you pat your weave that's ratchet, my last album was classic
Shawty on my dica, backwards spells acid
She pop a P like a Xanny, she'll use no hands and no panties
She rock like nose candy, you fuck with me, ain't no plan B
I'm a D boy with a degree, I sold dope in my momma's home
My girl pussy deep deep, so right there is my comfort zone
Born alone, die alone, mud in my styrofoam

Who me?
I take this open beat (Yeah)

My nigga said, ""Fool, that's the ocean,"" yeah
I use good pussy like it's lotion, yeah, uh
I shoot a nigga for promotion, yeah
Drop my album off the court and make 'em post it, yeah, uh
I told you trappin' is a sport
My old school is a Panamera Porsche, yeah
My last bitch got some head you can't ignore
I told her I might take her head on tour, uh
I used to roll my weed in front the store
Then drive so fast, I disrespect your car
I told 'em that my drizzle caviar
I'm playin' with the clit like a guitar
I'm playin' with the clit like a guitar
I'm playin' with the clit like a guitar

Let me get this straight, if I drop 40 today
You don't care if I eat, you don't care if I ate
They say, ""You better have a good grade like a mixed baby hair""
They say, ""We goin' to the tournament, we gonna need you there""
I have more crab legs than Jameis
You fake like you got a girlfriend, Manti Te'o
Maurice Clarett with bangers
This could drive a college kid crazy
This that Barnum and Bailey, the greatest show on Earth
I can't wait to go to the league so I can buy my mama what she want
This that mindset, that mentality
Made me a killer, fatality
From the public houses to a couple houses
To a couple cars, sippin' a cup of tea
No teacup, this a bully (Bully)
I re'd up with a fully (Bah)
My mood change about money (Uh)
Might open up another company
Put that in an LLC (LC)
Like, ""How you gonna try to sue me?"" (Sue me?)

My jacket pants filled with few G's (Who we?)
I surround myself with a few G's (Few G's)
Wait a minute, let me follow this
You think because I got a scholarship

[Outro]
I think that we have brainwashed our kids in the Black community
To think they can only be entertainers, uh, and jocks
I said, first of all, we can be doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, fire and policeman

Then you do bein' in the NBA3Embed"

And when you spiral through the atmosphere
All they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy
Humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
And there's no one to talk you down and tuck you in the bed
Lord, it's so ironic that it's funny
Or something for the books or the bars
To bob your head and nod, I recall
So many never ever thought you'd make it
So sad they were mistaken, the joy they tried to take it
Mama said it, ""The best thing you can do and be is you""
""This world ain't got but one, so give credit where it is due""
Ain't that the truth? And here you are, a black unicorn
Mythical, mystical, since the day that you were born
Mastered all the madness, let the magic have his way
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Cause there's a place that you can go, no one else is allowed
Sitting up on your cloud, so high when you look down
Just glance upon the beauty and the wonder to be found
Then know that you can stop your search, cause love is all around

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Free at last, free at last
That's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate
Sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And when it's cold outside, so your pipes won't bust
Turn on your faucet
Drip, fuck the water bill, we stay in apartments
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Yeah, and that's my car talking
Old school running with the dogs barking
Hop out that bitch like I'm sellin' coffins
Weed so strong, I be seldom coughing
And I'm covered in Balmain
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay, life ain't no arcade
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade
[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe
You thought you had the best of me
But now I'm what you need

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Competition best to fear me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe
I leave them pussies stinking, they need Summer's Eve
I practiced repetition, I need 100 G's
100 M's, hug and squeeze, Dad kept this in the dungarees
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
I change hoes like I change gears
And my yard so big I got pet deers
And my homies try to act like I ain't real
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
You need a focus group, my group focused
Hit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus
I'm the dopest, you can quote this
Underscore, it's just me and dope
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen them rich, I done seen them broke
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me
[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Freedom, it's all I really want
It's all I really want to be
It's all I really need
I want, I want and I believe

You have to sit on the floor, oh!

Everybody know I dumps that white girl like Kevin Federline
Don’t pay me no nevermind
These niggas is buggin’, pesticide
I count money in my spare time
Just paid a hundred dollars for a hairline
Label talkin’ bout what they woulda did
Bet they hustle me and you could be a winner
Girl, you eat more pussy than me
Girl, you shoulda been a nigga
Pockets swellin' up like Lymph nodes
Been a go-getter from the get go
Always talkin' bout what you was finna do
Damn broad, thought that you were finna get dough!

Wanna be a man so bad homie
Ain't wanna see me get free

If I would have shook your hand, I would have been your boy
Now you extra hot since I dun' hit your broad
Now you talkin' now, 'bout sparkin' now
You prolly would shoot somethin' if you had some heart
That Bentley come from exotic rentals
Gotta go back Sunday, so you flat broke Monday
Probably could go spend 200 on somethin'
If you was gettin' Boosie money
You in King of Diamonds throwin' counterfeit
You might as well gon' pussy pop on the stage
All these rappers lyin' on records

Dope boy meets Khaled
Don P and eat salad
Walking around, my feet Bally
Sisquo and St. Ives
Six guns, eight knives
Potato on the barrel of it
Make you niggas hate fries
Been poppin' wheelies since 14
Sleeping with them, in them since 14
Ready to take one for the team
Ain't no discount, if ain't the one, we got a miscount
I am the truth, lil' nigga, shooting bullets from the booth, lil' nigga
BOOM

Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
You too concerned with others
This for the single mothers
Might have a millionaire
Moving through Riverdale
Jacket on Rick Flair
Watch on Rick Flair
James Brown with the slick hair
Watch how she dance on it, dance on the work
If the pussy squirt, put her name in a verse
I am so high, I'm scared to jump
Keep the gas on me, I'm prepared to pump, alright

[Chorus]
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes
You can sleep when you die, you can sleep when you die
Look in my eyes, look in my eyes

We make love like chemist when we penetrating
When I first met you girl I was intimidated

And what we have now is more than the average
So before we get married I'mma tell you this

Two chains on and they are anomic
I like red pussy when that body brown
And yeah on that loud not that Bobby Brown
Put her face in the pillow she won't make a sound
Every time I take a shot I'm tryna make it count
And if she get sad I might buy a bag
And if she get mad I might buy a jag
Put a ring around it I can't wait to mink her down
Glad we had a little girl so it can trickle down
Woke up this morning I feel good as fuck
If your girl wit me you know she good as fuck
And I can't even lie that pussy good as fuck
First I pick her up then take her home and pick her up

Beautiful... Pain

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you
Raising a daughter sometimes depending what her father do
Niggas stunt on you, front on you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead
By the time you get that
I be somewhere with a six pack and a six pack
Her lips and her hips thick
My boxers are covered in her lipstick
Her pussy fat but ain't good, so that's a misprint
I'm a misfit, I did it and beyond
Shiny watch look like the old Diddy on my arm
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Run this rap shit, I got stamina
You an amateur, I aim at 'cha, I bang at 'cha, hope a plane hit 'cha
Fuck you and whoever came witcha
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
I got some gambling scriputres like um
[Bridge: 2 Chainz]
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
Got ounces of loud you can hear me smoking
I be coughing on the crowd you can hear me choking nigga

[Hook: Lloyd]
Oh I feel so fly
Came so far, but I still wanna fly
So come on in this car, this yacht, this plane
See what this beautiful pain, provide
Baby look into my eyes

[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Shamon.. hm-mmm
You talk about hurting try washing clothes with no detergent
Daddy deserted so now we syrup sandwich serving
Dreaming we had a furnace so cold sleeping on the curtains
What can I say it got me highly motivated, mama two job working
But now the companies are merging
Need a two week notice before they say don't need your service
I'm too young to have burdens, but still feel I should be further
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
My mama need earnings, ain't had no time I had learning
Call me a hypocrite, backslider, you name it I done heard it
The way they speak of me you think I'm already murdered
It's hard to be laid back, my haters so assertive, but
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
I gave my dice up and I gave my dykes up
I gave my vice up and every club that lights up
And this is were the intern with no perm lights up
[Interlude: Ma$e]
You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you don't gotta say much

[Verse 3: Lloyd]
Life is a game of inches
Every move leads to something better
There is no time to play the benches
Gotta get in the game and live forever, and ever

Let 'em all be forgiven
Let it all be forgiven (When your dream, when your dream, dream, dream)
Just let it all be forgiven

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
When your dreams turn to nightmares
Transactions turn to Nike Airs
Went to Greenbriar Mall and bought five pairs
I stayed in the Creek, junkies used to preach
In the dope game, tryna reach my peak and go undefeated
I pleaded with the judge, this my first offense
High school b-ball, I'm tryna get a scholarship
No ACC, SEC, ClayCo APD
On a bumpy road like an ATV, EBT
Used to give me peace
I smile on the outside, inside discreet
As far as the past, wish I could press delete
Let my dogs off the leash
Rather buy it than lease or get murdered in the streets, fine line
[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius, 2 Chainz, and JAY-Z]

Pray for the children (I pray)
I pray for our healing (I pray)
I know you feel it (I know you feel it)

Got a phone call from Lil' Fate
Somebody shot his son, he didn't make it
My head achin', hands started shakin'
Foul beyond flagrant
He said, ""Bro, what I'm supposed to do?""
I paused, remorseful
We been partners since public school
Kids ain't supposed to die before us
As a parent, it's apparent, ain't no parents
Seeing stops once we leave the carriage
Cold of the streets react with the heat to create balance
One of the biggest revenge is prayer
Me, Shondrae, and 'Cris was there
Guess Flesh won't spend Christmas there
But in spirit, know you hearin' it loud and clear
Whole family miss you as we stare off in the atmosphere
No fear

Your sins let 'em all be forgiven (Lord forgive him)

[Outro: 2 Chainz, Marsha Ambrosius, & Francis Farewell Starlite]
Hey, I don't know need to hear this
Dead lies, that is how we livin'
But if you're doin' somethin' to make...
Just let 'em all be forgiven
If you're doin' somethin' to make your parents have to bury you
You may want to slow down
Everything got a consequence, whether good or bad
Rest in Peace Chalyne
Bigg, I love you, bruh
You know what I'm sayin'?
My other partner lost his son too, right before the 18th birthday
We out here bullshitin', for what?
Pray for my soul
You don't get another life
This ain't no practice life
Pray for my sins
These tears that I'm crying, let them all be forgiven
Let them all be forgiven
That's it, that's it
[Outro]
In all his majesty and might, his brilliance and his beauty
His black and his blue
""Boy,"" still slips from their lips when they address him
Still linger in the velvet of his dreams, the scene unseen
Black boy fightin' for manhood in a world that still sees through Jim Crow lens
Oh, them love him in his place
Separate, away, torn, disconnected, passive, submissive, and shufflin'
Oh, now just turn that shufflin' into dancin'
'Cause you know them love black boys dancin'
And singin' and ballin'
You know them love black boys' strength
But don't love black boys

I'm 'bout to pour out some lean
I got blue cheese in my jeans
I bought my queen Celine
I got my team Supreme
It ain't no in between
You either in or you out, I took a different route
I had to figure it out, I went to picking them out, you, you

That's the issue, just got a rental, just for instrumentals
I'ma keep the bitch 'til December
And park it on Broadway, away from the hallway
Away from the 'partments, away from the arcades
We don't play games with them boys
We bring the pain to them boys
I caught a plane with them boys
I taught the game to them boys
I am ashamed of them boys
Blame it on fame, blame it on whatever you wanna blame
I'm smart and insane, imagine a genius that don't have a brain
That live off of resources, that learned off of geek sources
I do play with 3 persons, I got it from researching
I'm fresher than detergent, I'm fresher than each person

Watch how I resurface, watch how I rework it, gas

40 cally chrome, on deck
Gotta meet with my connect later on down in Malecone

All the Kush gone, gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone
Weed man coming with a half a zip
30 minutes in the trap is a half a brick
Always hustle to get it
I never ask for shit
If it's family or money I might have to flip
I'mma say it if it's on my mind
I like to take it one day at a time

I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one, ooh
Yea, I like to take it one day at a time
I like to take it one

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Never on the guest list
Always unexpected
In so many checks
I should make a checklist
Looking at these emcees' like they should make a deathwish
Got my girl in the kitchen, cooking ambidextrious
Left wrist, right wrist
Whip that, white bitch
This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to write this
Look at my Hublot, watch how the light hit
Look at my new ho, watch how the light hit
I done did it all, except die nigga
Too dehydrated to cry nigga
I was struggling, had a time limit
I wish this Aquafina bottle had wine in it
I wish that pussy had a sign in it
That said,""Warning: If you hit it then you mine nigga""
Damn, that crazy bitch on that crazy shit
If you don't make money it don't make sense

Ill meaning of sickness, I use the pharmacy as a witness
I mean anything around me that's against us, they can't be
I got God on my side, that's all I need to ride
See that's all I need to vibe, asking what I do tonight
That's really none of your business, unless you wanna get in this

I had the Lam Black and green like a Parakeet
No, I ain't tripping, put the pigeons in the Cherokee
Everything a nigga got, I got from slanging birds
What I ain't get from slanging blocks I got from slanging words
Snow

[Hook:]

[Yo Gotti:]
I got a car, that bitch a classic
White on red, inside out that bitch nasty
When I pull up on them sixes, speakers blastin
Black scale white work clear plastic
And everything I got I got from selling birds
Half a brick to do a verse, I guess I am selling words
That dubbed it up
Niggas send me dranks so they double the cup
Got two chains on, bitch I'm icey as fuck
2 brains on my arm that's a 100 and up
We sell dope it ain't nothing to us
New whip, new bitch, nigga change for what?
And where I come from niggas bang for none
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for some
Drinkin soda bakin soda I'm yammin up
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up
My niggas grinding we banding up
These pussies know not to be playing with us
Work
[Birdman:]
My bad bitch, my money long
Car game filthy and my game strong
The kitchen hot
My block rock
My neighborhood shot cus them cars hot
Nigga on some money shit
Got back on that other shit
Came with the fame nigga listen while you learn bitch
Money is for show shit
Gettin it while we blow this bitch
All the time we are gonna show where we are flowing bitch
100 thousand on the watch
Living lavish off top
Neighborhood watch
Cocaine flocks
The coke game strong
Overseas phone
Nigga made it home
So we gettin it on

It's so good just to be alive, well, well, well
It's so good to be here, yes it is
It's so good just to be alive, well, well, well
It's so good to be here

[Verse 1]
Natural disasters, all these emotional rappers
Master of my own fate and I own my own masters
Don't let this smooth taste fool you, when I bust, I school you
They throw rocks and hide behind the computer
It's yellow tape and white chalk when I'm on the beat
Yeah, you rich, but your talk is cheap
Never see me tryna walk a sheep
I'm so famous, can't even cough in peace
Your alter ego is Maltese
I was waitin' for Auntie Punken release
You niggas cryin' over spilled milk
Probably never seen your friend killed
Probably never seen your dad die
Or played dodgeball with fed time
I done some things I ain't proud of
Like sold my mom drugs
The devil put some toxin in me
Demons tryna have an auction in me
They wanna sell my soul
Goin' once, goin' twice, never sold
Best story that was never told
Keep in mind that I have several episodes
A lot of things to be thankful for
A wife and three kids, I may make it four
[Chorus]
Never get the credit I deserve
I don't know if you hearin' every word
I don't get the credit I deserve
Rest in peace Johnny, really had them birds
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
You know I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat

[Verse 2]
They wanna know where the jumpshot come from
Coach Outlaw taught me the BEEF method (Rest in peace)
Balance, eye contact, elbow room, follow through
See, that's what I was taught to do
I probably learned more from Coach Gwynn
Than I did from my own kin
Yeah, the streets was my sensei
I sold dope then rapped about it on my mixtape
I had respect but I gained more
You rather be underrated or unemployed?
Hmm, think on it
Keisha ring big enough to skate on it
My lifestyle big enough to hate on
This beat hard enough to put Jay on
My yard too big to put a rake on it
But I got the Cullinan and the Wraith on it
[Chorus]
Never get the credit I deserve
I don't know if you hearin' every word
I don't get the credit I deserve
Rest in peace Johnny, really had them birds
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
You know I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat
Yeah, I'm a threat, I'm a threat, threat, threat

That good ass weed, too
I feel like good ass weed can solve any problem, for real

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Stayed in the streets like it's room and board, they knew me for it
That’s beside the point like a shooting guard, I'm moving forward
Had aspirations of college ball, I done it all
Back on the wall, I'm so appalled, I’m gonna brawl
My fashion sense commenced when I was young
Wore guns in dungarees next to a pack of gum
Unfit mothers that's on that butter, concrete gutter
Wanna hear that gun talk, that Draco stutter
This the life I chose, and it chose me back
They threw me out to the wolves, the wolves threw me back
Got no compassion for rats
The pastor said, ""Who else gon' bleed for me?""
I told all my side bitches they couldn't cheat on me, uh

I met my BM when I was 9
I had a hunch back then, but I took my time
I told 'em Trump was gon' win, they said, ""You lyin’""
I seen a whole bunch of signs, I didn’t sign
I told you empty your pockets before you took my charger
I told you they wasn't solid before you took them charges
Trademark the three and then market to moms in supermarkets
Taraji P said don’t leave after I won the Best New Artist
I'm like a fortune teller, Orson Weller
More developed Shark Tank idea, I'm an orca whale, an ocean dweller
Freer than an open letter, I connect the polka dots
They just gon' say conspiracy, haters gon’ say it's photoshopped

I'm 'bout to call my lil' homie to go steal me a Tesla
Travis Scott say he love I put my soul in it
And J. Cole told me that I'm the one that cold with it
Ayy, I'm outside with the glizzy, he say that boy silly
Versace on my feet, Versace on her titty
I got two chains on my neck, but I be more litty
Remember Master P told me I was the new Diddy
Master P tried to sign me, but I wasn't goin' for it
I told Birdman, ""You is gon' need some more coins""

Foreign exchange, I walk in the rain
Still won't get wet, nigga flick up the flame
Twist up the game, switch up the chain, play peek-a-boo
I take ya girl and her friend and do a switch-a-roo
Started with a nick and got a 62
It was memorable, my planets were digable
Used to stashing work off in a inner tube
In middle school I worked the trap no interviews
Just told shawty that I'm in to you
I'm the type that make a old school a Bentley coupe
Turn one to ten, that's what I tend to do
It's an amber alert I gotta missing roof
It was black and it was traveling fast
I love you now I don't care about your ratchet past
Designer shoes, matching bags
Let them niggas pop shit baby we popping tags
If I ever fall off I'll be hopping back
Got a bad bitch with me told her hop in back
My car speak she dark meat
I be eating MC's nigga shark teeth
Velourz hoodie, I ask em whats for goody
If you are what you eat but I am not a pussy
You couldn't stop me with a bunch of Uzi's
And all we really do is shoot a bunch of movies

But now when they see me they just think of hope

If I was sellin swag man I woulda sold a ton
Designer sneaks leather seats
They say money talk thats why you never speak
Every verse I do is a rest in peace
Wish this highway to heaven had an extra seat
Rap game, extra sweet
Big ass charm conversation peice

Million off rap but the trap was sweeter
When dealings on the block all prices cheaper
I been doing this since guess and fila
They say my entourage each car four deep eight heaters
Drop the middle man to cut the cost
They say my whole click cut from a different cloth
And of course, we pay the cost, with each block that we off
You take off and call back it ain't our fault that ya lost ya lil bitch
Ask ya boy bout them forty he lost
Talk slick Glock Forty ya boss now you the president

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Choppa kinda old, but a new clip
Shoot your ass, put yo ass on a news clip
Hope her two lips smell like tulips
Put you in the ground right next to the tulips
Nigga talkin' shit on the other side
Tell that pussy nigga I pull up
Used to sell work to his aunt, he ain't push weight
Nigga did pull ups
By the time ya look up, nigga done cook up
When you turn away, a nigga done took her
Got her in the suite, looking like a hooker
Jumpin' on the bed like Jimmy ""Fly"" Snuka
I take her to the mall and I pocketbook her
You tryna' spend time, nigga probably book her
Yeah, I'm tryna' fuck her, fuck her like I used to
I don't believe in karma, but I believe in Kama Sutra
Put one leg on the other leg
Then I skate away like Winnipeg
And I'm through fucking with these lame niggas
You a zero like a Easter egg
Got a lotta shooters in my repertoire
Got a dope spot called Escobar
Member when I used to play basketball
Now I'm out here playing ratchet ball, ooo!
[Hook: Future]
2 dollars a zip for some Actavis
Purple that Sprite in, then you pour it, you know we want it
Mollies and roxies you know we want it
Trap out that house with the doors open
We put that work in on any corner
That moolah, that fetti, you know we want it
I was trappin' out the house with my doors open
Comin' down through the town with my doors open
Got that carbon on my lap with my doors open
When I'm rollin' through the trap with my doors open
When I'm rollin' through the trap with my doors open
Catch me rolling through the trap with my doors open
Wanna pull up at the club with the doors open

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Bowl like a tournament, she hang like a ornament
Nigga, your jewelry look prosthetic
Rims on my car got it bowlegged
Took your bitch back and got store credit
Still drinking Actavis, niggas is slackin'
I rap like the plastic on packages
Everything I do immaculate
House full of marble, no vacuuming
Charges consist of the trafficking
Trappin' I had the bitch bumpin' like Acne
Gettin' some head on the balcony
So far ahead they in back of me
Walked in the store left my doors open
All my Rolls Royce got 4's on 'em
Heard you niggas told like 400
Been the coldest nigga out the whole summer
Uh, talkin' bout bruh let me hold some
Like we used to sleep on the floor or somethin'
Lookin' for a cup so I could pour some
She brought a friend who brought a friend
We gonna have us a foursome
We started up around 4 or somethin'
We did not stop til like 4 or somethin'

As I met 2 Chainz a few minutes ago, as I gazed into his face, I felt that I was in the presence of royalty. There's a certain power presence that he gives off
I tried to be, everything you want and need

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
'Cause you got a deep title don't mean that you deep
Substance shallow on shit creek, I heard Cole speak
About the bricks, Kendrick got Compton lit
And I've been lit ever since I sold nicks
Never fabricated about my fabric, the scale, that's my apparatus
I give a fuck about the sorriest rappers
This actually happened, path in the back pathogenic
Moved that blow out like we were afrocentric
I had a front row entry, I had the codeine kidney
I made up the Bentiaga truck, you owe me a Bentley
This the rap Ken Griffey, got at least 10 with me
Got at least 10 on me, I'm anti-phony
My girl anti-bony and she get that money
I bought all this shit, don't go acting anti on me
It's Mr. Epps in the bank, I give a F what you think
I bought a Tesla today, there's nothing left in your tank
I did everything except a fucking song with Jay
But I murdered every song I fucking did with Ye
See my verses are better and my subject is realer
See my mom was an addict and my dad was the dealer
And their son is that nigga, I'm no Black activist
I'm a Black millionaire, give you my Black ass to kiss
We used the tree for a fence, I used to land in the trench
Used to dust myself off, then I eat me some shrimp
Coulda did anything, I coulda been me a pimp
I coulda went to the league, I took it straight to the rim
I took it straight to the block, I got Xans in my sock
I got plans for the pot, I got bands, you do not, huh

I'm more Gucci than Vans, give you a Gucci advance
This the chance of your life, you ain't prepared for your life
See the man without a mic is just a mic gimmick
Anyone, Jordan, Jackson, Tyson, Bivens
Phone number unlisted
Gave her the digits to a number that is long distance
She on the wrong mission and got my palm itching
I had it on me, you can see it in my prom pictures, ugh

I never trust my neighbors, so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard

I never trust my neighbors so we got burglar bars
You know the times is rough you know the times is hard
