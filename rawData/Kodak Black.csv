Glee
(Southside)
Ayy, lil' Metro on that beat

[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 1]
I jumped up out the Wraith, Kodak bought a Wraith
I get any girl I want, any girl I want
She want me to save the day, but I ain't got a cape
She wanna see me every day, she wanna be my bae
That money make me cum, it make me fornicate, uh
I'm the shit, I need some toilet pap-er
Follow my player rules, then we gon' be okay
On the real I need a bih' who gon' cooperate
[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
They sendin' all my homies on a mission
And I ain't tryna miss out on these millions

[Verse 2]
I told you niggas I'm gon' be that fuckin' nigga
Everything be good 'til you doin' better than 'em
They wanna see a nigga shot or see me in the system
All you niggas out here poison like snake venom
Codeine in my liver, rockin' Balenciaga denim
I'm booted even when I'm sober, I don't need a jigga
They sendin' all my niggas on a fuckin' journey
I told that baby to come over 'cause I'm fuckin' horny
My mama told me, ""Kill these niggas, son, keep it goin'!""
I'm thug to the bone, but I'm still her baby boy
Lil' Kodak, boy, they hate to see you in a foreign
They miss when you was in that 'Yota kickin' doors
[Chorus]
Lil' Kodak, they don't like to see you winnin'
They wanna see you in the penitentiary
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen
Girl, I don't wanna be the one you iggin'
My mama told me, ""Boy, make good decisions""
Right now I gotta keep a tunnel vision
I need me a lil' baby who gon' listen

They wanna see you in the penitentiary

Young nigga, I got old cash, spazzin' on they ass
I got Prada on my ho ass, got my last one mad
Pop a nigga like a damn tag, shoppin' on they ass
I just bought a new old Jag, yeah, it's so fast
Smokin' flocka, you a jackass, all I smoke is gas
Don't you ask me where the pole at, where yo' clothes at?
I ain't talkin' 'bout my niggas, dammit, but y'all trippin', too
Is it you? Damn, my nigga, what the hell got into you?
Project Baby, y'all was skippin' in the hallway, I was skippin' school
On my Ps and Qs, on them jiggas, call me jiggaboo
Bleedin' concrete, bet you niggas won't come 'cross the street
Pardon me, I don't talk to you so don't you talk to me
I ain't dissin' on nobody, B, I'm vibin' on the beat
Honestly, I'm just tryna be, I just gotta be
Tryin' to get over on anything, they tellin' lies to me
I spent five on my pinky ring, she love my diamond ring
Anyway, I'm married to the game, she said her vows to me
I ain't gettin' on my knees, bae, you bow down to me
You go down for me, you lay down and do the time for me
Sorry, boo, yeah, I lied to you, but don't you lie to me
It's Lil Kodak, the finesse kid, boy, who hot as me?
Told the doctor I'm a healthy kid, I smoke broccoli
I will run around your whole board like Monopoly
Ol' boy, you's a broke boy, flocka's got you beat
Chocolate, call me Reese's, can't catch me without the piece
C'est la vie, I'm ten toes down, you fallin' off your feet
I will trick yo ass for a treat, call it Halloween
Yeah, that money's what I play fo', call it lottery
Goddamn, you's a clown to me, you's a clown to me
You can't smoke no Black & Milds with me, get in the car with me
You a funny guy, don't you even joke around with me
How could it be? Get from 'round a G, you grounded from me
I'm a freeband junkie, you a junkie
You gettin' skinny, I'm gettin' chunky, gettin' money
Want some food? Boy, you hungry, I want them hundreds

In a Hellcat 'cause I'm a hell-raiser

I got the fire on me in BET Awards
When your well run dry, you know you need me for it
When I pull up in the Buick, you know what I'm doin'
If the police get behind me, I'm fleein' and eludin'
Sleepin' on the palette turned me to a savage
I'm a project baby, now I stay in Calabasas
Like I still serve fiends, like I'm still jackin'
I be sippin' on lean, tryna keep balance
Hit that Z-Walk, Dickie's with my Reeboks
I don't say much, I just let the heat talk
Your jewelry water whip, diamonds like re-rock
My lil' baby ride the dick like a seesaw
When I stepped up on the scene, I was on a bean
When I jumped up out the Beam', I was in Celine

Look, every time you see me I'm surrounded by them snipers
You ain't never run off with a hustler in your life, huh?
I'm from 1800, I'm a hot boy, but I'm iced up
Ugly corner where we smile with you and we don't like you
Just hopped off the plane, I just got out about a day ago
Everybody love me, when they see me they be like, ""There he go!""
Got me a new lady, we 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Crackas took my .40 so I'm 'bout to go buy a Draco

Money fallin' out my ass, I got a lot of cash
Ayy, everybody runnin', nigga got a gun
I ain't makin' beats but the Draco got a drum
I don't wear no fuckin' Yeezys, I got too much sauce
Like I don't believe in Jesus, how I triple cross
I ain't even brush my teeth, but I'm on the block
I ain't even brush my teeth, all I do is floss

And I'm codeine dreaming
(And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming
And I'm codeine dreaming, and I'm codeine dreaming)

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling
I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky
I'm moonwalking but my Christian Louboutin's bleeding
I'm smoking moonrocks, shawty, and I feel the ceiling

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
I'm in Uranus right now, I think I seen a demon
I thought I left you back there in the cell or am I dreamin'?
Say I ain't dealing witcha, dawg, I'm going a different way
I broke up with my redbone, I went the milky way
I'm ridin' in a Wraith, feeling like I'm outer space
Stars on my sunroof, Planet of the Apes
I couldn't wait until they released me, right back on the turf
I took off on you bustas, left you right on planet Earth
I feel like Jimmy Neutron, how I blast off on a verse
I know my son gon' like this song so I ain't finna curse
Know he gon' wanna explore the world so I'm gon' show him first
Say we just distinguished  beings, baby, me and you diverse

'Bout to take off on you peons and go back to Mars

Tried to moonwalk on the moon and had to wax the floors
Tried to put me in a box and then I crashed the Porsche, err!
'Bout to wake up in your biatch and go back and forth, yeah
Got her trapping out the the Fiat, she be back and forth, yeah
'Bout to put myself together, take it back apart, yeah
Got the codeine on my breath, it smell like caviar, yeah
Codeine dreams and they come true too
That's my spaceship, brp-brp!

FaceTime Kodak with my new new, I left you 'cause he knew you

'Bout to go to Saturn, heard they got the baddest species
You can hit me on my Galaxy, you tryna reach me
I went to Mars to get some Xanax bars to go to sleep
I'm in my Orange space shuttle flyin' two seats
I left Future in Pluto 'cause that boy was too geeked
End up playing Sudoku all the way in Mercury
I took too much of shrooms feel like I'm on Neptune
I'm with an alien, she show me what that neck do
And I'm a metamorphosis, you just a regular dude
You need a space suit to get up on this latitude
If she ain't foreign, then she boring, I need a Zorcon
You takin' morphine, homie, you a moron

It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy

I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank

I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes

No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice

I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'

I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific (Glee, glee)

So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now

I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB

But lowkey they be easin' me

How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame

New AP, flood
Water on my butt like a tub
I got my lil' gun in the club
Don't worry about me, I'm a thug
You kill a street nigga, get a dime
If you kill a rap nigga, get a dub
Big chain on my neck, don't budge
Fuckin' DeJ Loaf like a stud
I swapped out the mic for the gun
I swapped out the ice for the mud
I swapped out the spice for the bud
Fuckin' on a dyke, I'm in love
I'm fuckin' with a dyke, she the one
Kodak don't show no remorse
I be automatic, tryna get a nigga touched
Kodak on tour, with his boys
Say they got a whole gun store on the bus
Missy Elliott, come and sex me
Hoppin' off a jet, to a cheque, to a jet-ski
I beatbox a nigga like the music
I'm thuggin' in my Reebok, I never need Gucci
I don't even see the confusion
I'm fuckin' Young M.A., long as she got a coochie
Say she got the strap and the toolie
Say she put the crack in her booty
[Chorus]
I be pullin' out straps on these fuck niggas
I go Young M.A. on these dumb bitches
Like a dyke man, you niggas can't fuck with me
If a nigga says it's up, then it's stuck with me
What's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me
Ayy, what's the principle? Pimpin' ain't easy
I'm invincible, niggas can't beat me8Embed"

Could you send me a flick? I'ma send you a dick pic when I'm horny
If I kiss you on yo' lips, would you tell your sisters in the mornin'?
Would you keep it a secret? Like, I ain't felt this way before
Wanna tell you that I like you, but I don't, 'cause I'm not sure
I just take her heart and score, then I love her 'til she sore
I just break her heart in fours, then I don't want her anymore
If I eat it, could I treat it? Could I beat it with my sword?
She want love and I want war

You could leave, but where you goin'?
If I hit that thing the right way can I take you to my prom?
Wanna strap you 'round to my waist and come take you to my mom
Do you get that picture? You could be lil' Kodak
You don't get the picture, girl, I'm lil' Kodak
You could be my Cheri, you could be my baby
If you lookin' for me, I be right on 18

Yeah, dat way
I'm 'bout to grab the Wraith, I'm 'bout to grab the key
I'm 'bout to snatch your baby girl and skeet all on her face
I got a feelin' that today gon' be a fantastic day
I'm gettin' tired of the Rollie, I think I want Patek Philippe
It's either I win or you lose, 'cause I won't accept defeat
And everybody wanna have the sauce, well I got the recipe
I'm sippin' on Belaire 'cause it make me feel like I'm on ecstasy
I love my baby, when I come home, I be rubbin' on her feet
And she be always in my chair, she hate when I be in the streets
My rims taller than my son, I'm 'bout to drop another one
You think a nigga in a band the way I hit him with that drum, ayy

All this money like a nigga hit the fuckin' Power Ball
Sippin' on champagne, my whip on Dana Dane's
No time for you lames, I'm flyer than a plane
I'm ridin' like a train, she love to give me brain
You shootin' with your eyes closed, you ain't Sniper Gang
She held me down when I was gone, I bought her Audemars Piguet
I love her like I love my brother, so I let her be my connect
I put her thick ass in the vet, ten bracelets on her neck
You know lil' Kodak love to flex, I got my momma out the 'jects

I'm God-sent, I know I’m God-sent
I swear 'fore God
You know what I'm talkin’ 'bout?
Now, I done overcame so much obstacles
Came up from up under so much rocks and shit
Even though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen
I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God

[Verse 1]
I'm God-sent, like He sent me up so I can relay these messages
Like He use me as his vessel, like He use me as an instrument
Tryna locked me in a box, they hate how God just keep on blessin' me
They locked me in a box, I pray to God this ain't my destiny
I don't drink no lean, I’m sippin’ on holy water like this my medicine
I'm a livin’ testimony, every album like a testament
Everything I went through made me who I am 'cause he be testin' me
So I'm breakin’ bread with all my fam 'cause I don't take no ecstasy
I done sacrificed my niggas 'cause none of my niggas see the best in me
They want me slingin' metal like the Devil, but I'm Heaven-sent
My brother, my mother them addicts fuck my daddy 'cause he neglected me
I'm 20 years old, but I act like I been here before, like I'm a veteran
He speak this shit through me like I'm a prophet, but I'm a reverend
Put my blood, sweat and tears in all these lyrics 'cause this my Exodus
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
[Chorus]
Ayy, blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby

[Verse 2]
I just shot a nigga, now I can't sleep
My brother, he just washed me down with bleach, oh
Project baby, snotty nose, head peezy
Now everybody 'round the world tryna be me
Miss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV
I'm on Instagram showin' off my VV's
You won't understand that this wasn't easy
I been walkin' 'round with my head peezy
Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
Mama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry
I'm in middle school; sellin' weed in the hallway
I was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'
Jackboy, that's my G, we like Batman and Robin
God, I know you lookin' out for me through the darkness

Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated

Ayy, I'm just going through one of my old pads and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
You know, a nigga so versatile I don't even need no auto-tune and none of that shit
I could sweep the flow up, the melody
Like I could speak to all her fans through every genre
I fuck wit this beat, tough though, ya heard
Helluva made this beat, baby
Everything on my path for this
I swear to God, dawg, I never imagined this
I remember I was out there on my savage shit, carjacking shit
On my snappin' shit, trappin' shit, ratchet shit

[Verse 1]
Seem like I lost more than I ever gained
Ain't get nun out these streets but pain
Ain't get nun out these streets but hard times
'Cause in these streets ain't nun but hard times
Tell C.B. I say wassup
Tell everybody I say what's happening
Tell E-Pimp I said shoot me som'in
Tell them boys I said stop flaggin'
Tell my momma that I'm comin' home
Tell the world that it won't be long
Ask my hoes wassup with they phones
Tell 'em I'm away but I ain't gone
I said boo bear what you wanna do
Once you slide, imma follow through
The stand took a nigga up and through it
Lil Dash told me, Kodak don't do it
Tell my son that I love his ass
Tell 'em I can't wait to hug his ass
This for the niggas who got all that time
Now they trying to give them numbers back
A nigga shot my cousin four times
I heard through the wall my brother doubled back
I just bumped into this super jit
I'm hollering at Lil Fam through the vent
I'm letting you know I do this shit for fun
Tell me go then consider it done
Shoutout Petho and my brother blood
My nigga C-Lo he just caught a thug
I'm shooting cee-lo in a nigga ass
They hit a nigga for his whole bag
Tell them boys I said stop crabbing
Send it even if I never asked
I knew I should've told my lil nigga DJ to chill
But I can't tell him shit he doin the same shit that I will
I'm thinking bout how would it be if we ain't get on them pills, if we ain't never chose the streets and picked up the steel
I'm thinkin' bout how would it be if we stayed on the field
Like I ain't even have to rap, 'cause I got other skills
At nights we ran down with them sticks and got them automobiles
And we was jackin' cars and shit 'cause it wasn't hard to steal
Like doin bids and seeing it come, but this the life I live
But I know that this my last one, something gotta give
Seem like God, got me paying for all the shit I did
'Cause I slowed down a while ago, switched up positive
The rough was just enough for a nigga fell in love with the thrill
But before he forgive me I gotta pay for it still
And I done did so much of shit that I ain't proud I did
But when I took rappin' serious I threw the towel in
But Lord you say you gon' forgive me, so forgive me then
'Cause I done picked the Bible up and read Corinthians
I'm still young and I got a lot to experience
I guess the first time in my life I felt this serious
I gotta lil boy now and I wanna be there for bruh
The feeling he give a nigga I ain't never felt this way before
And you can look into my heart and see that I'm forreal
That I done resulted in a metamorphosis
God, you know my destiny 'cause you gave me this gift
You the one who put this breath in me to make me spit these lyrics
You done gave a nigga a chance to pay my momma bills
You done turned me to a man unlike my daddy is
[Interlude]
No this ain't over, I got some more to spit
That was for the real niggas
I got some shit for the hoes

[Verse 2]
She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
She nothing like you, she different
She nothing like you, she magnificent
She intelligent, she love me better than you
Better than, she love me better than you
She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
Could you hold the title, it come with a life
Could you hold the title, you don't have to lie
Could you hold the title, could you play the role
You can't hold the title, baby let me know
Could you hold the title, could you play the part
Could you hold the title, till death do us part
Could you hold the title, hold a nigga down
Could you hold the title, tryna figure out
Take you out to dinner, stick this dick in your liver
I'm fuckin' your head up I'm playing these mind games witcha
I'ma suck that pussy good, then you ain't gon' hear from a nigga
I'm fuckin your head up with all these extracurriculars
I can fuck Virgin Mary, 'cause the game so unordinary
Had plans on gettin' married til they had me on solitary
You left me here stranded, I'm feelin' abandoned
You got me so hurt right now I need me a bandage
Transgression
Show you your corner, who gone stay solid and be down for you
When you really want 'em, when you really need 'em
When them people playing with your freedom
When a nigga shit on me one time but I be tryna get even
I'm tryna get equal
I'm iced out riding with that heater
I'm in that Thunderbird, I'm sliding with that Desert Eagle
Tell me who my people, show me where my folks at
Who gon' ride for Kodak?
Who gon' up and shake on me?
Who gon' jump the gate on me
Pillow case that thang on it
In case he tryna lay on me
Changed my address
But karma she know where I stayed on it
But that bitch better come correct she know that I stay on it
I ain't sleeping so forget about coming creepin' late on me
Got the 12 gauge on me
I got the 38 on me
I got the MAC-10, I used to have the baby 'K on me
I bought a Xbox but I don't play on it
PS4 but I don't play no games on it
The beat over got so much to say on it
My heart cold put a glacier on my wrist
[Interlude]
I'm forever abnormal
I know I wrote this shit longer than a average rapper
Ya'know I'm sayin glee
But you got me fucked up
I be damn if you don't let me keep ridin' this shit boy

[Verse 3]
I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I be damn if I don't find a way to make some cash
I be damn if she come over and she don't get mad
Be damned, I be damn if she think she gon' get a bag
I be damn if you get me and I don't get you back
187 you screw me and you get nailed
I wrote this in the cell, free my niggas who ain't tell
I be damn, I be damn if I  go out without the heat
I be damn if I take that nat nat out to eat
Boy you ain't livin' like that you know you ain't in the streets
Even my ho can get whacked, I be strapped when I be sleep
I be damn if you niggas come run up on me
I just called my woo man, told him pray over me
I be damn I be damn if I don't come home in a week
I be damn I be damn thinkin' a young nigga sweet
I be damn if she don't call me soon the molly kick in
I be damn if she don't tell she gon wanna turn up again
Yo bih gave me a key, put me on her lease
I'm standin' at the feast til they bring in me a beast
It's too much weight on my shoulder so don't tell me hold up
Feel my heart gettin' colder turning to a polar
Reppin' Broward County Florida, I'm from out the nolia

Off top, chargin' extra for a rock
Finessin' all I know, that's how I grew up on my block
How you think I filled my shoebox up with knots?
Was thuggin' on the block, I ain't wanna punch a clock
I was gettin' bands while ya mans was gettin' hot
Sold my .22, he the reason I bought the Glock
Pop, one false move ya get shot
Catch me slippin', going with a smile like I'm Pac
Just want a bone, I'm a dog, nah I'm a beast
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you tear up the sheets
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you come back for more
I'ma come back 'til you suck me 'til ya throat sore
Aye, aye, aye ho nigga
Might just make you my bae
Just playin' hoe, come let me nut in yo' face
Nigga play with me I'ma knock off his face
Call Draco and Tae, they gon' let that bih spray
Gang, snipe 'em, bang bang
No drive-by, this personal, hit you close range
If we really beefin' why you put it on the 'Gram
If we really beefin' why you ain't thinkin' 'bout ya man, or ya fam
Can't catch you, they gettin' blammed
Easy to touch you, I don't gotta use my hands
Easy to touch you nigga when you got them bands
Nigga be hatin', lowkey he just a fan
On my block with the Glock, run down on a opp
Was a jit when they tried me, try me now they gettin' shot
Anybody try me now, on God they gettin' popped
Fuck nigga run up, swear yo' life gettin' robbed
Make a pussy nigga wish he went and got a job
Hit his ass with that rara, I'm a shotta
Free smoke, no ganja, Mad Max ya
Re-rock ya for actin', deserve a Oscar, boy ya fake
Real fragile, they be quick to break
Turnin' state, they jump on ya case, trap you in the gates
I know niggas doing time who ain't got release dates
Spendin' most of their time plottin' on a great escape
Niggas hate, guess all the loyalty been misplaced
This not a race but I chase the cake like I can't wait
No more dirt where I lay, so I stay outta state
I ain't tryna rack out so I stay out the way
From the draco to the .40 put respect on it
Aimin' at his head, he might have a vest on him
I'm from the Noya where a donk sit on Forgis
Ya gotta keep a .30 if ya ballin' like Curry
Sippin' lean, it got my vision blurry
Sippin' lean, got me movin' like a zombie
Got me reminiscin' when they tried to hide me
Throw away the key so they can't find me
[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Yeah I'm on my grimace, mezanmi
Let the Glock pop and I pop molly
Stopped sellin' rocks cause I love robbing
Whole life you been on the block grinding
Yeah, you just wanna pop free molly
That's the only reason you 'round me
No, you cannot get on my IG
This a selfie, stop tryna get by me
Let me out the cage, now I'm in ya broad jaw
Cool cat, I'm a mut, I'm a raw dog
I know all you niggas thinkin' I'ma fall off
I just took a lil' break, y'all need to calm down
We be strapped in ya city like it's our town
In the field, straight fonk a nigga outta bounds
How you snap a play then call timeout
Blitz ya runnin' back, knock the whole line out
Yeah, once the pressure on, you can't call off
Nigga hopped on the phone and brought the cops out
I don't sell drugs so I don't come out
I'm posted in the cut with the sawed off
12 gauge on me, I ain't pump fakin'
I'ma serve foolie like the lunch lady
I ain't catch 'em dancin' in the cut lately
Trust me, I ain't come to throw no ones baby
I'ma dump when the thump make ya jump, shake it
Grab the pole, strip a fuck nigga butt naked
And you ridin' police escort safety
I was in the gym, now I got court cases
Nah, you don't want beef, you don't want ham
Nah, you don't want me, you don't want nan
You don't ya whole meat knocked off ya cranium
Leave a nigga swiss cheese, rat terminatin' 'em5Embed"

Now, Minister Malcolm, the thing that I thought might be good for starting it off is to talk about one of the most pervasive beliefs in the general society about the Nation of Islam

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Talkin' to you like talkin' to myself
'Cause it ain't no gettin' through to you at all I swear
And I've been thinkin' 'bout you since I came to jail
I've tried to reach out to you, but it was to no avail
Guess it ain't nothin' else to do when we outgrew each other
We hard down beefin' like we never knew each other
Top off the coupe, no bikini, became our life now
I'm sippin' Bellini, livin' that lifestyle

[Interlude: Herman Blake]
And that is that it is an organization dedicated to the use of violent means to attain its goals. The question I have is, how true is this, and why do you think it persists in society?

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Poppin' pills, poppin' pistols, I put my mic down
I almost lost my life that night, I was on a bloodhound
They tryna tell us put the bikes up and the guns down
X was tryna buy a bike then he got gunned down
X was tryna change his life, but he got burned down
X wasn't ridin' with no pipe so he got gunned down
Listen, do as I say, don't do as I do
Nine out of ten, it ain't gon' end up lookin' good for you

Have never at any time been guilty of initiating any aggressive acts of violence during the entire 33 years or more that the honorable Elijah Mohammed has been teaching us. The—

[Verse 3: Kodak Black]
If I wasn't rich, you wouldn't be pullin' up to my funeral
First they kissin' you, huggin' you, then they suin' you
If it was me, it was you, I'm wonderin' what you would do
I just pulled up on your mama, homie, she beautiful
Yeah, gotta keep the strap, can't let you latch all on me
I got married to the game, she put these racks all on me
Now I got diamonds on my ring, look like a matrimony
First they screamin' my name, then file a lawsuit on me
You would hate to see me reach my full potential
You want me robbin', poppin' Mollies, poppin' pistols
I'm goin' to college 'cause to the youngins I'm influential
Thought it was Congress, they ain't know this was a Presidential
They ain't know that I was intellectual
You tryna change your life, but they won't let you
I know they know I'm special, why they playin' with me?
You talkin' jewels, I'm droppin' jewels, you see the difference
Coppin' jewels for your dawgs, they don't appreciate it
Everybody gon' say you fake when you make it
Back of the Maybach with the tints so you don't notice me
When the money bring the fame, you can't even roll in peace
Guess all the pain that I went through had to be the recipe
I stood tall through it all and brought out the best of me
Ayo, dismiss all them charges, that ain't my destiny
Everything I said, I stood on it, I got integrity
G.A., I put my hood on it, I bring the 'jects with me
You need security by your grave so you can rest in peace
Tired
[Outro: Malcolm X]
Charge of violence against us actually stems from the guilt complex that exists in the conscious and subconscious minds of most white people in this country. They know that they've been violent in their brutality against negros and they feel that some day the negro is going to wake up and try and do unto as them as they have done—do unto the whites as the whites have done unto us5Embed"

Watch when they find out me and you been gettin’ serious
Everybody ain't gonna like it when they hear
Girl, I don’t care ‘bout no fame, I make you famous
I don't care if that's the only reason you came for
These hoes always make me feel good, that money can’t
I can't find no love so I went to the bank
I was outchea looking for love so I went to the bank
We met at B.O.A and then we met again at chase
Every thug need a shoulder they can lean on
I like what's on your shoulders, good head you be thinkin' on
Speakin' of head, I hate sex but I love my peter blown
You're a lil freaky hoe but you complete me, though
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my bling on
I'm sorry when I fuck I leave my Rees on
See I'm a dog, I be just trynna get me a bone
He roam the streets alone you need to leave em alone
Stray dog, I don't need a home I don't be at home, I'm fleeing home
Raw dawg when I fuck her with no rubber but my ski is on
She heard I'm snot side nigga over there
She heard I'm snot sneaky nigga over there
They tellin' me she a thot, that hoe over there
But I don't even care if she have gonorrhea
They say she a sick bitch, I heard she got syphilis
But I'm going head first, jumpin' straight in it
I'm just kiddin' but I love that little babe
But I don't care if she a slut, she still my bae
And I don't need you telling me about how she do
She fuck everybody, and I fuck everybody too
Everybody say she out here trickin', I don't give a damn 'bout how she get it
Everybody say she got all the niggas So what? I got all the bitches
We got chemistry, fuck your history, I don't care if she was out here strippin'
I'm tellin' you baby, they ain't gon' like you jumpin' out that Bentley
Hittin' the scene in the Bimmer, I'm T-Double-D, you Trina
Everybody tellin' me she ain't shit, but nigga, I ain't shit either
And I don't give a damn 'bout none of that shit my nigga say
He tryna convince me he seen you on backpage
Everybody got an opinion, I don't give a damn anyway
I took her on a private plane, I took her on a dinner date
Everybody fuckin', everybody sinnin'
So what's wrong with turnin' that hoe into a princess
Yap, I can turn that hoe into a model
Scoop her in the Bentayga, no more Monte Carlo
If she ain't in a coupe with me, I want nobody in it
Bendin' corners wit' ya and my windows ain't even tinted
Babe, don't call me ese but I love it when we kick it
Fuck that he say, she say, it ain't nobody business
They ain't gon' like it, they ain't gon' like it
They ain't gon' like us, they gon' wanna fight ya
And I don't like people but I think I like her
I done let that hoe inside my heart now, wanna wife her
If I wife her I'm going Steve Austin with the ring
There's a stone cold diamond on her finger and it bling
I'm 'bout to cut off all my friends, I'm 'bout to cut off all my kin
Man, that pussy be pullin' me in, I thought it was a one night stand
I thought it was a one night stand like the lamp on my dresser
So she a lil dirty heifer, but this girl special
Thought it was a fling, thought she was a fling
I've been havin' dream lately, she might be my main
'Could you be my main? Could you be my baby?
Lifes gave me lemon, wonder could you be my main squeeze
Damn I fell in love with a nat
But every sinner got a future, and every saint got a past
So I ain’t even finna hold her accountable to that
'Cause baby see you ride, yo, that lil' bitch, she got my back
Baby she be ridin', that lil' bitch, she got my back
And when we ride, yo, my 'lil bitch she hold the strap
My nigga startin' cryin' when we went out in scraps
My babe more real than you, she one thou, keep that shit a stack
I don't throw no money, took my bitch to the club and threw some racks
Man with the plan, master mind my crafts, no more shootin' craps
I ain't no dog but call me Ken with the Ben, fucking on a brat
My lil bitch a brat, I hate how she act
But I love how she act, that my lil diva
If you keep it up I'm put you on a TV-show

Found my focus back, turned me to believer3Embed"

I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly

She rolled up on me, I was rollin' up my cigarillo
No, I don't fuck with Grabba leaf, I'm breaking down the elpo

Girl, I don't like the way your booty flop, it's like jello
And now I'm rockin Robin Jeans, remember wearing Ecko

I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen

I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen
That throwaway on me dumpin’ with precision
I know shawty only on my trail 'cause she see a ticket
I’m readin' between the lines and peepin' they intentions
Can't have you niggas around me, shit gon’ go to missing
I had to press that bump, I had to feel it
You know if it ever come down to it, a nigga with it
All these drugs got the whole world jiggy
Hoes comin' out they clothes and niggas trippin'
Why hit the top to go back to the bottom?
All these bitches fallin' for me like it's Autumn
I'm tryna tell you, homie, you don't want none
They freed me so I'm right back to that mon-yun
Somebody tell these niggas they don't want none
Kodak Black but I'm spreadin' blue hundons
They sent my nigga Cool on the fuckin' run
When they let him out of prison, I'll be 31
I knew I was a star when I was sellin' hard
Everybody told me I would make it when I was on the block
See, before this rap shit, I was jackin' cars
I couldn't get all my time 'cause I was doin' fraud

Took that bitch to Wings-N-Things, she wanted to be my main

Brown liquor made my dawg insane
Booted up or geeked, it's the same thang
Fish scale or molly, it's the same name
Murder by the stains, which gang you claim?
The big Patek face cost ten chains
Took your bitch out to eat on a private plane
Real talk, 150 when it's plain Jane
Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine

Ayy, free my nigga Cool, he in the chain gang

I told my nigga be smooth (cool), he put a potato on a barrel
I kicked her dumbass out my crib, say she want Chanel
I bought that bitch a lace 'cause she ain't got no hair
I sent that poor ass hoe a Uber 'cause she ain't got no wheels
Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry
Thirty clip in my Glock 'cause I'm a damn Warrior

Streets left me scarred, ain't no worries
Run my money up in a hurry

Before I had that Bentley truck, I was saucy

Me and Future gang gang, same thang
I check your temperature, nigga, is you hot or cold?
Like a state trooper, I make my money on the road
I remember hittin' houses, nigga, cash 4 gold
These streets made me lose my conscience, took a nigga soul

These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold

And they filling up they nose

Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match
That was voodoo, that was magic
Nigga be cappin', I just be laughin'
That was God, nigga was fastin'
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelets
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
Still finessin', still be poppin' fraud finagling and wangling
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women
It's my birthday, just turned 20
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
But guess what, bitch I'm home
On probation, but I still keep that chrome
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
And I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet
And I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck
Traded my ex bitch for a check
I'm takin' codeine with the x
I wanna buy my brother the world
But since I can't, I'ma get him a Lex
Ayy ayy, I'm a Israelite my diamonds is real ice
I had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight
I had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite
I had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light
Ay, I remember pourin' honey on my rice
Ay, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' in shacks
Ay, you got me fucked up if I'ma go out without a fight
Ay, this my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

You know life ain’t tied with a bow but it’s still a gift though
Yeah life ain’t fair but it’s still good though
It’s a blessing just to be here
Everything 1K

[Hook]
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

[Verse 1]
I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I’m in a damn cell
I’m in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don’t go that way
You prolly won’t last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I’m Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it’ll make you evil
How he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him?
Youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the Desert Eagle
Look how she left, I bet she told you she won’t never leave you
The same nigga was hating, I turned them to believers
I done made it through the rain and I ain’t called FEMA
[Hook]
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K

[Verse 2]
I probably thank God ‘cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I’m on MTV
Hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
Now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking ‘bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it’s crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can’t even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth
[Hook]
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way

DJ Swift on the track
My mama always told me 'bout that water, boy
Dubba-AA flexin'
She said, ""Boy that water deep, boy don't get in that water""
I still got in that water
This Is The Sound

[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me 'bout that water
And I said, ""Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in""
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water
I ain't never notice I was going deep in
Lately I've been working overnight
I can't party on the weekends
Like, why the hell you even in my life?
Tell me what's your real reason
I pulled up, drop my ceiling
I'm catchin' flights, you catchin' feelings
My diamonds wet, her pussy leaking
Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

[Verse 1: Kodak Black]
Like a kickstand I'm in here leaning
Them crackers let me out, swear it feel like I'm dreaming
Michael Jackson, yeah, that case I beat it
Fuck them hard slabs, now I sleep on Tempur-Pedic
I'm going hard 'cause my family need me
Mama said if I believe it, I can achieve it
Can't trust these niggas, they misleading
Can't trust these hoes, they so deceiving
I let him eat then he got greedy
I need a lifeguard, I'm in the deep end
I told that bitch I'm never leaving
I'm outta here, I'm going to Venus
My mama always told me, I ain't listen
So now I'm dealing with the consequences
I dive right in that water, went to swimming
Gotta watch out for these niggas, they be fishing
[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me about that water
And I said, ""Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in""
I'm sorry ma, I got right in that water

Ran up a check, then went to Neiman's

[Verse 2: NBA Youngboy]
Down on my ass, I had to get my feet in
They had told me change my ways but I ain't wanna listen
I looked my son in his eyes, I can't fail my mission
I say my prayers and tote my thang, I know they wanna kill me
Wake up in the morning, ain't got none' to eat
I had to man up to get on my feet
I go to Bay just to fuck with KD
Can't even swim but I'm deep in that sea
Got my first gun and I ain't pay a thing
Since I was young I've been slanging that heat
It be some massacres right on my street
It be some massacres right on my street
Remember they ain't gave me shit when I ain't had nothing
They want my spot but fuck them niggas, I'm focused on money
On everything, she say she love me I know she don't love me
3Three ain't round for to watch me, think I'm feeling something
My momma told me stack my M's, told me watch my homies
But I ain't listen Joe got shot, and he told on me
My uncle told me they ain't right, all them niggas phony
Can't lose it all for somebody who don't care about you
[Chorus: Kodak Black]
My mama always told me about that water
And I said, ""Okay ma, I'm just gon' put my feet in""

Can I ball? Can I chill?
Can I stunt?
Will I live long enough to raise my son?
Made something out of nothin'
Ain't nothin' where I'm from
Can your boy do something productive for once?
And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya

[Verse 1]
If I tell you how I feel, can I fuck?
I gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff
I'm really in the field so I need someone to hug
I'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love
All you gotta do is grind
It's gon' take time
Ain't no time to chill
Ain't no time to vibe
All my people wanted me to sit my ass down
But I been on go since I got off my behind
Everybody wanna shine
Nobody wanna grind
See my nigga workin' hard, that shit paid him off fine
None of this shit just fall from the sky
I'm puttin' in work, I done forgot that I was tired

Can a nigga eat in peace?
You leechin' for a crumb
Niggas ain't even showin' ya love where ya from
Them people took my 40s, so I'm about to go buy a pump
What if the trolls roll up on me right? Should I run?
Can I take you out to lunch?
I just wanna get you full then get all in your stomach
I just made shawty tell a man that she done
Lately she been tellin' me she love me, should I run?
I'm gone, I'm done
I shook and went describin'
I'm not a bad kid, I just didn't have no guidance
Fuck a home run, you boys be runnin' in houses
Robbin', connivin', wylin' and burglarizin'

This the amazin' true story of the youngest and most darin' conman
Tricky, swiftly, but yet viciously
It's always a mystery
Every day a new identity
I ain't talking cereal, but
I got all the tricks
Silly bitch, and I'ma finesse kid
Yeah, we ain't got nothin' for you tricks but some rabbit food
I could be ya professor 'cause I'll school ya
I shoulda been born in April 'cause I fool ya

[Chorus]
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets
Like really I shoulda been born on Halloween
I ain't no demon semen but I do evil deeds
My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 1]
Popping monkeys, popping bottles, make me swing
Who the fuck you walking in and out my dreams?
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be
Please, niggas free out here but they ain't free
You out here physically, locked up mentally
'Bout everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween

Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like the sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan

[Verse 2]
I'd trick so much individuals for a treat
K Boogie with a Hoodie, best believe
It's hot he got the hoodie on to hide the heat
And he got so much tricks up his sleeve
All the nights I had to mask up on the scheme
My subconscious got me fighting in my sleep
I can't forget about it I see it in my dreams
I'm kicking in your door, but I don't want no sweets
I'm giving you what I came for so I can leave
You know I'm serious don't you feel my energy
No this not a joke, everybody on they knees
Don't try to buck jack, you get buckeyed back

You ain't gotta be scared just respect a nigga please
I'm starting to think my cranium got a disease
They be like yo Kodak I just seen you on the scene
They be like I ain't approach you though, cuz you was looking mean
Don't need no friends I gotta big family
I'm a G, it's in my genes
Glock 23, it's in my jeans
You playing freeze tag but I got that beam
Sorry baby I lied, you was just a fling
I don't love ya, I just wanna get in yo jeans
Tricked her for her treat, tricked her out her panties
I can't get romantic
No I'm not satanic

Royalty can't buy you loyalty
Tell me, if I lose everything
Would you be over me?
I'ma tell you like they told me
This fame it ain't immortally
I ain't finna go switch oversea
Ain't no money controlling me
Black boy gave me a throwaway
I kept that shit, I ain't throw it away
Ten bands for the Jaguar
When I wrecked that shit, I remember that day
Been up, I been on my back
Now I'm up like an insomniac
Remember I made my first stack
When Wally had that Pontiac
Went to jail and I came back
Went through hell and I came back
Was in my cell, recreating myself
I died, and then I came back
Wondering where my partners at
Ain't write me and I acknowledge that
Snoop had me selling powder bags
He ain't even give me a dollar back
Later on, started sneaking shit in my pocket like it's contraband
Finessin' had me lookin' back at my profit, I had seven bands
Me, Mark, Greg, Tracy went up the road, hit for eleven bands
Project Baby, Taliban
It's Kodak, run and tell a friend
It's for my mama, she love me
She just want the best for me
Told me I should be in the booth instead of posted up on the ugly
Was in the club on that Hennessy
Now you see me sippin' bubbly
All the stripper hoes on me
I ain't even gotta throw money
I ain't even gotta throw money

Now my plate filet mignon
No more collard greens
Doctor told me, ""eat my veggies""
I'm smokin' broccoli
If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me

Now my plate filet mignon
No more collard greens
Doctor told me, ""eat my veggies""

If you wasn't in the trenches with me
You can't rock with me

I was cheatin' on my girlfriend
I fell in love with finesse
Now I'm married to the money, catch me stuntin' on my ex
Call it Smackdown, hit your bitch with the triple X
Need a Gatorade break, they caught me running up a check
Ever since a youngin', I been runnin' up the guap
Coulda ran track, but I was busy runnin' from the cops
I'm a young Haitian
VVSes in my watch like a Dalmatian
Bitch I got one hundred and one spots
Remember playing Lego, now I'm really on the blocks
Smoking loud, got my eyes so low I look like Fetty Wap
Jumpin' out ya window like Jeff Hardy
I'm a dirty nigga, boy, I got your bitch turnt up on molly

Yeah them niggas straight, but ain't no nigga like a nigga from Broward
Running out of mollies so I laced her up with powder

Hoe don't call me Kodak thought I told you call me Bill
You know a nigga clutching got to keep that thang concealed
Nigga what's the point of doing it if you ain't gon do that shit for real?

End of the night ended up with a body
Big booty bitch way bigger than Mizhani
While he heat kool with the whip like Desiigner
Why I hit the top to go back to the bottom
Now I got a lil one, I shoulda wore a condom
But now I'm happy I didn't wear a condom
Cause that lil nigga right there my blessin'
Three days after I lost my grandpa
Some told me to go take that test
And it came back mine
That boy mine, the people say 99.9
How you gon' pull up and crash the party?
I'll put the slug in your ass little buddy
How you gon' steal from your lil nigga?
How you gon' act like I wasn't with ya?
I can’t  do everything by myself
But I ain't gon' be outchea askin' for help
How the hell you gon' act like a housewife
When you know everybody know you a body

I be posted up in the yo like Gotti
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
Every time he step out he booted
Every time he step out it's a movie

Show me you different, show me you different
Show me you different girl, show me you different
How you gon' act like I wasn't there
How you gon' act like a nigga ain't care
I was on 1800 block all day
Nothin' was easy, had to get this shit the hard way
But I maintained, never complained
I'm true to the game, ain't never been a lame
Nigga I crewed up when I was nine
Got in these streets ,fell in love with the grind
I love the hustle
All of them nights I sacrificed, it only made me tougher
All of the trials, it made me wild
And tribulations, it made me wise
Tell my child don't fuck with them guys
We ain’t from that side, won't ont with them guys
I can't deny he got my eyes
I can't deny cause I'm not that kind
He don't even cry but he prolly might whine
I'm the jit on the school bus sellin' dimes
Why you gotta wish bad on your little whodie?
Put your ass on now you actin' all spoiled
Why you gotta talk down on your little homie?
Grandpa dropped middle of the testimony
Grandma died, guess he was gettin' lonely
Why I go HAM? Cause I don't eat baloney
Nigga you a phony, how you gon' act like you real?
How you gon' act like you trill?
Why you got the flag? A nigga already know the deal
How you gon' turn around and squeal?
Look at me leanin', I'm poppin' the seal
Look at my lips as I'm poppin' the pill, damn
Everybody acting like they my people
I don't fuck with you, I don't fuck with you neither
Woke up today went and copped a new Bimmer
Cuz a nigga got tired of the two-seater
I don't hear evil, I don't feel no evil
But I still walk around with the Desert Eagle
I just got me a referral from the teacher
Bitch I'm a Zoe, I don't do pledge of allegiance
Fuck you, lil' ho, lock my door if you leavin'

A wise man can play a fool but a fool can't play wise
Unless you judge me by my cover you can't read between my lines
I'm a street poet, poetical genius
Y'all need me, believe me
They ain't know that I was intellectual
Tryna change your life, but they won't let ya
I'm in Detroit right now
Just hollerin' at my nigga Wiz

[Verse]
I was hollerin' at my boy, he say he feel like he gon' die soon
Had to pray for him because he need it more than I do
How can I tell my people that's exactly the way I feel?
But I know that I'm blessed, so I won't give a bitch that idea
Runnin' from the Jakes, I was posted up with a 9 mill
Got me jumpin' gates, I got credit cards in my high heels
All my niggas fake, that shit kept comin' out like diarrhea
Syko on my line, I'ma pick him up, he in Liberia
Wiz, he just whipped up a brick and he ain't put no noodles in it
Told him I just caught me a fish, so don't put no tuna in it
They know that I'm baptized in blood, I let my soul sing it
Runnin' round wildin', I'm childish, I ain't got no home trainin'
Talking to my lil' boy, I promise won't let them boys kill me
Lookin' at my lil' boy like, ""Father, don't let them boys steer me""
Nigga tried to trap me, I saw it, they say that boy slippery
Niggas tried to trap me, I saw it, they say that boy slippery
Young nigga stickin' to the code, 'cause I don't condone snitchin'
I ain't goin' out like that rapper, I won't do no tippin'
Willie said my name on the TV, that boy a bold witness
On the news he T.I.P.’d me, that boy got no feelings
Suwoop put the pole on lil' buddy, they said The Game strippin'
Old heads ain't hittin' on nothin', I say them boys kiddin'
I want all the smoke out the stove, but I don't even roll Phillies
How the hell you callin' me out when you know I don't listen?
How you try and put me in timeout when I ain't Big Boy children?
Nigga waitin' on for me to fall off just like that boy Gillie
Said they ride for me 'til the wheel fall off, I be like, ""Oh really?""
How you tell me what came out my mouth, you don't even know Nipsey?
Tiny, that bitch ugly as hell, I don't even want Piggy
I can't beat you niggas at talkin', give me a long sentence
Know I keep the pole and I ain't no ho, I know some Rollin 60s
And I'm thuggin' all on my lonely, but I keep some Zoes with me
How the hell you cancel a nigga, and I don't even smoke tobacco?
Mute me when I voice my opinion, and I ain't even know it mattered
Jump right on my live and record me, everything I say be Platinum
Special kind of nigga, they know me, they want my name slandered
Special kind of nigga, they know me, they want my name slandered
My head right on the swivel, I'm focused, they want my brain splattered
How the hell you cancel a nigga, and I don't even smoke tobacco?

I like when you suck my dick while I drive
But let a nigga know is you really gon' ride
Is you really gone ride, even if they flat all our tires
Be hoppin cars and hotwires, till we get a brand new s5
I still fuck wit lil Robert he knew me since I was 5
Ain't even lookin at yo ass, I got my eyes on the prize
You ain't got lie to kick it, you can leave you can stay
And whoever told you that I needed you anyway
I ain't talkin bout no suit, I'll call a whole new case
I just wrote my nigga Cool like let me know if you straight
You be actin like you real but you know damn well you fake

When i was lost and i was lonely, where were you, did you care?
Don't be having me out here thinkin you for me when you there
You would hate to see me win, i know you want me to fail
Went to school got expelled, jumped off the porch i was 12
I ain't goin back to jail, no more thuggin I swear
You want loyalty but you ain't even loyal yourself

That's why my circle so tight, cause ion fuck wit you squares

My nigga slayed a nigga, I just came from hanging with him
I don’t know what really happened, I think he home invade the nigga
You never catch me out here clubbing unless they paid a nigga
Why the fuck I chase a bitch when I don’t even chase the liquor
Hell yeah they call me Kodak but I ain’t come to take no picture
So icy, make it blizzard, and I’m leaning sippin sizzurp
Lil Wiz, still be kicking doors, I call that boy a wizard
Damn, I was textin’ drivin’, I looked up, I wrecked the fender
Wally say boy you better get her so I blitzed her
No time to waste, therefore if I get her I’ma hit her
My mama say, baby you a winner not a quitter
Well not today, ‘cause mama soon as I hit her I’ma quit her
Cut the top with a scissor, turned my new car to a vert
I might need a new liver ‘cause my body full of syrup
Kodak Black, but I’m smoking purp, thinkin’ ‘bout cheesy purp
Rest in peace, Wayne Head and Purp, them boys down to earth
She know I’m a beast at every angle, you can call me Kurt
Flipped her over by her ankles, locked her and she called me Kurt
She know I be getting to the paper, I be putting in work
Up the road, playing with the papers, yeah I got that work
[Hook: Kodak Black]
I’m on that greedy shit, that fiendin’ shit, I need a piece
I’m on that wreckless shit, that selfish shit, I’m playing for keeps
Money hungry, I can’t spare bitch, I gotta eat
I keep that heavy metal just in case he tryna creep
I’m on that schemin’ shit, you better give me everything
I’m on that Demon shit, the devil know I keep that heat
You remind me of your bitch, I got you on your knees
Jeep Cherokee, I’m skiing with my dope boy wrist

[Verse 2: Boosie Badazz]
Take his bag then smash, what uncle telling me
Dirty pistol, dirty mask, another felony
Rocks in my mouth, I spit ‘em out when I was sellin’ weed
Choppers was tryna take me out at only seventeen
9 Glock, body rock, this bitch hold 17
Mouth wet, pussy hot, she just was 17 (too young for me)
Cocaine under my nails, working this triple beam
No fingerprints on my shells, too sticky from the lean
I’m on that greedy shit, it’s mine, I ain’t gon’ feed a bitch
Leave you leaking quick, one shot, one kill, Desert Eagle shit
I really got it out the mud, this ain’t no freebie shit
Guess how I got all my muscle, from deleting shit
Hard on the pussy, no old lady, I just borrow the pussy
These niggas thugging for the gram, gon’ record the pussy

Your address supposed to be a nigga’s ditch

Mr. Octave, do you accept your plea?

[Verse 1]
You know I'm a hot boy, but I ain't never lose my cool
The streets on fire, that's why I'm ridin' with my tool
1800 block boy, I'm quick to give a bitch the blues
I was already sentenced, before I came up out the womb
Streets done already sentenced me, before no cracker could
And I wonder why, when I'm just so fucked up out the hood
And I wonder why, these niggas be hatin' on a G
When I'm the same lil' nigga, who gave you niggas a chance to eat
I had to do that time, could nobody do that shit for me
When I was doin' that time, ain't nobody do that shit with me
I miss my nigga Cool, I know right now he prolly sleep
One day at a time, ten toes down until you're free
[Chorus]
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef, had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day

[Verse 2]
They gave Lil' Marcus twenty-five, that's my man (ayy)
Remember hittin' licks and runnin' up them bands (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Greg sixteen years in the pen (ayy)
For all my niggas locked up, I'm goin' H.A.M. (ayy, ayy)
They gave Lil' Ceelo twenty years, free my nigga
They say Lil' Tracy gettin' out this December
I dropped fifty-five bands from my hand
They done let me out, so now I'm goin' in
Before he go back, shoot it out with the police (ayy)
So that mean he goin' to court in these streets (ayy, ayy)
He goin' to trial right there where he stands (ayy)
For everybody did me wrong, I want revenge (ayy, ayy)

[Chorus]
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef,  had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape

Cuban on my wrist, Cuban on my neck, your girl on X
Money talks, she on the phone line, we havin' phone sex
Never duckin' from you peons, I ain't fold yet
Kept it real since the begun, I ain't told yet
I done finally got my muscle up, you know I'm gon' flex
People rootin' for the hustler, I think I'm on next
At your neck, I don't get tired, I ain't gon' rest
You gotta play your cards right, them jack boys on deck
I gotta keep the fan on, you know them girls gon' sweat
I'm tryna put my man on, but he ain't came home yet
Kodak Black but my hoe red, she get her own bread
I hit your girl with the pole, now she walkin' bowlegged
Dirty drink this that prometh, ain't sippin' Moët
I'm just tryna stay focused, ain't tryna go flat
You turn cold when the heater on, I know you're gon' melt
I've been smokin' broccoli, they say it's good for your health
Nah I'm good, I don't need your help, I do it myself
I know you don't really love me, you're just lovin' my wealth
It's lil Kodak, the finesse kid, walkin' like a lick
Hittin' licks, now I'm droppin' hits, mouthpiece cost a brick

Lock me in a box, but I'm comin' out swingin'
Watch 200 so I'm comin' out blingin'
Somethin' like the wind, can't touch, just hear me
Suckas can't see me, but they damn sure feel me
They say, ""Gucci Mane gone, the rap game ain't nothin'""
Soon as he left, the coke price start jumpin'
Walk around the club like I walked around the yard
Nigga I'm the trap god, you tryna look hard
I'll never ever ever ask the police to protect me
Never ever ever let a rapper disrespect me
Next up from Gucci Mane, gun clappin' gon' happen
Put a cap to the captain, see my bullets tap dancin'
Guwop!

Broward County, 954, we here, I kicked the door down
'Nolia boy shit, 1800 block, ugly corner, tied, gleeful

[Verse]
I was hopin' that you'd ride for me the way I rode for you
I wish my boy was here to see the man that I grew into
And I know if I'm feelin' like this, it gotta be mutual
But it ain't they business tellin' them the shit we surfaced through
Yeah, I won't never tell the world the shit I did for you
Even though you lied on me, that's cool, as long as you know the truth
I don't even feel the love be real no more, so I keep my distance
Remember I ran me up my millions, you was in your feelings
Even that time you shake my hand and you don't even grip it
But if I put that shit on blast, they gon' say I'm trippin'
I'ma just follow my intuition and I'ma keep on livin'
I wonder sometimes if you wishin', shit could've been different
Right now I'm cheffin', it's too late, I'm doin' my thing right now
I ain't lookin' down on you just chillin', I'm on the plane right now
I know you miss me, but don't worry, I'll never forget you
Even though you switched on me and it hurt me, I can't hold that 'gainst you
Takin' everything in me and it's burnin' for me to forgive you
You still my whoadie, still my dirty, but I ain't fuckin' wit' you
To create my future, I had to revisit my past, revisit my pain
But I won't never let you back in, we can't rekindle that flame
When he got stuck on and you blamed me 'cause you know I did it
Couldn't call on you when it was raining and it killed my spirit
All the shit you said, you tried to shame me, tried to kill my image
Even though you know me since a baby, and you know I'm with it
You know I'm serious, steppin' on niggas like I ain't even got no feelings
I'm in my cell right now, I'm wishin' shit could've been different
I ain't droppin' no names no more but nigga, I hope you hear it
Can't take nothin' back, it went like that, so nigga that's what it is
Everywhere I went, I took you with me, every show I did
Ain't say your name in all my songs no more, can't waste my lyrics
I said I was comin' home, they said, ""No you isn't""
I'm a real nigga, so I'm dyin' how I'm livin'
I remember throwin' rocks, now we goin' to prison
When I got my first Glock, kept that thing with me
You was with me on the block, thuggin' real silly
Jumped in the game, then I popped, then you went to switchin'
I tried to give you niggas shots, but you niggas missin'
Soon as Lil Yella got knocked, niggas went to snitchin'
I done been through a lot, shit you never didn't
I had to pop a nigga top to make that boy feel me
Crackers had me in the box, thuggin' every minute
Young nigga, see about me, I'ma show you different
All my life, throwin' rocks at the penitentiary
But now my watch got rocks, no more drug dealin'
And now my top gon' drop, I'm in a new Bentley
Heard foolie got shot, I wonder who did it
You my dirty, you and me, we made it from the mud
I been wishin' shit could've been how it was
'Bout you, I swear to God I would've took a slug
Down to kill a nigga 'bout you, and it's all love
This shit ain't about a stripe, this just what I'm used to
I'm down to throw away my life, throw away my future
'Bout street principality, no flag
Man, that soldier-like mentality automatic
I'm jumpin' out the pink-G truck with the ratchet
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy (Glee)
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy (Gleeful)
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy
[Outro]
Gleefully, that's how you present that shit the right way
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout, Broward County, 954
You know, we don't represent, we don't re-present
We present it once and that's what it is, that's how you step
Can't take nothin' back, went like that, so that's what it is
I wish it could've been different, though

I asked the Lord to send me a sign
I thought that I was blind
'Cause I ain't ever see the sign but the sign showed after time
And when I finally realized, it was too late to rewind
Guess I was just waiting on that sign
So I got up and went out on my grind
'Cause I used to cry 'cause ain't no food in the house
Seein' all the older niggas, man, they used to shine
Used to have the pretty girls and I just hoped that they was mine (Mm-mm)
Hypnotized, I was just nine
Black boy robbed a nigga right in front of my eyes
Rapping killed time, the years flew by
'Til I got old enough to run up on you with the .9
The light man, we became friends
I see him so much, he cuttin' off the light again? (Mm-mm)
I know his name, co-workers and his kid
He ain't comin' in the work truck, he comin' in his van
The more my stomach growled, the more I wanna lay a nigga down
Take yo' shit and make 'em cry
Mama got robbed in July, I watched her cry
So I don't care about yours 'cause they ain't care about mine
But look at me now, they told me, ""Settle down""
PBL charges got me waiting on trial (Mm-mm)
Oh, so you know now?
The sign read ""Never know until you find out""
The things I found out
But they don't understand what goes on in my house
Ain't no love if you broke
'Cause if you're broke, they treat you like a bad joke
They don't even wanna laugh wit' you
When you shittin' on 'em, you can make 'em do anything
They'll even wipe your ass for you
In this world full of fame and pretty girls
It can make your mind swirl
But you just gotta think, the devil, he gon' play
Get in your brain, have you runnin' in them banks
But now, I just want the world to scream my name
Don't even club, I'm the reason why they came (Mm-mm)
Takin' people shit, I'm the reason for they pain
Baker Act, I'm all the way insane
Poking houses, goin' crazy 'bout them chains
Them Cuban links and them rings
It's deep, the sign, I couldn't see
Man, look at me now, I'm gettin' weak
Damn, look at me now, I can't sleep
Oh, look at your boy, I can't eat
I'on think, ain't never think
All for some money, I might blow it all in a week (Mm-mm)
But it's Kodak, you niggas know that
I'm 'bout whatever and I'll hit a nigga like a road rat
But fuck that, right now, I'm chilling

I was in it, they say I'm a menace
Say I'm sleepin', and when I wake up I'll be in prison (mm-mm)

Give me a deal, give me mill' so I'm finished
Forget it, I'm still willing
To mask up and hit yo' granny for a penny
They say I'm stupid, say I'm foolish
Kamikaze, Baker Act, but I know what I'm doing
Fuck school, everybody on the campus
I did it so I'm ready for all of the consequences
Hard to trust a nigga, do I know you?
They hate lil' Kolyon, so paranoid, might have to blow you
Fuck a friend, family too, I'on know you

And I ain't finna let you ride my wave because I don't surf
It'll go down any second, you better stay alert
I'ma eat that pussy for breakfast, save room for dessert
I woke up and straight applied pressure out the gate

Because I be in my own lane, I'm tryna motivate

Every nigga in these streets know about me, they can vouch
I'm still wearin' Ree's like I'm still out here sellin' rock

Where you hop on jet skis, niggas ridin' on yachts

Love robbing niggas I got tired of the popo

You would think I'm blind 'cause I be rockin' heavy shades
I gotta keep the fire, try me, I'ma let it rain
'Cause I be walkin' round with a big scary chain
All winter I'm posted up, I'm sellin' candy cane
Before I made my move, I had to let it marinate
I beat the pot with the spoon and watch the dope lock up
I drop the 5 in the deuce like I'm Urlacher
Don't make me run up in your gig 'cause I'm a show stopper
I got 99 bands, I ain't got no problems
Ayy, repeat what you just said, you don't want no problems
I'm patient, when she give me head, I call her dome doctor
I keep a pep in my step like I'm pimp walkin'
I run up in your home like I'm Macaulay Culkin
I got lil shawty, on that reefer now she Kodak boppin'
When I jump up in a Beamer, I be thot hoppin'
All this Perc' in the liter got me sleep walkin'
I'm booted up, Molly Jolly, I don't need coffee
I'm tryna blow the fuck up, them crackers lock me down
They got me on the seventh floor, I'm tryna hit the ground
I'm tryna touch the promised land, you need to let me down
I put my trust in that bitch, that ho let me down

But I don't even care, I need you next to me
Can you see the best of me? Want you to marry me?
Would you say yes to me? Want you to marry me this year
Even get down on my knees, pull out that carat ring
And don't embarrass me, want you to marry me this year
Am I movin' too fast? 'Cause I'll slow it down
You the only reason I felt like puttin' down my four pound
You the only reason I ain't runnin' 'round with them hunnid rounds
Slidin' 'round in an opp's town, you the only reason I ain't locked down
I just wanna love you, baby, just don't make no fool of me
I know on your birthday I ain't gotta buy you jewelry
I know on your birthday I ain't gotta splurge you
Just because it's Christmas, you don't need a Birkin
And you all I want for Christmas

Free my nigga Jackboy we like Stitch and Lilo
I still be ridin' wit' fye, steering wheel on the right
I still be out of my mind, still be gettin' real high
I be on D'useé no lie, smokin' on cherry pie
I promise I ain't goin', that's that other guy
I ain't take no shortcut, this shit ain't come easy
Christian Louboutin is drippin'
When I step, I'm leakin'
Christian Louboutin, you would think I'm bleeding
They say that I'm next, don't jinx me
Eat it up, baby, then drink me
I ain't ever ask for nothing, my momma said ""Don't beg""
If you got it and I want it, then I'm on your head
My nigga been hidin' lately, he think I want him dead
But I don't want you to die, I want you to see me shine
I couldn't make lemonade, so I made lemon-lime
Life gave me lemons, so I made lemon-lime
Kodak that nigga that green, Kodak that nigga that slime
That money done gave me power, money done turned me sour
I remember I was rockin' Enyce, now I rock Givenchy
Run up on me, that's risky
Run up on me, don't tempt me
My tank on full, you empty
Smokin' on gas like Wawa
Project Baby, got Promethazine all in my baba
Free my nigga, Flippa my nigga, flip a nigga like Krabby Patty
Flyin' anywhere, my propellers be on aerobatics
All I know is rob, all I know is jack it
I ain't ever had no job, I ain't ever had no daddy
Dress it up, baby, like salad
Eat it up, baby, you nasty
Ain't got no snacks in the cabinet, just some goddamn ratchets
If Cardi be winnin', I'm winnin', 'cause that's my goddamn twin
If Cardi B win, I win
Cardi B won, I won
My bitch said she want her hair done, part in the middle wit' a bun
My bitch said she want her nails done, French tip, London
My bitch said she want her hair done, lace front, no bun

Got my mama out the bricks, she ain't gotta cry
Ayy, don't be fuckin' with my clique if you ain't tryna die

I be steppin' on these niggas, I don't rest up

Boy don't play with me, I don't play with kids, better go to school or somethin'
Boy don't play with me, I don't play with kids, little nigga, I shoot for fun
Money moves, these bloody shoes, I'm trippin' Christian Louboutin
Excuse me son, I beg your pardon, get from 'round me, smoking flocka
This is draco, this a baby choppa, I've been so angry doctor
Drop 8 ounces in my baby bottle, baby bottle pop!
I don't Nae Nae, I don't milly rock, baby I just Kodak Bop, I don't do no flock'!
I don't really do no feature, nigga I don't need no swap
I don't eat no broccoli, no mo' 'cause doc I smoked a canteloupe
I'm smoking KK, you smoke BB, I shot Dae Dae with a BB
I'm spazzin' on they asses, flex so much, got muscle spasms
My haters proud of me, 'cause obviously I'm who they trying to be
Make it so damn hard to copy they still try to copy me
Mouth full of gold since 10 years old I hit a lick up top for these
Everybody watchin me, jockin' my flows
Catch 'em out there went and dropped diamond teeth
If they ain't permanent pull 'em out your teeth, hop out with Shotgun Pete
Hoppin' up out the Jeep, hoppin' out, hop, hoppin' out with the heat

And I keep a mask on like it's Halloween, er'yday Halloween

This shit crazy, dog
My young bull was just with me last night
I shifted, dog, he got caught up
And the vehicle he was in had all my raps that I wrote when I was locked up a couple bids, you know?
1800 nights

[Verse 1]
I was just thinkin' 'bout family
Thinkin' 'bout Pop Hendley them
Don't say you love me if you don't mean that shit
And I'm thuggin' hard 'cause I mean that shit
I was just thinkin' 'bout my family
They been feelin' like I abandoned them
Why the fuck am I walking around here with a Glock for?
Nigga livin' dirty so I gotta keep the mop on me
Got a street sweeper, but I still keep the mop though
I put everything I got on
I ain't seen my brother in a week
I put too much time in the streets
Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma don't worry 'bout me
All you gotta do is love King
I hope y'all see what I be thinkin' 'bout
I'm smilin'
I just smile just to cope now
But I'm wildin'
I swear to God I'm tryin'
I'm tryna slow down
My people tellin' me to slow down
I fell in love with the fourth pound
You would think I'm with the Zoe Pound
Shoutout to ATL
But where I'm from we won't say ""12""
We say ""Tro-down""
The raiders out there just rolled around

Promise he ain't tellin' 'cause he G code
He ain't gon' tell ya if he know
If you 'round me
I promise if you 'round me, he's Zoe
He a zombie, he Zoe
A zombie on earth, I'ma Zoe
I brought hell on earth for these hoes
You my heaven on earth, you my hoe, baby
You my old lady
All them hoes hatin'
Well fuck what them hoes say
We rockin' Gucci with Dolce
Love my ol' girl, love my old lady

I don't know what I'm thinkin'
But I don't pop molly
I'm freestylin' don't mind me
I don't know what I'm sayin'
My chauffeur don't like speedin'
I like the Tesla better when it drive me
I can sit back on IG
I ain't gotta look up when the light green
I'm on the i- on autopilot, my bitch ridin' me
Cruise control
I thank the lord I ain't lose my soul
1800 nights I done sacrificed
Triple cross like Jesus Christ

You ain't understand me I'ma tell you twice
I'm ugly corner, even when I die
I'm wonderin' if you love me like I
I'm wonderin' if you thuggin' like how I be
Head first, is he runnin' right behind me?
Nah, fuck that, you better be runnin' right beside me
It's like everything that I touch, it just be fallin' apart
I can't leave my past behind me
I wanna know what's goin' on in the projects
I wanna slide and go see what it look like
Remember Pop hit a lick on a four wheeler
E Murder, almost lost his life on a dirt bike
I seen a cracker to my left so I turned right
I lost my re-up money tryna shoot dice
My niggas leavin' niggas stank for some hood rank
You ain't got no street cred, ain't got no Woo stripes
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas and my family
They the only ones that understand me
Pop the clutch, fishtail on the banshee
The Devil sent me a blessing
My dreads like devil horns, they don't know that I be on my damn knees
Forgive me lord, forgive me lord that I fell for it
Forgive me lord that I fell short
I'm dressin' plain in the airport
Bust a nigga brain if you care for it
Young nigga what would you do for it
Her boyfriend smokin' Newports
Just put my baby momma in a new foreign
'Bout to write a book, no Dr. Seuss, boy
I got stories like a news reporter
Like a book, put my momma in two stories
I'm postin' in the hood 'cause the school borin'

And I keep body bags for a rapper
Hidin' from my past, got me runnin' from a cracker

I should've never gave that hoe my heart
I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart
And if I see her, I might catch a charge
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart

[Verse 2]
If I see her, I might shoot the bitch
I should've treated her like any other groupie chick
I keep my heart pumpin blood, never koolaid
I'm up before the sun, ain't been sleep in 2 days
I told her my name Kodak, she said oh like blu-ray
All these niggas tryna follow me, I went a new way
That loyalty get you a long way
An I ain't never switch, ain't never threw shade
These niggas don't know how to play they role
They act like paper, all they do is fold
These streets ain't for lil kids, get out the road
That loyalty more valuable than gold

[Chorus]
That loyalty I take that to the heart
These niggas don't know how to play they part
It Never been no pussy in my heart
I always kept it real from the start
I should've never gave that hoe my heart
I gave her my heart, she playin' with my heart
And if I see her, I might catch a charge
I might shoot that bitch right in her heart1Embed"

I'm turned up on a jolly
I will milly rock on any block fuckin' Kodak boppin'
I will hit a nigga with that Glock, don't really do no talkin'
I will Diddy bop on any thot, she suck me 'till she coughin'
I will let it rip on all of y'all, just try me bitch I promise
Call me K, I got knowledge, keep the K cause I got knowledge
I be ballin' like Phoenix, but they say I'm hooked on phonic
You won't catch a nigga Tweetin'
I be schemin', I be plottin'
They be leechin', they be watchin'
She be geekin' off the molly
Call me K, I got knowledge
Keep the K cause I got knowledge
I be drippin', I be saucin'
I be limpin' when I'm walkin'
I'm so fucked up in the noggin'
I be hearin' bitches talkin'
Since I'm always fuckin' eatin' yams, wet the cutlass candy
You know I don't fuckin' give a damn, whack you and your mammy
This is orange, don't say tangerine cause I will get offended
I want Actavis Promethazine, don't want that shit you sippin'
And believe me, I ain't conceited
I'm just chillin', I'm just livin'
And so what if I'm conceited? That's just me but that's my business
Remember I was in a sticky one, reality done hit me
Boy these niggas will make you kill some, they always in they feelings
Nigga what would y'all do if you could be me for minute?
Nigga what would God do if we can fuckin' switch positions?
Aye repeat what you just said cause I was rollin' when you told me
Can't believe what you just said, bitch, I be rollin' in a stolen
A lil' soldier from the Noya
I can't stay from off the corner
I don't care none 'bout these foreigns, I'll pull up in a 'Yota
I was raised in a dope hole, posted on the stroll
Put a nigga in a choke hold 'fore I sell my soul
[Verse 2]
Can't keep these bitches off me
Now my bitch think I'm trippin', got her trynna stalk me
Think before I do the shit, false move will cost me
Got plans for tomorrow, been a man in kindergarten
I don't know you bitch, let me get your social
Got a power, stay in Boca and another on commercial
I would rather hit the fuckin' plug before I go commercial
Stop that Tweetin', I'll murk you
I be geekin' like I'm Urkle
Crackers came and got my uncle and he wettin' in December
I'm a come through bouncin' in that orange, you'll think I'm Tigger
Project baby, grew up in the park, you can call me Tigger
It's whatever, I'll rock a fella, and I'm on a jigga
If I ever meet Erykah Badu, I'ma fuck her
If I ever see you, out in public, I'ma touch you
Doin' me, stayin' busta free, I'll bust a busta
In a busted bus, nigga, my interior peanut butter
Shawty said that I'm a kid, prolly is cause I was beatin' her
Prolly not, it prolly is, really think that I'll feed her
I was in the DMV and I was runnin' up the meter
Settin' trends, goin' Super Saiyan, whipped out like Vegeta

I hit rock bottom
Thought I was never gon' come up bih
For real though, thank you Lord

Thank you lord I’m here, I never imagined this
It's Lil' Kodak Black, but bitch don't capture this
I ain't puttin' up with that, no I ain’t havin' it
Been showin' too much love, no more after this
They told me I’m a star, actin' like I’m average
'Cause I be rappin' but I don't be on that rappin' shit
I still be in the hood, tote my strap and shit
Stop that flaggin', that's how shit be happenin'
Last time I let you slide, I'ma whoop yo' ass for this
Save the choke sandwich in my mattress
Aye, where them yellow bones?
I don't want no black bitch
I'm already black, I don't need no black bitch
Put yo' hands up if you a bad bitch
Bae let's go and blow a check at Saks Fifth
I said ""I love you"", I was just on that yak bitch
Girl you know I'm bein' sarcastic
I bag her then I’m gone with that shit
Girl don’t call my phone with that and shit
Fuck it, I don't owe a nigga shit
I been out here thuggin' since a jit
Remember we was strugglin' in the bricks
Nigga had to go and hit a lick
I was throwin' rocks in the ditch
Now I'm throwin' rocks at the chaingang
I just wanna gain and maintain
Ain’t nothin' change, it’s still the same damn thing
New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road runnin', switchin' lanes
State to state, I'm breakin' the bank
Went to BOA then I went to Chase
Only hang around with niggas who gon' crank
Only hang around with niggas who don't think
Niggas out here takin' chances everyday
Niggas out here wildin' but they people straight
Can't say no to drugs, I be smokin' dank
Don’t let Kodak in here he gon' stink up the place
I'm so God damn high, I can't feel my face
I'm so God damn high, I just might stick up the place
First I start my day off with a wake and bake
I ain't workin' out but I be shakin' weight
Now my lawyer hollerin' ""Pay me""
'Cause I got court December 7th
Just in case them crackers slay me
Girl I'ma come and get you pregnant
Just tell my baby boy his dad a legend
Just don't let him be like me, 'cause I don't learn my lesson
I was already a felon once they let me out my mama belly
Got a telly in my cell, I'm smokin' reggie with my celly
Yeah I'm young and reckless
I just stole a Lexus just to flex it
Hit the scene, stealin' for no reason and I ain't even sell it
I'm a street nigga after paper
I be snappin', I be scammin'
They used to call me Lil' Duffle cause I'm a young hustler
Nigga I bring that check in
Uh uh
I'm a lil' motherfucker, I'm fuckin' on ya mammy
Slidin' in a Infiniti
Down here, we call that bih a FinFin
Yeah, man they leaked my goddamn song and I wasn't even finished
Young nigga, I'm dufflin', yeah, I'm gettin' to them Benji's
Mind yo motherfuckin' business
Windows tinted, I think this my car
I think this shit rented
Windows tinted, I think this a new one
I think this a rental
Everything orange, I'm smokin' cantaloupe
[Outro]
Thank ya Lord
I swear I ain't never expected this before
I ain't shit, so why you sendin' me all these blessings?
Roadrunnin', tunnel vision, I been speedin' with no limit for it
But I ain't never thought that it could get this far
First they wanted me to win, I had all the support
But once I won, they don't love me no more
'Cause they wanted me to win, but they ain't want for me to get this far
They say ""No, no I ain't mean for you to get that far""

22 hours locked down, ain't shit to do but think
I remember like it was yesterday, was drinkin' out the sink
I'm sittin' back plottin', I'm just sittin' back vibin'
A nigga can't complain, I had to use my time wisely
I'm sleepin' in a dorm, but they ain't send me off to college
I still got money buried from that lick I hit in Raleigh
I'm book-smart but the streets gave me all my knowledge
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the projects
So there ain't nun' for you when you comin' out the slum
A mouth full of gold teeth, they think a nigga dumb
I got a head full of dreads, think a nigga illiterate
But I know when I go to talk, a nigga'll reconsider it
I know you niggas just tryna benefit
I ain't fuckin' with you a little bit
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I ain't fuckin' with you at all
I was sellin' weed in middle school, just meet me in the halls
Right now I'm goin' in, but I was just behind the wall
This jail got me thinkin', I feel like everybody flawed
I got too much to lose, but I'll still go at a nigga jaw
I'm down for the count, I'm never down for the cause
I made a million dollars off of shows and goin' hard
[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I love money, I can't go back to the bottom 'cause I
Hate it at the bottom, try to stop thinking about it
But, I'm reminiscing, yeah

Fuck your problems, it's too late to tell me sorry
I pulled up in a 'rari, it don't come with no apologies
I'm reminiscing, yeah
I'm reminiscing, yeah

I remember everythin', I done been through everythin'
I remember who shitted on me, or who been in the paint
Like Ray J, got a bitch from the Bronx givin' me brain
Like Ray J, I done walked through the motherfuckin' rain
Right now I done got too far to give a motherfucker a feature
I'm the freshest man in high school, but I'm a motherfuckin' senior
Lil' shawty want to kick it, I told her I don't play FIFA
I jumped up out the Bimmer, now I'm slidin' in the regal
That pussy so tight but I be tryna go deeper
If she can make goulash, she a motherfuckin' keeper
Reminiscin' about my niggas, reminiscin' about my homies
I'm thinkin' 'bout my niggas, I'm thinkin' 'bout my whoadies
I don't fuck with Fooly no more but I still fuck with Koly
Got a booger in my nose, A Boogie on the chorus
A young nigga, I jumped off the porch, run Forrest
I'll lose it about that money, I'll go dumb for it
I'm workin' like a Mexican, fuck around and get deported
I bought my mama a crib, thirty clip in my forty
She said that my baby, I told that bih let's go to Maury
Lame niggas get extorted, if it ain't foreign then it's borin'

Keep my head on a swivel
And keep my mind on that money

It's okay, I'm straight

Had everything on wait

Once the road got bumpy, niggas went the other way
Everybody forsake me
Ain't no need for debating

Is it true or you faking?
I was gone on vacation
Now I'm back off vacation
And I'm like fuck, nigga, pay me
Gotta think before you speak
'Cause you don't know what you saying

Now I'm riding on Dayton's

Once you sleeping I'm waking
You know I love .38s
But I still tote the .380

All I got is me, myself, and I, yeah
Yeah, babe, me, myself, and I
Section 8 Taliban, yeah

[Verse]
All I got is me, myself, and I, got myself again
Time is money, I need that money, got no time for no friends
Ain't nobody gon' ride like me, cause I'm gon' ride to the end
Been in fucked up situations, where you niggas would bend
Play my cards, I never bluff, and I ain't throw in my hand
Shit, I saw when times got hard, I watched my nigga renege
He snitched, we caught that charge, I can't believe what he did
Cause he knew what we was doing before we went on that lick
I been rapping and snapping, I fell in love with this shit
It caught up with me, cause I be jacking since I was a litting kid
I been trippin' and goonin', and throwing rocks at the pen
All that sticking and moving, it got me doing a bid
Look, nobody gon' keep it real how I be keeping it real
Coulda snitched and got released, you know they offered a deal
Put myself in tight positions, I can't even regret em
I was scheming, times was hard, and I just needed some cheddar
My life a movie, it's Kodak, I'm the movie director
Sometimes it can scary, but I know it's gone get better
Remember when it was my people, them was gon' send me some letters
Cause I was missing my bitches, and I was missing my fellas
Hot pocket on me, so my pants keep fallin'
They wanna take me out the game, but I just keep on ballin'
Polo'd down, pop my collar, little nigga shot callin'
Could just hold up for me on the other line, guap calling
I'll get back to you later, I'm rollin' out of my tater
I been leaning so damn much, and now it got me disabled
Niggas grimey', be conniving', do shit under the table
Just last night, John John got yoked by the raiders
Fucking 'round on the ugly, hit that boy with a taser
Once I came out the womb, I jumped straight to teenager
They say I'm a demon semen, young boy, hell raiser
If I ain't pullin' up in a foreign, then I'm pullinga caper
Project baby paper chasing, tied, they dead flies
Institution
Run up on me, send you straight to your maker
All that kush that I be smoking, you think I'm from Jamaica
But hell nah, I ain't from Jamaica, bitch, I'm from golden acres
And I'll tag you with that 9, and that bitch got a laser
And I'll lay a nigga down, I'm like ""fuck nigga, pay me""
I ain't baking, but I'm caking, I should open a pastry
I got dope in the basement2Embed"

In the trap house with my partners, then we out here shootin' dice

Them niggas sweet 'cause I'm still in the streets
And they see me and don't even do nothing

Born stacking bread like the deli (I've been rich)
So you can take it where you want
I'm kamikaze wanna try me? Suggest you don't
Oh, I told you, boy, I'm riding the donk
Oh, I got shooters posted by my door
I'm from the Noy, yeah I stay Polo to the floor
Oh, my money long, I cut my homies short
From Golden Acres, what it is, it really ain't
I'm lyrical and what I be saying gon' make you think
I'm all in, I be solo, don't need no friends
I fuck with Lil Soto, that's my cuh-in-law, he get it in
Lil Jackboy, he just wrote me, that nigga he like my kin
I be up all night on M's, I don't fuck around with no Xans
Supercharged, I'ma hit the game like a ram
You niggas lame with a lil' fame on Instagram
I do my thing, I'm about to make you niggas flame
Ain't holding back no more, I'm finna make you feel my rage

You running your mouth, your lips bigger than your shoe

Oh, I can turn your state into a city
I'm a CEO, I can turn a Drake into a Diddy
Oh, 'bout to hit you niggas where it hurt
Why you go so hard? Why they put Wayne head all on my shirt?
I'm riding on 26 plus 4's, free Lil Turk
He just caught 30, that shit'll make me go berserk
Punchline, I hit the beat with a jab
The difference between me and you, I pull up in a Jag
Fingers inching like a rash, fiending for that cash
They say ""Kodak living good but all his bitches bad""
I ball so hard, my homie fouled 'em, my cast on
I rob so much, I'm in the booth with my mask on
Oh, I'm riding in the coupe, I'm the truth
That money running, I'm outchea chasing it, how about you?
You should get on a track and chase it too
I can turn a lake into a pool
My diamonds shining, why your ice look like it's blue?
While you out here lame vibing
You should be out here grinding too
They say time is money, I'm showing what timing do
Say grind turn into shine, I'm showing what grinding do
Lil Kodak Black, I'm the truth
Project baby, I'm the truth

You ever get the feeling that time is now to make a killing?
But you the only one that's standing 'round here with a vision

That's what I'm tryna tell my people
But my people don't wanna listen
We was brought up in a city where niggas, they hate on niggas
Bitches, they hate on bitches, and all of us is on assisted
Ain't watching my neighbor's paper
'Cause that ain't none of my business
Niggas can't get it in 'cause they worrying bout how I'm living
Me, I'm my competition
Me hit me on a mission
Me, I gotta get me, so I'ma make me be consistent
Fuck it, I'm all in, ain't doubting God's plans
Not on tour but I know they get easy in the end
23, I'm the man, I'm the fucking bird nigga
I done seen more chickens than Kentucky Fried Chicken
Ain't falsifying facts
Ask a nigga in my city who the first one to get 'em, to get down with them triggers
I am only one man but a different kind of nigga
Left the game without a stain like a fucking placekicker
Anything, any lane, any time I'ma get it
Put my all in it, when it's empty fall in it, fill it
Go hard from the start, from the start to the finish
Done it all, college ball, worked a job, ran a business
Broke the law, broke a heart, broke my foot up in some niggas
Stab me up and shoot me down, but you can't knock me off my pivot
[Verse 3: Koly P]
I'm a reaper, don't be hollering bout your people
I got a stick, it's a fuck nigga beater
Fucked the bitch 'cause I don't really need her
I'm on point like I'm blowing on Keisha
I get cheese like I'm going on pizza
White girl, Ricki Lake, Mona Lisa
Nigga go and get your people then
Ain't nothing, ain't tripping, we can spend a band
Yeah, niggas getting crossed every day
I was taught every dog got his day
When them bullets go to spark and the dog gotta lay
Better hope to God he don't jump with the K
Mr. DeLeon by the park they'll break
When you getting money, fuck niggas gon' hate
Only real can relate
Four years in the state
And I seen niggas break
Better watch your mouth nigga, jumping on your case
Niggas in disguise, they deciding off of hate
Chain gang now dying 'bout the case
Know some niggas lying locked behind gates
Surrounded by them snakes
They be all up in your face and
Tryna talk the fire and crack on statements
Don't pen the affidavit
Man I shouldn't have to say this
[Outro: One Grand]
4th quarter and we down by two
You gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter, 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?
It's 4th quarter, 4th quarter and we down by two
Is you gon' pass or shoot?

I thought lil shawty was the real deal and I guess not
But this the real deal? For real?

I was ‘bout to eat that pussy but that shit stank
Girl I want to eat your pussy but I just can’t
Smoking medicate help me meditate
You was so wack, I don’t wanna hear your mixtape
His diamonds so wet, he got it out the fish tank
I swear all I do is crank like I never think
I don’t think I just crank, I don’t hesitate

[Verse 1]
Let it spray, Kodak let it spray
I ain’t got to tote no 5, keep it just in case
Them niggas ever get out of line, put them in they place
‘Cause I be staying out the way, them niggas in the way
It Lil Kodak, I don’t rap, bitch I illustrate
It like I be painting pictures but I picture paint
So why they call you Kodak Black? You sippin’ Easter pink
I be right there at your house, think it’s trick or treat
I be drawing when I speak, see it vividly
I keep a 30 clip but this a Glock 23
Think it's sweet then come and see, I’ma demonstrate
Drop two ounces of codeine in my Minute Maid

You ain’t gotta like my music but you gon’ respect me
By the way when you approach me better come correctly
I be on that Little Caesar's shit, hot and ready
All the motherfucking bread, where the damn jelly?
I can’t understand these bitches, they so damn messy
I want to motivate them niggas but I got them jealous
Lil nigga I got big racks
I be flexing, wondering why I ain’t got no six pack
All this flexin’, I deserve to have a six pack
I stay finessing, break a nigga like a Kit-Kat
I stay finessing, break a nigga like a Kit-Kat

Booted up, Molly jolly, no Adderall
I got tired of eatin' PB&J, noodle casserole
All my niggas behind the wall
All my niggas, they in the pen
Or they in the grave
Flyin' in the dove, nigga, fuck a Wraith

This what it sound like
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Look what it sound like when a vulture cry
Booted up, I'm high, booted up out my mind
I'm booted up out my mind

When my niggas died, I was tryin' to cry
When my niggas died, I couldn't even watch you cry

[Verse]
Jumped up out the womb like my daddy the devil
My son jumped up out the womb like his daddy the devil
Life's been better
I thank the Lord life's been better
Ever since I dropped up outta school, nigga, life's been better
Since I ran out with the tool just to get me some cheddar
Had to jump out on a fool, whacked him, teach him a lesson
Lil' nigga, I ain't sparin' you, so I don't need you to spare me
I had jumped up off the porch headfirst, I was ready
'Bout that fetty, take a nigga ass away from his family
To hear my nigga tell it, man, that shit damn embarrassing
Go back to hittin' licks, got me thuggin' in Maryland
Smokin' gas, got my tank on 93 supreme
Smokin' gas, drinkin' oil, no kerosene
Had to fill all my guns up with blackheads
Fill my guns up with diamonds, so I run the biz
Fill my gums up with diamonds, look like gingivitis
All this money got me lookin' like Illuminati
He done caught his first body, swear he did enough
You can't tell him nothin', feel like he a real thug
Even in the rap shit, I get real love
But how you knowin' real love when you ain't got a feeling?
What you know about trust when you not feeling?
I came up, now they pay a nigga top penny
Birdman tryna give the kid a couple million
Before Atlantic Records signed me, I was gettin' chicken
I was scammin', I was plannin' on the same dream
I got tired of baloney sandwich, no canteen
Got tired of PB&J, noodle casserole
I drink the coffee with the Molly, no Adderall
I guess someone not different than him after all
Stayin' focused on the cheddar, I be spazzin' now
Why you think they call him Kodak Black? I be blackin' out
These niggas want me in the box like I'm Pacquiao
Losin' all my niggas, started drinkin' alcohol
I jumped out the womb like my daddy the devil
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm clever, yeah
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm special, yeah
I got a couple million, also tote a Beretta
I dropped out of school just to get me some cheddar

Hell yeah, they call me Kodak, but I ain't come to take no pictures
So icy make it blizzard and I'm leaning sipping sizzurp
Lil Wiz still be kicking doors, I call that boy a wizard
I was texting and driving, I looked up, I wrecked the fender
Why they say, boy you better get her so I blitzed her
No time to waste, therefore if I get her I'mma hit her
My mama say, baby you a winner not a quitter
Well not today, cause momma soon I hit her I'm a quit her
Cut the top with a scissor, turned my new car to a vert
I might need a new liver ‘cause my body full of syrup
Kodak Black, but I'm smokin' purp, thinking 'bout chief the purp
Rest in peace, wayne hit a perc, new boy down to earth
She know I’m a beast at every angle, you can call me Kurt
Flipped her over by her ankles, locked her and she called me Kurt

I'm sliding in that cutlass just because
I pray to God my son won't be a thug
You know I'm on the grind
I don't even get to see him
You know my baby momma
She don't even let me see him
On the track I gotta rhyme, nigga, onomatopoeia
I'm sipping champagne I ain't gotta pop a pill
Wolve stripes in my body, I hit that nigga up
Wolve stripes got my rifle everythin' I did before
No peroxide, but I'm sitting in the cut
With my cousin Popeye at the top
It's just us
I'm jumping out the Wraith
Remember riding on that bus
I shook my old bih because all she wanna do is fuss
I need gratitude, Im on a different latitude
If you run up on me then I’ma bag a dude
Gratitude, and you know I’m straight dumpin' it
Got all the cheese
But I ain’t talking ‘bout government
I was hollering at the jitterbug
He said you wanna rap too
He said you wanna have plenty love
Matter fact he in the booth with me
I don't fuck with E-Murder
He almost died on that 250
But you know I still pray for him
I'll still load up and go spray for him
I don't wanna hit the chain gang but been in and out
I'm 19, but I was a baby when I jumped off the porch
I quit basketball just to thug the fucking block
I was jacking cars going to juvenile in and out
You would think I do construction
I was out here selling rocks
I was in the rap game, but i was still on the block
I was sitting in a cell when Enale got shot
That's my cousin
Swear to God it would have been different if I was out
My nigga Wyjib died, it took a lot not to cry
I was in cell reminiscing about all the times
We was out her kicking door in
We was out here on the grind
You would pop a xanax, quick to pop a nigga top
Call a nigga polka dot we will run up in you spot
Like a nigga tying shoes, tie that paper into a knot

Almost threw away my life

You know I needed you, why would you leave me?
Keeping it real every day, it ain't easy
Sorry this ain't orange, this is peach
Gotta keep a carbine in my reach
Pickin' calamari out my teeth, baby

[Chorus]
This is peach
Gotta keep a carbine in my reach
Pickin' calamari out my teeth, baby
Why you put them Forgi's on a Jeep?
I keep spilling coffee on my jeans
I don't like you talking, I'm gon' squeeze, baby

[Verse 1]
You know I needed you, why would you leave me?
Keeping it real every day, it ain't easy
Cardigans sweater, it come out next season
Deja Rae, would you just stay with me, please?
I'ma bless lil' mama like she sneezin'
Scored a triple-doublе for my nieces
I just bought a Rover for no rеason
I'm on house arrest, I can't even leave
Locked up in the pen, but I ain't peter
The water dripping off me, Aquafina
Love my Uncle E and Uncle Beanie
Love my Auntie Krista, Auntie Nina
Blowing all this money 'cause it freeze
Scamming in Miami by the beach
Telling on your homies, that ain't Z
Boy, I heard you ratted for a cheesecake
[Chorus]
This is peach
Gotta keep a carbine in my reach
Pickin' calamari out my teeth, baby
Why you put them Forgi's on a jeep
I keep spilling coffee on my jeans
I don't like this talking, I'm gon' squeeze, baby

[Verse 2]
Snipers in the Benz in lil' Haiti
Sipping on the lean but I ain't lazy
Deja Rae, bae, check your savings
Skeeted on her face, she say ""Don't waste it""
I been smoking coffee with the weed
I'ma keep you healthy selling P's
Devil wanna sign me, what's the plea?
Double nines on me, I'm from 18th
Louis V peach-colored blanket
Dogging on these bitches, I got rabies
Hitting her from the back, I told her face me
I been getting a lot of money lately
Cardi B, I hope you like your bracelet
Shawty say I'm handsome for a Haitian
I just rent the Spider for the weekend
Lying on my dick but it ain't shrinking
[Chorus]
Sorry, this ain't orange, this is peach
Gotta keep a carbine in my reach
Pickin' calamari out my teeth, baby (Yuh)
Why you put them Forgi's on a jeep
I keep spilling coffee on my jeans
I don't like this talking, I'm gon' squeeze, baby, yeah

[Verse 3]
Cracka tryna tell me go to sleep
I been writing lyrics after 3
Brother told me fuck it stick to rappin'
Everybody know you 'bout yo action
White girl say she feeling peachy
I still smell the pussy on my pinky
Bae that pussy taste like, tangerine

[Chorus]
Sorry, this ain't orange, this is peach
Gotta keep a carbine in my reach
Pickin' calamari out my teeth, baby
Why you put them Forgi’s on a Jeep
I keep spilling coffee on my jeans
I don't like you talking, I'm gon' squeeze, baby, uh6Embed"

It's like fuck it, I'm just misunderstood
That's the story of my life

[Chorus]
I don't like talkin' to you, niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you, niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family

[Verse 1]
I keep this tool on me like I done turned into a mechanic
I'm a fuckin' CEO, I don't need no damn manage
I don't like no interviews, see y'all don't speak my language
We can't hold no conversation, you don't know what I'm sayin'
She say she wanna know the real me, bitch I am it
Tell the blog ""correct that shit,"" 'cause I ain't from Miami
I don't even speak code, when I do, I'm misinterpretated
I don't even need no surfboard, I'm too fuckin' wavy
I ain't take my meds bitch, 'cause I ain't fuckin' crazy
Say you thuggin' a lil' too hard, life you livin' dangerous
They don't see potential, they say I'm a project baby
Just 'cause my dad so goddamn selfish, he ain't wanna raise me
[Chorus]
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family

[Verse 2]
I'm on 18, I'm slangin' like I'm Peyton Manning
My bitch just told me to be more gentle 'cause I'm too demanding
They say that all my demons seeming, but I'm not satanic
And I keep her back wet but shawty ain't Hispanic
I see you in peripheral vision through my Prada lenses
No point in goin' to school if I'ma keep on jumpin' fences
The block too hot and that's the only reason I'm on campus
It's a pandemonium ridin' panoramic
Once they let me out of jail I went back to the dentist
I snapped my golds out and flood my gums with VVS's
Yeah, you listenin' what I'm sayin' but you don't get the message
Did so much dirt I wonder how I still be gettin' any blessings

[Chorus]
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me

Couldn't even make it out my home, I was over thinkin'
Am I depressed or stressed, 'cause I don't even know the meanin'
Ain't got nothin' to say but why I'm jumpin' on the beat then?
Never personal, it's business, that's the way I keep it
Hollered at my clergy, he love me like his own semen
Just dropped a album but I still ain't got no time for sleepin'
I might wake up, drop a mixtape for no reason
Influence you lil' niggas, happy that you wanna be me
Know you fake, Instagram page told ya secret
No booty shakin' music when you pop my CD in
Play a crook by the book, I'm sittin' back readin'
Real recognize real, but looks can be deceivin'
I still fuck with Young Money, I'm just CMB'n
Miss my Audi, in a different Audi every season
Can't believed they flipped the Audi that I used to sleep in
Thug to the bone, you can't roll if you anemic
Brought hell on earth, my hoe know I'm cheatin'
I'm a zombie on earth, Z.O.E'n
I brought hell on earth, H.O.E'n
Zoe shit, ain't no hoe shit, I ain't H.O.E'n
I'm runnin' in the phone store, AT&T'n
I just found out my nigga a hoe, I can't believe it
'Cause I don't know the gender
Do I pimp her, do I G him?
You a transgender, I'm a wolf in sheep skin
So you was fakin' nigga?
You sit down when you peein'?
Caitlyn Jenner, shoot you in yo' legs cause you a lesbian
More stripes than Tyga, I want Kylie Jenner, tell her come with me then
It get greater later, wish my nigga was home to see this
I coulda been in Pluto but I got her sewed up in Venus
Future want me Freeband Gang, I can't 'cause I'm SG'n
Sleepin' and I'm geekin', sometimes I don't even feel like breathin'
How the hell I'm in a cell?
Was I ever home or was I dreamin'?
Woke up seen a demon
Walkin' like I'm Jesus
I pay lawyer fees, you just tweetin' ""Free My Niggas""
I post commissary, I don't need to post a picture
Woe I'm in yo' corner 'til the world blow, I'm with ya
But I hope that I don't go broke again, nigga I'm killin' young babies
Kodak never goin' broke again, nigga you a free agent
Better have that same energy when you see me cause I'm goin' super saiyan
Reminiscin', wishin' my lil' brother wasn't incarcerated
Ya birthday Sunday, we just always end up locked up, ain't it?
With me on MTV on the red carpet, two lil' project babies
Yeah, at the VMA's we was the only ones taken
When this shit gon' end? I get out, you go in, it's crazy
[Outro]
Silence keep cloudin' me
Hands on my heart, it's soundin' like it's poundin' like the beat
Time never mattered
Time is money, I wish I could buy back all the time I gave away for free
Tunnel vision now, cause they was cloudin' me
I'm feelin' on my chest, I coulda sworn I felt my heart just beat
Yeah, time is money, diamonds on my Audemar
I can't keep makin' the system richer, they keep takin' time from me3Embed"

Alright, I got, I know how I'mma start this
Dyryk, when we link up, man, we legendary

[Verse]
They be hatin', they be lyin' on me, too
Got a tiger and a lion on me, too
All this Gucci got me lookin' like a zoo
All this water like I'm divin' in a pool, yeah!
All this jewelry, swear to God that I'm a jew
They want me stuck back in the projects like I'm glue
I be slidin' with my 5 'cause I'm too cool
I put your head right on a platter, now you food
She said if I don't keep bein' lit, she swear it's over
She told me if I stop bein' rich, she swear it's over
My nigga be jellin', he be hatin', and I know it
He ain't never tell me, he don't say it, but he show it
Dyryk, don't you stop the beat, my nigga, keep goin'
Dyryk, don't you stop the beat on me, just keep recordin'
I'm finanglin' and wanglin', finessin' gettin' boring
Bought my mom a new three story 'cause we made it out the storm
We got shelter now, doin' better now, feelin' warm
Bought my mom two billy goats, but we gon' eat it if we starvin'
Take a shit right out the door, 'cause I can, and this my yard
Perpendicular my perimeter, all these acres like a farm
And I'll be honest, I'm the G.O.A.T., I was born right in the barn
Woke up feelin' like it, dropped 100 on the Audemars
Cash for gold, I got a pot gold, look like leprechaun
I be hittin' houses, run up in your home, Barry Bonds
Bombs over Baghdad, Sniper Gang Taliban
Ain't never had no damn dad, just my brothers and my mom
Bringin' tears to her eyes, I make her cry like it's fun
I threw away my life a thousand times, but not no more, I'm done
I'm out here packin' iron on Valentine's, I'm thuggin' 'cause it's fun
Make yo' daughter cry on Valentine's, that lovin' shit be dumb
I'm a cowboy for real, my momma call me Bill
Bought her a new crib with a shark and a eel
Look at all the drills, I'm spreadin' Gonorrhea
I was shittin' on her last year, now I diarrhea
All this ice around my wrist, I got the chill
That's why I bought this ice, it's just so I could chill
She be barfin' on my dick, I be like ""ew""
I need a heart transplant so I could feel
I drop diamonds on my ear so I could hear
She be gobblin' on my dick just like a meal
I dropped six thousand on my pupils, now my vision clear
Fuck Bonnie and Clyde, she say if I'm Bill, then she Jill
On a pill, holdin' on a seal
On a pill, rollin' off a hill
I'm on a pill, I need Zephrhills
You turn me on, I love them sexy heels
I'm a grim reaper, make a pussy nigga pay a due
Before I was on BET, I already made the news
I'm pullin' tricks, work go ka-poof like Houdini, who
I be swaggin', you think I know magic, you think I do woo
More stripes than Adidas, I ain't human, I'm a creature
My brother, he a Z, that's my zebra
And we havin' more stripes than Adidas
Fuck the money, nigga, if I don't like you, we can't do no features
Fuck the teacher, I be breakin' rules
Fuck the teacher, they kicked me outta school
Jumped out on that fu, then I peeled off in a coupe
Paint the Cutlass orange, so I peel off like a fruit
All the money look like soup, I be gettin' to the stew
Valentine's Day, but I don't love you, April Fool's
Banana clip on my pack, so I be Bathing Ape
I'm a monkey, got me swingin' with my tool, goin' orangutan1Embed"
