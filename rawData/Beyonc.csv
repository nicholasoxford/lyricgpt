I've been drinkin', I've been drinkin'
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinkin', I've been thinkin'
Why can't I keep my fingers off it?
Baby, I want you, now-now
Why can't I keep my fingers off you?
Baby, I want you, na na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feelin' like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashin' lights, flashin' lights
You got me faded, faded, faded
Baby, I want you, na na
Can't keep your eyes off my fatty
Daddy, I want you, na na
Drunk in love, I want you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
We woke up in the kitchen
Saying, ""How the hell did this shit happen?""
Oh, baby
Drunk in love
We be all night
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies
Grindin' up in that club
Drunk in love
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body
So fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinkin', park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbin' on it, rub-rubbin'
If you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinkin', get my brain right
Armand de Brignac, gangster wife
Louis sheets, he sweat it out
Like washrags, he wet it up
Boy, I'm drinkin', I'm singin'
On the mic to my boy toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway
Then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Grainin' on that wood
Grainin'-grainin' on that wood
I'm swervin' on that, swervin'-swervin' on that
Big body been servin' all this
Swerve, surfin' all in this good-good
Hahaha!

I'm nice right now… Hold up!

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
That D'USSÉ is the shit, if I do say so myself
If I do say so myself, if I do say so myself
Hold up, stumble all in the house
Time to back up all of that mouth
That you had all in the car
Talkin' 'bout you the baddest bitch thus far
Talkin' 'bout you be reppin' that Third
I wanna see all that shit that I heard
Know I sling Clint Eastwood
Hope you can handle this curve, uh
Foreplay in a foyer, fucked up my Warhol
Slid the panties right to the side
Ain't got the time to take drawers off
On sight, catch a charge I might
Beat the box up, like Mike in '97, I bite
I'm Ike Turner, turn up, baby, no, I don't play
""Now eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
Said, ""Eat the cake, Anna Mae!""
I'm nice, for y'all to reach these heights
You gon' need G3, 4, 5, 6 flights
Sleep tight, we sex again in the morning
Your breasteses is my breakfast
We goin' in, we be all night

I'm never tired, never tired
I been sippin', that's the only thing
That's keepin' me on fire, we on fire
Didn't mean to spill that liquor all on my attire

Can't keep your eyes off my fatty

Say, ""Hey, Ms. Carter!"" (Hey, Ms. Carter!)
Give me some!

[Verse 1]
See me up in the club with fifty-'leven girls
Posted in the back, diamond fangs in my grill
Brooklyn brim with my eyes sitting low
Every boy in here with me got that smoke
Every girl in here got to look me up and down
All on Instagram, cake by the pound
Circulate the image every time I come around
G's up, tell me how I'm looking, babe

[Bridge]
Boy, this all for you, just walk my way
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
Just tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking, babe?)
I do this all for you, baby, just take aim
And tell me how it's looking, babe
(How it's looking, babe?)
Tell me how it's looking, babe, looking, babe
[Verse 2]
Drop the bass, mane, the bass get lower
Radio say ""Speed it up"", I just go slower
High like treble, pumping on the mids
Ya man ain't ever seen a booty like this
And why you think ya keep my name rolling off the tongue
'Cause when he wanna smash, I'll just write another one
I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker
Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor

Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees
Took forty-five minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh, he so horny, yeah, he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky'd all on my gown

Oh there, daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh, baby, baby, we better slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
And we ain't even gon' make it to this club

He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping, trying not to crash

Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe?

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C—Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-dah-de-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com—Com—Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-dah-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)

What is it about you that I can't erase, baby?
When every promise don't work out that way, no, no, babe
When every promise don't work out that way

And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty, enough?

Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

What is your aspiration in life?
Oh, well, my aspiration in life would be... to be happy

Mama said, ""You're a pretty girl
What's in your head, it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters""

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation
Pretty hurts, pretty hurts

We shine the light on whatever's worst
We try to fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs a surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest

South beach, sugar free
Vogue says thinner is better

This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down, down

Ain’t got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far
Then you break when the fake façade leaves you in the dark
You're left with shattered mirrors and the shards of a beautiful past

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worst
Perfection is a disease of a nation

But you can't fix what you can't see

And you're lying in your bed

And I've been drifting off on knowledge
Cat-calls on cat-walks, man these women getting solemn
I could sing a psalm for a Solomon or Salamander
We took a flight at midnight and now my mind can't help but wonder: how come?
Spoon-fed pluralized eyes to find the beaches in the forest
When I'm looking off the edge, I preach my gut it can't help but ignore it
I'm climbing up the walls cause all the shit I hear is boring
All the shit I do is boring, all these record labels boring
I don't trust these record labels, I'm torn
All these people on the planet working 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive
The 9 to 5 just to stay alive, the 9 to 5 just to stay alive

I cooked this meal for you naked
So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass
Don't make me break it

So you could feel this feeling
I never broke one promise
And I know when you're not honest
Now you got me yelling, that's because I'm jealous

Oh, I'm jealous
If you keeping your promise, I'm keeping mine

Yoncé fillin' out this skirt, I look damn good, I ain't lost it
And I ain't missed a beat, boy, you been hanging out at night

Dancing on them tables, ain't got no cares, no sorrows

I can do for you what Martin did for the people
Ran by the men, but the women keep the tempo

Still play my part and let you take the lead role, believe me

I see your hustle with my hustle, I can keep you
Focused on your focus, I can feed you

You need a real woman in your life (That's a good look)
Takin' care of home and still fly (That's a good look)

When you're in them big meetings for the mills (That's a good look)
You take me just to complement the deal (That's a good look)

I be's the d-boy who infiltrated all the corporate dudes
They call shots, I call audibles
Jacob the jeweler, baubles, Lorraine Schwartz oughta do
It's big ballin', baby, when I'm courtin' you
I'm talkin' spy bags and fly pads
And rooms at the Bloomberg, and rumors
You on the verge of a new merge
'Cause that rock on your finger's like a tumor
You can't fit your hand in your new purse
It's humorous to me, they watchin' and we just yachtin'
Island-hoppin' off the Amalfi coast
Mafioso, Hov, baby, you ever seen Saturn?
No, not the car, but everywhere we are
You sure to see stars, this is high-level
Not eye-level, my bezel courtesy of Audemars
I order yours tomorrow, now look at the time I saved you
Mama, let me upgrade you (He-he-he....)
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Just when you think we had it all
Big ends, condos, collecting cars
Picture your life elevatin' with me
You my project celebrity
I keep your name hot in them streets
But it's that little glimpse of light
That makes a diamond really shine
And you already is a star but, unless you flawless
Then your dynasty ain't complete without a chief like me

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Partner, let me upgrade you, Audemars Piguet you (Whoo)
Switch your necktie to purple labels
Upgrade you
(I can) up, (Can I?) up, (Let me) upgrade you

Introduce you to some new things and
Upgrade you

I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'

Baby, I love you
You are my life
My happiest moments were incomplete if you weren't by my side
You're my relation, in connection to the sun
With you next to me, there's no darkness I can't overcome
You are my raindrops, I am the seed
With you, and God, who's my sunlight, I bloom and grow so beautifully
Baby, I'm so proud, proud to be your girl
You make the confusion go all away from this cold and messed up world

[Chorus]
I am in love with you, you set me free
I can't do this thing called life without you here with me

And I know you love me
Love me for who I am
'Cause years before I became who I am
Baby, you were my man
I know it ain't easy, easy loving me
I appreciate the love and dedication from you to me
Later on in my destiny, I see myself having your child
I see myself being your wife, and I see my whole future in your eyes
The thought of all my love for you sometimes makes me wanna cry
I realize all my blessings, I'm grateful to have you by my side

Not just some words in a bible verse
You are the living word

Bigger than the picture they framed us to see
But now we see it
And it ain't no secret‚ no

Understand that truth about that question in your soul
Look up‚ don't look down, then watch the answers unfold
Life is your birthright, they hid that in the fine print
Uh‚ take the pen and rewrite it

Step in your essence and know that you're excellent
Rise (Rise), the spirit is teachin'

But I promised you I would fight, so I fight

Let's go get 'em (Uh-huh)
C'mon (C'mon)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z & (Beyoncé)]
I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like Birkin Bags
Now I bag B. (Boy, you hurtin' that)
Brooklyn Bay where they birthed me at
Now I be everywhere, the nerve of rap
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to sting, stand back

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Baby, seem like everywhere I go, I see you
From your eyes, I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly, I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go
[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu
Know that I can't get over you
'Cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute
Baby, I swear it's Déjà Vu

[Verse 3: Beyonce]
Seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkin' past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
Feels like I'm losin' it

Boy, I try to catch myself, but I'm outta control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

And I don't want no substitute

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl. you should already know
It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gon' need help tryna study my bounce
Flow, blow, what's the difference?
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dope, po-po try to convict him
Thats a no-go, my dough keep the scales tippin'
Like 4-4s, like I'm from the H-O-U-S-T-O-N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argu-a-ment
I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a factory
I'm just one of one, nothin' after me
No Déjà Vu, just me and my... (Oh!)

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
Baby, I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having Deja Vu
'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missin' you
That I'm having Déjà Vu?

She gon' be rockin' chinchilla coats

Damned if I let you go

Tell me how should I feel
When I know what I know
And my female intuition
Telling me you a dog
People told me 'bout the flames
I couldn't see through the smoke
When I need answers, accusations
What you mean you gon' choke, oh?

Ain't no other chick spending ya dough

When you made me belong

And not see all the things that I kept only just for you?

Closed my mouth more
Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, ""Amen""
And said, ""I mean""
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone and begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know
Are you cheating?
Are you cheating on me?1Embed"

So stroke my big, (eh-eh-eh), ego
I like to joke around a little bit, but here we go
Welcome to the wonderful world of gold-plated Earl, 'cause
Every thing I throw up, blow up
Talking to the girl She said, ""Know what, grow up, you nasty,""
""I don’t understand why they trippin’, if you ask me""
Flow is just the nicest, I emit the propane
I just spit, probably just raised the gas prices
Everybody in the club try and get as fresh as me
What you want, dawg? Tryna stay recession free
And spit, refreshingly when I rock the stadium
You probably get sweaty you should bring a extra tee
Now I’m standing next to Jay who standing next to B
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you’re here with me
That’s good for my ego, me and my ego
And it go wherever we go my ego is my imaginary friend
He was with me when I was only imagining
I had dreams of the league, one day I play Kobe
I walk up to Puff and he already know me
Coulda let the dream killers kill my self esteem
Or use the arrogance as a steam that power my dreams
And my ego

In all the things you say

Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights
When you sit and you think about Father
Or how you tried to be the perfect wife

[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
Then you smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish it didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""

[Chorus]
Until you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

[Verse 2]
Mama (so sexy), you live and learn, that's just the way life goes
(Uh, you a killer, you a killer, killer)
Always know that you've got a daughter
That's so, so proud you took the high road
(You a killer, so sexy)
[Pre-Chorus]
You used to dress and fix your hair
You always smiled through your tears
In the mirror, you would stare
And say a prayer
Like, ""I wish he said I'm beautiful
I wish this didn't hurt at all
I don't know how I got here
I was once the one who had his heart""

[Chorus]
And then you had enough then you took that ring off
You took that ring off
So tired of the lies and trying, fighting, crying
Took that ring off
Oh, now the fun begins
Dust yourself off and you love again
You found a new man now you shine and you're fine
Like it's my time, you took that ring off

[Bridge]
After all your tears
After all that pain's all clear
Mama, after all them years
We can start all over again
Mama, and now it all makes sense
Letting go is never the end
Mama, we can love again
This is where freedom begins
[Outro]
Mama, so put your love on top
You gon' shine and put your love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Everybody, put your love on top
Aye, love on top
Aye, love on top
It's your time to put your love on top
Girl,you so fine, put your love on top

[Outro Skit: Tina Knowles]

You’re bad for me
I clearly get it
I don’t see how something good could come from loving you
The death of me must be your mission
'Cause with every hug and kiss, you’re snatching every bit of strength
That I’m gon' need to fight off the inevitable
And it’s a heart-breakin' situation I’m up in, but I can’t control

[Chorus]
You’re just like poison
Slowly moving through my system
Breaking all of my defenses with time
You’re just like poison and I just don’t get it
How can something so deadly feel so right?
I’m not sure of what to do
It’s a catch 22
'Cause the cure is found in you
I don’t want it, but I do
You’re just like poison
My affliction, I’m addicted, I can't lie
Kiss me one more time before I die

[Verse 2]
You ain't right, take me high
Then that high, it subsides
And my body flat-lines
Then you come to revive
Wait, wait, wait, I’m alive
But how long will it last?
Will it all come crashing down?
How many doses am I needing now?
What’s the prognosis, will you be around?
Or am I just another victim of an assassin that broke my heart down?

It’s my mind
You don’t know how many times I told myself this can't do
And that I don’t need you (no, I don’t need you, no)
It’s so unfair
That I find myself right back in your care
And what’s good is that when you’re not always there
(there, there)
You're no good for my health, my health

Everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet that's my stuff yes
If I bought it nigga please don't touch
And keep talking that mess, that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time
And it's my name that is on that Jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]
Standing in the front yard telling me
How I'm such a fool, talking bout
How I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[Hook: Beyoncé]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I will have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinking
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)
[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
So go ahead and get gone
And call up on that chick and see if she is home
Oops, I bet ya thought that I didn't know
What did you think I was putting you out for?
Cause you was untrue
Rolling her around in the car that I bought you
Baby you dropped them keys hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Hook: Beyoncé]

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah & Beyoncé]
Ayo love you need to calm down over something small
Word, you had to flip, that girl ain't mine
She a custie, word life, she love my shit
I know Kianna told words, she saw us both in the whip
Not mine in the business, ugly self with a flat ass
I know that's your friend, but you first need a man
And regardless to what I do
I'mma stay on my grind, bust my heat and make sure there's food
When we can't stand the rain in the rolex now
And we feeling like a shell jammed up in a barrel
All we gotta do is talk this out
Now you tell me who that man that got hard who set foot in this house
Girl you must not know bout me
That shiny thang in the room gon pluck a tree
And don't make this the reason I ain't touch you in eight days
I thought you was on your friend, thanks, he was leaving you mad late
You pulling out your hair, you scratch my face
Rip my rhyme book's wilding, and you trashed the place
This is unjustifiable
I'mma do these dishes and wash my ass cus I ain't gotta lie to you
Cus I ain't gotta lie to you
You're irreplaceable (Irreplaceable)
[Bridge: Beyoncé]
So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing
Nothing at all to you
Baby I won't shed a tear for you
I won't lose a wink of sleep
Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy

I'm a bitch in the afternoon

I can be really mean towards you
I'm a puzzle, yes, indeed
Ever complex in every way
And all the pieces aren't even in the box
And yet, you see the picture clear as day

I don't know why you love me
And that's why I love you
You catch me when I fall
Accept me flaws and all
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
And that's why I love you

[Verse 2]
I neglect you when I'm working
When I need attention, I tend to nag
I'm a host of imperfection
And you see past all that
I'm a peasant by some standards
But in your eyes, I'm a queen
You see potential in all my flaws
And that's exactly what I mean

I don't know why you love me
