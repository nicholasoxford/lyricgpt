But you ain't fam so what is this ""we"" shit?
You cuff yours and then leash it
Listen, I'm tellin' you, it's my world, I does what I wish to
If you're mad well too bad, sounds like a personal issue
I walk in, they all stare like ""Who the fuck is this dude?""
Kicks game is just rude, don't get jiu-jitsued
Tunnel visions how I get ahead, stayed solid I never fled
My haters feel like I'm better dead
But I'm quite alive getting bread instead
With a better girl, with a better face
I'm in a better place gettin' better head

Signed Gerald, I'm sincere
This year I'm in here, I'll spell it out to make things clear
Meanwhile your end's near, I've got a lane and I'm in gear
You people wonder who's next up
That conversation really ends here
You rappers just talk a bunch, stress me out, I chop a dutch
Weak rappers tryna bite the sound, but my style is a lot to munch
I'm more like whiskey neat, and you're more like vodka punch
G’s dope, he might blow up, think I know, I've got a hunch
On my side it's authentic, you try to stunt but it's all rented
But you're dope you got a bad chick, yeah, cool bro we all get it
She wears a ring, came through without it
You really think she stay true? I doubt it
Cause I'm fucking your girlfriend, and there's nothing you can do about it

'Cause I'm in love with these Tumblr girls
With skinny waists and drug habits
Pretty faces, love status, she acts as if she's the baddest
Man, I swear she's just like tons of girls
She expects the free drinks
And I'm successful, she thinks
Always comes around when weed stinks
We fuck off and on, off and on
Only ever really fuck off and on
Never see her these days 'cause I'm often gone
When I'm home off tour, never stop for long
Back this week from across the pond
Noticed I was close to the block she's on
Elevator to the floor her loft is on
Drinking whiskey, she likes vodka strong
But after we fuck it's over, walked out the door;
That's closure
No, I can't stay here and hold her
Tomorrow act like I don't know her
Wouldn't ever be here sober, can't tell which one is colder
My clothing's on, we both did wrong, I gotta go, that's what I told her, yeah

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
She said she can't feel her face
(She said she can't feel her face)
Yeah, right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings, there's no place
But you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
She's fine as fuck and she knows it
Sexy body, she shows it
Loves the drama, she chose it
She draws the line then she blows it
The most fun, I suppose it
Pops a bottle, won't close it
Feels a fit then she throws it
She pops a bar now she's dozing
She's hot and cold, hot and cold
Homie, I don't know, she's hot and cold
Truly the bullshit has gotten old
Superficial with a rotten soul
Fucking off and on, always stop and go
Probably got someone, choose not to know
Head to her place then we lock the door
Making bad calls when I'm off the blow
'Cause she's a bitch, I'm selfish
Want every girl, can't help it
And it's tough for me to shelf it, it's you I see myself with
Right now I know you felt it
I touched her then she melted
We shouldn't chill but we do it still, gotta play the hand if you dealt it, yeah

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
She said she can't feel her face
(She said she can't feel her face)
Right now I can't feel my heart
For your feelings there's no place
But you knew that from the start
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last

Meant to die, we moved fast and then we crashed
You and I were made of glass, we'd never last
[Outro: Christoph Andersson]
Missing everything you say
It's not important what you stand for
You're asking will he be the one
I'll be gone before you're done tonight
Waiting for another day
You're not getting what you paid for
Trying to salvage what's undone and deny you got outrun tonight
Never knew her name, they're looking all the same to me

I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, I wish we could just pretend to be
Like we always were before as happy as the Kennedys 
No one told Jackie about Marilyn's tendencies 
Ignorance is bliss when you're married half a century
Life is too short, trying to hold it all together
It's gone before you know it but tonight could last forever
I wrote it out on paper but forgot to mail the letter 
And you could walk away but you won't find nothing better 
It's whatever, I just hope that you remember
Then I said some shit that upset her
Arguing in public, talking loud as Big sweater
She said, ""You're always gone."" 
I said, ""'The fuck do you expect from me?"" 
Then she look at me and she said to me

So baby get some sleep tonight

Uh, maybe in some other lifetime
Or somewhere down the road
We might meet up at the right time
Girls come with the profession when you write rhymes 
Clocked me and she told me I'm a pig like I fight crime 
Well, maybe G is just an asshole
Fuck around with bitches Alfalfa, little rascal
I swear my intentions aren't as evil as you think
But temptation's always pushing people to the brink 
Fuck, I always lose my judgment when I drink
My only wish is you would settle down and hear me out
I know I haven't been completely honest and devout
It's difficult for me, these girls try to seek me out 
I try to talk it out but this was all she speak about, she said...

[Hook: Dominique LeJeune]
I, I, I, I, I want to love you 
But if it's not right what can I do?
Everything will be alright 
So baby get some sleep tonight

Uh, so if tonight turns out to be
The last night before you peaced then walked out on me 
Let's let it all hang out like a balcony
One last time, the best is what you about to see 
So make it worth it tonight, only so you know I never hurt you in spite
Love me like you never will again, it's our last time
Tonight forget about the pastime

Contemplatin' just who I coulda turned out to be
If I'da stayed and weren’t heard, what would amount to me?
If I had looked and ain’t found what I have found in me
I mean inside, would they love me? Never looked down on me?
They say, ""You know, if you loved her well then you would have stayed
You could have made a perfect pair that people wouldn't trade""
Trade for nothing, I did though, I had to chase it
Face it, I wasn’t born to live a life basic
They say, ""You turned your back on us just to go and be
An artist, what's a promise anyway when someone breaks it?
I bet he finally gets a shot and then he wastes it
I bet he don’t come back for us when he makes it
And if he do it'd be too late, you gotta face it
'Cause by then there's someone new you been replaced with
Old friends I grew up with, the girl I fell in love with
Love or hate me depending on how you judge it

I had to wander, I had to go tread my own path
If you don't step through no mud, well then it won't last
The years pass, it's crazy how they go fast
Ask myself questions you have, but that you won't ask
Like, ""You don’t even come home enough
Where were you when she was in the hospital, huh? It was only us""
And that’s deep and yeah, I know it cuts
But if that gets you, then you’re weak 'cause we were here and it ain’t broken us
Still as close and stayed by her side when no one was
Like when she lost her job and everything, how broke we was
When she was sick and she needed some taking care of
A fifteen year old shouldered the weight and what he was scared of
The worst, I know that you stayed strong
I don’t say this enough, but you made me just as proud as you made Mom
Yeah, you got some anger, but I don’t blame you at all
I know I don't call, but you're my brother
I love ya

Even if I don't stay

(I promise it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay
(Okay, okay)
[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Yeah, in that first grade class they came and got me
""Your mom's outside, say goodbye now to everybody""
U-Haul was waiting with all of her things, at least what she could pack
In the time my dad's at work and before he came back
Way too young to comprehend what was happenin'
""Are we going to grandma's? When are we coming back again?""
Little did I know that we were leaving him by himself
And ten years would pass before Mom sees anybody else
Just us, in middle school, I ain't understand
Who Melissa was and why she wasn't another man
Biased and confused, they try explain, but nobody can
Wanted what I thought was normal, she had another plan
Such is life, even if it took time for me to accept it
No longer Dad now, but a woman with whom she slept with
Over the years when a secret was how she kept it
I ain't get it, admittedly I was skeptic
I came around, happiness I see's what you may have found
And that's what's most important, I don’t wanna see you breaking down
I wanna see you smile, I don't wanna see you make a frown
If she loves you, then that's all anybody needs maybe now
By '05 things had gotten worse
Moved to the basement, deep depression's a rotten curse
Hidin' in a dark space, her mind and her body hurts
Becomin' more reclusive and the pills should have been alerts
So the worse it got, I became more and more afraid
Until one night, I went into that room, on the floor she laid
I shook her, she was blue, her skin was cold and she wasn't breathin'
Screamed, ""Melissa wake up,"" couldn't fathom that she was leavin'
Mom and Bro was runnin' down, I screamed ""Somebody help""
Try pumping her chest, CPR, but it didn’t help
Toughest pill to swallow, but we lost, that’s forced reflection
While in her life you made her happy, thank you for the blessin'
[Chorus: Kehlani]
Even if I don't stay
(Even if I don't stay)
Everything will be okay
(It’ll be, it'll be okay)
Everything will be okay

[Verse 1]
I've been sitting on the charts like a beach chair
My last album spent 52 weeks there
Almost finished with the second, you should be scared
Storms coming you should go inside and prepare
No shortcuts there ain't no cheats there
I brought the whole city out like a street fair, yeah
And fuck it I'm the coldest white rapper in the game
Since the one with the bleached hair
Yeah, you love it when I talk shit
I get around, yeah I'm on my 2Pac shit
I kinda feel there's no girl I could not get
I'm not found at the function if it's not lit
Yeah, it's nothing that no one can tell me
I made it here dolo, nobody to help me
From the Bay, the birthplace of the hyphy
So bitch, come and say to my face you don't like me

Drinking brown shit now I'm off cup of that
Your girl's on me, what's up with that?
If I like her, all this shit will really take is a double tap
Having visions of fucking an A-list singer, Kardashian, or a Jenner
But Ye's got Kim, Tyga swooped up Kylie
So there's one left watch me go get her
Yeah, they tell me calm down
Fuck that I'm too lit can't calm down
I'm so drunk right now I might fall down
And I don't give a fuck how boring do y'all sound
Up and down on a Wednesday
Then we do the same shit the next day
The next star out the Bay is Eazy

Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(Over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost, Let's get lost

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
What it is, what it could be?
My imagination runs fast
Only if you comin' with me
4 AM staying up past
Or however long these drugs last
Don't know why I live so fast
They be telling me to slow down
I be screaming out ""fuck that!""
I really wanna take you down
Moaning is how I wanna make you sound
Can't wait until I get you home
Fuck that I wanna take you now
Let’s do it all - have a ball
Hook up tonight in the ladies' room stall
Follow you there I'll let you make the call
You can text all your friends say you'll see them tomorrow
That's if you're down
She never fucked the first night until now
Let me, plow
Faded, I'm drunk off the brown
Stayed up all night on the town
Act like tomorrow just doesn't exist
Time isn't real ain't shit on my wrists
Let go of everything then you have bliss
Then she told me this
[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight
Soon I'll be leaving  (I'll be leaving)
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over
(Over)
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
Let's get lost, Let's get lost
[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Let's get lost tonight
You can be supreme Kate Moss tonight
Turn up in the Soho loft tonight
Do drugs, take 10 shots tonight
Awesome I’m naked with Naked and Famous jeans on the floor
Live a wild life, you ain't seen this before
You should give brains and I mean this for sure
That's what genius is for
Beautiful girl that I just met on tour
Another good girl that I'll probably destroy
Her life was stable until she met me
Sheltered and safe so she never gets freed
But she loves trouble she's drawn to the danger
Never goes crazy, I bet I can change her
I could make her fall in love with a stranger
Switch up the pace I don't mean Danny Granger
Can’t wait until tomorrow? I'm fine with today
You pretty as fuck and I'm tryna slay
""Let's do this right now"" is what I'm trying to say
I can tell you don't love him, you're dying to stray
I do not give a fuck 'bout your ex
I'm not looking for love, I'm just looking for sex
Tension between us had me feeling vexed
Then she sent me a text...
[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
Take me down
Take me all the way down tonight, soon I'll be leaving
Break me down
Break me all the way down, before the night is over

Let's get lost, Let's get lost

That's that endless summer, never going back to school
We do what we wanna, can't tell me no rules
Every night on the town, going out all the time
And I'm tryna take you down, only thing on my mind

Uh, this shit is not random
Everybody ain't got it, understand son
Yeah, this shit is not random

Woah, okay
It's my world and I do what I like to
I know she gon' be ready when I slide through
If you forgot I got it, I'll remind you (remind you)
'Cause I got what they got, I'm talkin' times two
Disagree with me and you've been lied to
I am nothing like you, and no I'm not the type to
Follow bullshit y'all give the hype to
I can see the fakes, so when I look in your direction
Understand I'm seein' right through
You're hollow, you follow?
Everybody's not the real McCoy
Worldwide, yeah, they feel the boy
California out to Georgia, Florida, then up to Illinois
When I listen to your music, I just feel annoyed
Haters, I don't understand 'em
Bred Jordan ones from 2001 (OG)
Today I think I want a Phantom
If I don't get it I'ma throw a fuckin' tantrum, whoa!

Everybody ain't got it, understand son (sorry)
Yeah, this shit is not random

[Verse 2]
Now imagine it, put the hours in and stayed passionate
Wasn't blowin' money, I was stackin' it
Figured what the fuck I want to do in life and practiced it
Pay attention, none of this is happenin' by accident
Listen, I don't slack a bit
Game plan's solid, no cracks in it
Said I want a billion now, nothing less is adequate
Grab a check, cashin' it
I was born addicted to the money
Difference now I finally found a way to manage it
What you think I'm paid for, nothin'?
You must be mistakin' someone
I had to go make that fundin'
I'm tryna be great at somethin'
Spend, not saving nothin'
Flyin' from the Bay to London
They say money talks but you ain't saying nothin', shh
Now try and shade me, I'm like, ""I guess""
Why yes, you drive a Toyota, please define flex
Sign CDs and I sign breasts
Understand, to these female fans, I'm sex

Got this flight to London, I ain't pop no Xans for it
In case you was wonderin', I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A., barely caught the plane
Fuckin' TSA, swear a nigga ran for it
Ain't used to this fame shit
This you-all-know-my-name-shit

That fucked around and made it
Fucked over my main chick
Damn, she was the main chick
Thinkin' 'bout the game
I shouldn't have played, but I played it

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, ooh, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you (ooh)
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart (woah)
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
(Now, I mean, yeah)
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, ""Who is this?""
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now

Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
(You tell me, uh, yeah)
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'till I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now

Ever seen a devil with a halo?
Ever seen an angel with some horns?
Everybody got their own demons
Everybody fightin' their own war, oh

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
When you move this fast as I'm movin'
All the toxic things that I'm using
All the substances I'm abusin'
All the sex, and the drugs, and the boozin'
The decision is mine for the choosin'
But I can't understand what I'm losin'
'Cause I been this way, it's not a new thing
I know a Gemini can be confusing
Split right down the middle like there's two of me
No hiding, I bare all nudity
This is everything that comes with celebrity
Criticism, ridicule and the scrutiny
Think about what I spent on some jewelry
But it all comes back to me usually
And it's none of y'alls business truthfully
You don't know 'bout the fame, what it do to me
I'm talking to myself like every night
You could try to be a better guy
But to understand a Gemini
Angel, Devil, it's both him and I
Demons in me, they just multiply
If I don't kill 'em all, I never try
Life is short, and men lie, women lie
But a legend, he could never die
[Chorus: Zoe Nash & G-Eazy]
Ever seen a devil with a halo? (y'know, uh)
Ever seen an angel with some horns? (y'know)

Everybody fightin' their own war (uh)

I miss you only sometimes, I give you real tough love
'Cause I'm a devil with a halo
Woah, oh-oh (Yeah)
Oh-oh

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Put the hours in, put the work in
Swear I try so hard to be perfect
But sometimes, shit feels like a burden
'Cause I still ain't shit but a person
Switch lanes in the Porsche that I'm swervin'
Tell myself slow down off the bourbon
""When you drive like that, it made me nervous""
Not tonight, not closing the curtains
When I die, not trying to see hell
Feel like I'm headed that way in a V12
And I just broke up with my female
On tour, had to do it by email
But that's all, I'ma save you the detail
Therapy with a beat and a freestyle
Either way, live today, I'ma be well
'Cause I never wanna let 'em see me fail
I'm talkin' to myself, ""What's wrong with you?
You should make some songs to turn up to
Thinkin' too much like you usually do
'Til you drink some liquor, then you're cool
Throw your brain away, that's all it takes
Dumb it down, but that's not what he makes
Then say fuck the sales and fuck the biz'
It's not that easy Gerald, nothing is""

Yeah, rappers try to brag about accomplishments
But nothing you've been dropping yet astonishes
Yeah, next shit I'm about to say is obvious
But criticism's worth some more than compliments
Yeah, we're living at a different speed
Trying to sprout a money tree, we started out with just a seed
Always working, never hindered by a little fatigue
Rapping in arenas, I'm still playing in a different league
Yeah, you still playing wiffle ball
Dropping opportunities I'm picking up a different call
Holding out for bigger checks to lift us all
Never kept a safety net to catch us even if I fall
Rather risk it all than play it safe
You like to sprinkle salt and player hate
My team can eat, I'll share a plate
I had the black on black, I swear you're late

[Chorus]
Everyday I got some fly shit on
Keeping all black outfit on
I already bagged most the chicks
That you out here trying to get on
You just catching up to what I've been on

Thinking quick and making plans, y'all be thinking sort of slow
You be thinking more bitches, I be thinking more dough
Showed them all I do this shit but trust me, I got more to show
Yeah, yeah, I'm just getting started now
All that swerve and spill my Bourbon, brody, that's a party foul
Rappers try to swear they're cool, really? I'm like ""hardly, pal""
Black on black with hair slicked back, boy, I got the hardest style
And I'm always snatching chicks
Flier than Aladdin's whips
Haters on the sideline bitter, hella fucking mad he's rich
Took your darling off your arm, now she just wanna be daddy's bitch
They can't even find me where I'm chillin' like my addy switched
Yeah, breaking rules, we all bent 'em
Dreaming about these M's, told my team ""let's all get 'em""
Make a classic song, last as long as raw denim

If he sayin' he respect me, then it's likewise
Another man safe from another drive-by
I like the way she shake that cake, it's like a race
If she bad, I might take her out, not on a date
Say she boujee, she hit my phone, 'cause her nigga late
A 100K just off two shows spent that in a day

Uh, and everyone's like “No, no G why'd you rap on that shit?
And make a dumb song about acting ratchet
Flip another 50's song, that’s a classic
Endless Summer, please go back to that shit""
Ain’t shit changed, got the facts to back it
Uh huh, and I don’t give a fuck if the truth be told
‘Cause I been doing drugs with these groupie hoes
Drunk listening to Gucci throwed
Last night, yeah, I found a slut
Who appeared to be the type to be down to cut
She took another shot and said “turn down for what?”
Like “I don’t know, fuck, you look like you might throw up”
Silly hoes party so much these days
The Monica Lewinsky’s who give the BJ’s
I really like your friend, call her up for three ways
This songs full of all the clichés
Bulleit Bourbon, I pull up swervin’
I’m the waviest, I might pull up surfing
I’m waking up, I’m hungover as fuck
I make the girl get out, but first pull the curtain
Off a thizzle throw a party, all these bitches sniffle
Neighbors bugging saying ‘‘please just try to keep it civil!’’

We brought weed, we brought bars
Said “bring friends”, she was cool with that
The homie brought the whip, I hopped in front, there’s two in back
Artsy girls, they just want to go to school and act
She gon’ run and tell her friends that Skizzy Mars is cool as shit
Rapper stereotypes, but what if it happens like every night?
I pull out my phone and I barely can type
Mix the liquor, the pills and it rarely goes right, I’m like
Look where we started, we used to get carded
Two-stepping models at 1 Oak and Darby
Blues by the curtain, the life of the party
She a big fan, got my mixtape on her laptop
Cigarettes and Henn, the city is our backdrop
Her and all her friends, Instagramming, taking Snapshots

Signed a thousand titties, I'm talkin' millions of bitties
I'm a dog, I chase that kitty, if your girlfriend is pretty
Chances are I'm tryin' to snatch so I could slay and take her with me
Bro I'm the man, did you not know that?
Your girl want me to take a picture with her on her Kodak
And you're so whack, she knows that
I be where the coke and smoke at
See her friend and now I'm going for that three like I'm Steve Novak
Don't be mad at me if she leaves
You should always know not to fuck around with thieves
She just wants to kick it with some g's
Smoke some trees, pop some p's, later she'll be on her knees
And I'm gone

Be worried if I show up on her phone
You don't want to leave the two of us alone
Cause I'mma probably take her somewhere soon to bone

Many look at me like I ain't even got a fuckin' plan (fuckin plan)
Alright, that's cause I'm the fuckin' man
Yo girl on some Romeo and Juliet
Cause she would rather kill herself than ever be with you again
So I swoop in and tell her, if her parents don't approve of me
That don't change a goddamn thing, girl, I don't buy no jewelry
Never spendin' money on a necklace
Or a bracelet, let's just face it, like you better when I'm wasted
And you like me when I'm silent, silent but I'm deadly
Me and G some lady killers, let me start the medley like, hello (Hi there)
And please don't put your number in my phone (Don't do that)

[Verse]
These girls wanna tie a kid down and keep me around
But I would never change; I’m a dog, I’m a hound
But I tell them what they wanna hear
They like how it sounds
Till I’m gone with the wind and I’m lost, never found
I met her at my show, then we smashed right after
If we go three rounds then she'll fall in love faster
The very next morning I’m Casper
In another city for a show somewhere getting plastered
It’s a disaster; to her I’m a drug
I do her kinda dirt, but they still fall in love
And I don’t understand it, foreign chicks on me
And she speak another language like she from another planet
She struggle when I’m gone, It’s hard when I leave
Being Ricky Pen, wear my heart on my sleeve
And she tell me that she love me but it’s hard to believe
Cause I’m coming and going, then I cum then I leave
And I swear I’m really not that shady
But you can’t blame me for who I’ve met lately
Nowadays chicks wanna call a kid baby
As soon as they find out I rap, shit's crazy
But I do play along, yo I can’t front
I give in to every groupie with a fat butt
London to Japan, Hong Kong to Iran
Chicks say I’m the man

Uh, yeah, I might regret this when tomorrow comes
But, them drunk nights are more fun than sober ones
With every shot, they're like ""Aw, here Kobe comes!""
But I got this bad bitch tryna to throw me buns
If I listened to my Uncs, all them older ones
They all talk about karma, how it slowly comes (uh)
But, life is short, enjoy it while you're young
Spend my bank account tonight and have to borrow funds
It all started with a light glass
Now I'm asking ""How long could tonight last?""
Man, she had an eeh face with a tight ass
If I had a shot less, then I might pass
But, I'm faded and I got a little sedated
I can't believe we made it, every night we celebrate it
I live like Jim Morrison, no telling where I'll take it
I take her to my room and I tell her ""Get naked""

Stayed over, now she's about to get attached again
Walls built up around, they come crashing in
Passed out at 6 A.M., but she's up at 10
Doing this was not in my plans
She got up and saw rubbers in the trash can
Hoop earrings, some bitch left on my nightstand
Cussed me out and stormed off like ""Alright then"" (uh)
On both sides, that was bad for 'em
Why do people do things that be bad for 'em?
Say we done with these things, then we ask for 'em
When the sun comes down, then we transform
Yeah, you can probably bet this
By this time tomorrow, I'll probably regret this
Try, but it all falls down like Tetris

Hyphy on one, off a bottle might be, my tree
Smokin' Agent Orange, Hi-C
Back when me and Marty was recordin' at my Mom's
Most of y'all were chasin' around bops
I was in the lab, only hoping that my job
Never would be based around mops now I'm on
Yeah, she know; love me cause my ego
Girls and the drugs always follow us where we go
Ay, where the Bay at?
Shouts out to Jay Ant
Lookin' for the party girls, let me know where they at
Skinny rich girls always askin' where the yay at
Throw a house party like cool, where you stay at?
Turn upside down, let her twerk on the wall
Took her to the bathroom and did work in the stall

It ain't funny what I've been through
Your enemy can be some kin to you
I started off hella broke
Hung around people that's older than me, took notes
Momma worked three jobs on the weekends
Used to help her wash the walls at Mare island
In Vallejo naval houses
Havin' a roof over my head was my allowance
The oldest of four, young adults
Surrounded by grief, big dreams and hope
They hated and they doubted
How did you take it? Took it with a grain of salt
I wanted it badly, they couldn't stop me, Indie
Erry label wanted to sign me
Grew up on Short and Freddie B
(Who else?) Magic Mike and Calvin T

I said “yeah, I want that I'm certain”
And this bus pass I’ve got, yeah this shit’s just not working
The world sees me one way
I look in the mirror, see a whole other person
Fuck normal, if you don’t agree, I ignore you
I’m blowing this money, fuck being resourceful
I’m there for more and of course I’ll go get it
I did it, I feel like I walked through a portal
I'm here, I'm winning, bitch look at the scoreboard
I score more, I tour more, think twice
Are you sure you're more popping?
Popping champagne and I pour more
I get what I want and then I, I just want more, more

Last night I sent a message
Drunk when I sent it, pieces of a fragmented sentence
Essentially along the lines of saying I'm in town
And crossed the line, just saying if you're down
Let's chill and get a drink
I sipped, hopin' I would hear again
The text bubble popped up and disappeared again
Like I don't want it gettin' weird again
And I don't wanna fight
And I don't want you shedding tears again
It's not a big deal, but don't think I don't think about you
Just 'cause I ain't spoken about you
I'd asked how you feel, but already know I won't get it out you
You'll probably tell your friends that I wrote this about you
Whatever, I know I can be jealous and crazy
The voices in my head have liked to yell at me lately
I still can't believe what they've been telling me lately
Sometimes I wonder if you share my sentiments, maybe
Let me know

Backdoor to Oracle, fuck it, I'm home (Woo)

Somehow I fit six all in one Benz (One Benz)
All of us fuck buddies, all fuck friends
Lookin' like a snack, she'll devour me (Ayy)

Winning somewhere, somewhere else you just lost something though
The cost of opportunities is always good to know
But if you know that then you're good to go
Yea, no dreams too big
Chase anything you have the passion to do
Only a dream 'till it happens to you
Finally seeing money now I'm acting a fool
Never thought touring the world all year would be something I might actually do
Friends came through got me so high
I forgot who I was passin' it to
Party in a mansion splash in a pool
Reminiscing '06 back in the school
When my whole crew would come through and rap with us too
Couple of them been goons, packin in a tool
Go ahead try and talk shit on me
I squad up come back with a crew
Call me a bitch see what that's gonna do
Fights in the streets like that shit was cool
Yea, We used to do dumb shit daily
Dreamed since I was just a baby
Now I'm here its ""Fuck you, pay me""
I just had enough of waiting
I worked hard, they stuck with lazy
If I stayed I'd have just went crazy
People change
Everything's in constant motion
My old girl's across the ocean
Some stuff fades thats lost devotion
Some folks stay some come and go
Ain't what you think it's what you know
I must run fast you're running slow
Smoke, break down some kush and roll a dutch
Right now my vibe's so alive so please
When we smoke just hush
Me and some of those who's closest to me haven't spoken much
Crazy when you learn the cost of blowing up
Yea
I know I should keep in better touch
But that door it never shuts
Even when we chilled I never said that much
Sometimes it be worth the bullshit sometimes you should let it flush
Yea, but when I'm on tour now I just get a rush
Everything is hella plush
Get caught up in all the girls I get and stuff
Meanwhile I see some girls I used to know are getting wed and stuff
Having kids with full salary jobs while I'm just getting drunk
Missing every birthday anniversary
Yesterday my moms got out of surgery
Wasn't even in town
Shows and after parties what I've been 'round
Finding out the news late
Imagine how that shit sound
Sit down priorities are all over the place and shit
Stress levels rise and that J gets lit
Try on shoes that Jay Z fit
Fuck all that complacent shit
I'm just dropping crazy shit
Trying to outdo those fool who think they can spit
But I can't even lie
All this real life shit is passing me by
Talking to myself and I'm asking me why
Would I feel better as an average guy?
But I know that's just a lie
Pour up a glass and get high
Wonder if this rockstar life taking a toll on me like I'm asking to die
Going on tour for 6 months, hug moms right after she sigh
Look up wish me luck when you see that plane pass in the sky
No Stress bullshit gets passed to the side
Working hard to make sure I'mma be the man when I die
Yea

Hey Gerald I just wanted to leave a message

You have risen to the peaks of A. behavior
And creativity, and its just the beginning Gerald and it's going to be your life by the sounds of it, and I'm just so proud
I just wanted to call and sound like my cheery self when I'm happy

Wood floors in your Soho apartment
Every morning always roll one and spark it
Credit cards left on your glass table
You been wildin' since I met you last April
A beautiful, outgoing, alcoholic, socialite
Like the way I talk to you, I was so polite
Always claimin' that you're not the type to notice hype
But that's the reason why we kicked it and you know it's right
I was your Bob Dylan, you were my Edie Sedgwick
But where I used to see beauty, now I just see pathetic
It was fun while it lasted but you'll never get it
You're living in your own world, where love is all synthetic
Yeah, and now you walk around woefully
For a minute thought about forever like it's Jodeci
But now you're spiraling and falling over hopelessly
And I just wonder if you notice me, yeah

And you're just spending your allowance cash
On some shopping sprees, drinks, and a powder stash
But it drains like the sand in an hour glass
And when it does is when I see you turnin' sour fast
Free falling from the sky 'till the gravel caught us
Spending cash, burning holes in her fragile pockets
Doin' drugs on the surface of Apple products
Started beautiful but look at where havoc brought us
And it was fun but I could never be the one for you
You're never happy, always looking 'round for something new
But it was unbelievable when I was fucking you
Thought that I was momentarily in love with you
Nah, see you're in love with material
And even more in love with attention
Walking through life so eager for affection
And never really was a connection, nah

4AM is when she leaves clubs
She's...
[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
In love with fashion, still trying to be Audrey Hepburn
Grabs the check, but she spends what she hasn't yet earned
Life's a bitch, if you play with fire you get burned
The road to riches could throw you off at the next turn
Yeah, poor little rich girl
Cries her eyes out, it's all part of the show
Fell in love with the fast life but started it slow
Loves creative types, slept with every artist she know
Comes from high society, but they frown on her actions
Instagrams half naked, how she sounds in her captions
Always snobby and conceited, she knows what the deal is
Wants to party, thumbs through a rolodex full of dealers
Yeah, cause she said the high was divine
The first time is what she kept on searching trying to find
Scared to lose it all but everything was nothing inside
Couldn't face the truth but everyone's got something to hide
It's ironic how conscious she is of how she appear
Two hours getting dressed but still can't look herself in the mirror
Making poor choices, even at her wealthiest year
Was a fast lifestyle that no one helped her to steer, yeah

Hand on my heart, allegiance to the night
Every star waits for the darkness to shine
Why do I cry when the tears never dry
Why do I drown when I look through your eyes
Love is the morning that succeeds the night
I was gone by the first sign of the light

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
When it's dark out
I search for love but don't find it
Just sex n drugs but don't mind it
Because nothing's real I'm reminded
And
I Do suppose
Ignorance is bliss truth be told
They say go smash these groupie hoes
N Spend money on some newer clothes
N put poison up through your nose
Well
Eventually everything fades
Even the brightest of Colors turn greys
Highs comes down But the pain still stays
Even the longest of nights turn days
Then
Wake up and it's over
Love to escape cuz I hate being sober
& you and I we never had closure
We just knew when it was over

But the star comes alive in the darkness
Late nights Lower east side apartments
But the night is impossible to Harness
Soon as comes it Departs us
Couldn't stay & love you so I became Heartless
Lost track of our long term targets
Live n Die young leave a beautiful carcass
Thinkin when we just had met
Realizing now that it just wasn't meant
But how would we know If the time wasn't spent?
If only we could live where the sun doesn't set
Somewhere it's always light out and happy
You and I were like a Sid vicious and Nancy
I mean it was bound to be tragic its
No way this ever coulda lasted

All in the club, go commando
She a trap girl, met her ass at the bando
Pouring up more than she can handle
Ones on the booty, man, R.I.P Nando, damn
Let the lil bitch take that like Diddy
You know what it is, everytime I'm in the city
Slums in this bitch, let the shit get gritty
Whole lotta ass, plus the face real pretty
Okay, but look at the shit that I'm on
Bought a new whip, bought a new home
Bought her new lips, that for the dome
Bought a new bitch, I can't go wrong
Ho at the six, leave me alone
G it's too easy, I'm growing like phones
She gave me the pussy, boy, off of this song
[Hook: P-Lo]
When she see me, she wanna take a flick
Come to my house, then I make her strip
I'm a player, you on the bench
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might, I might just fuck your bitch
I said I might

[Verse 3: P-Lo]
Damn, I done took your beezy
Everytime I'm gone, she say that she need me
She ain't get no call, she know I got reasons
They ain't really balling, you know that they reaching
I'm thuggin' with my bros, I bet she make it grow
Don't got love for these hoes, lil stunner
She want it in her, raw, you know Imma tell her naw
I put it in her jaw, lil stunner
Took your bitch after the club, she wanna fuck, aye, aye, aye
She in a rush, maybe she think she in love, aye, aye, aye
I just took your bitch and I ain't even try
All I say is real and I can't even lie

[Hook: P-Lo]
When she see me, she wanna take a flick
Come to my house, then I make her strip

[Intro: Dion]
Here's my story, it's sad but true
It's about a girl that I once knew
She took my love, then ran around
With every single guy in town
[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Um, so I said ""Peace!,"" and I left it
Can't get mad at me when your actions request it
Couldn't even tell me to my face, had to text it
You can pack your bags, follow signs to the exit
Yes, move it along please, pronto
Oh, and by the way, return your keys to the condo
If you played at the Apollo
You'd be the type of act that I would boo off stage
While I throw you a tomato
A tough act to follow, but you fooled me, bravo
Can't believe I fell for your bull, Chicago
Can't believe you asked me to stay, nah, hoe
I'm outta here with rocket power, babe, Otto
[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins
Heartbreak hotel room, 505
I was blinded by love, and the way she lied
Not me, no way, but that day she fooled me
When I caught Sue running around
She was running around, she was running around, she was running around
She was, she was running around

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Well, I should've known she would run around
Chill for a second, then peace when the Summer's down
Now, how dumb I sound, ever since I fell for the apple of my eye?
Cupid always keeps his gun around
When I smash, she was like a woman from the past
A Mary Tyler Moore with more ass
Should've figured something when she let me score fast
But I was misguided, thinking she had more class
Nah, I couldn't be wronger
Fuck it anyways, it was time to move onward
I'm tripping no longer
Put her on the streets like a Banksy
'Cause I was too swanky, and she was too skanky

[Hook: Greg Banks]
She played with my heart, made me question, if I was insane
Sue's the prettiest girl in town but she's venom to your veins

When I caught Sue running around

And fuck whoever thought it wasn't that hard
$1,500 dollar limit dreaming about a black card
Aiming for the stars, with a rocket in the back yard
Hard to keep a good girl, not trying to play that card
But never had no cash to spend
Need a whip? I ask a friend
If I can't we'll stay in, even sweats you look attractive in
Cook a meal at home, some yellow tail I pour a glass, pretend
Smash all night then wake you up to smash again
Felt like we could never do wrong, and you been down for too long
There's nothing to improve on, that's why I could never move on
From clippin' out a coupon, from sleeping on a futon
To being driven in a presidential Lincoln or a Yukon
And I know you always stay down for the cause
You love me even for the flaws
But don't do this shit for applause
Soon as I get right then I'mma take care of you
Swear I'm so prepared to love you
Know it's no one there above you

[Hook]
My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one
I’m so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love, with you I have no sight
[Verse 2]
Yeah, pick it up where I left you at
Never want to go have to go get you back
Enough hard times, yeah we went through that
Big ol' house, I'mma get you that
Overseas trips, baby let's do that
Lookin' at your face and I'm thinking' about the place where I met you at
Yeah, and since day one, you supported these dreams
Always stayed right by my side
Trust, I notice these things
Even way, way back
When my buzz was dead like bee stings
Broke as ever, when your vision's far it's tough to see things
And whenever we ate out, we might split an entree
Bank account with $3k, that's no relation to Andre
And that would be a hot day save for rain, that's what my moms say
I think just putting cash away is what she was trying to convey
Cause money comes, money goes; People switch to funny roles
Anyone would tell you that one good girl's worth twenty ho's
Soon as I get right I'mma take care of you
Swear I'm so prepared to love you
Know it's no one there above you

My whole life has changed
Since you came in, I knew back then

Dear Gerald, you're fourteen years and a truant
You're trying to find your place, and figure out where you fit
You're finna start rappin' with a kid you went to school with
But, more on that later, right now you're going through it
See, you're going to have to prove that you ain't soft and you ain't stupid
And you gon' have to scrap with some kids that you ain't cool with
You got a short temper, just be careful when you lose it
You wanna be the man, but it's gon' take some time to prove it
You'll fall in love, but she's gon' break your heart and put you through it
Fuck falling for that bullshit, you gon' fall in love with music
You're finna get arrested, almost fuck around and lose it
Spend days in juvy standing at the window, looking through it
Nothing in life is promised, not even free-time is
So, only chase dreams, and only chase commas
Won't happen on its own, trust, trust, we've been through it

I mean, I was fucking up
I was seventeen, I was eighteen, just doing dumb shit
My moms made me move to New Orleans and shit, I went to school down there on a scholarship
I finally got my shit together, I started taking music seriously
Then it started to kinda pop off a little bit, almost

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Dear Gerald, 21, you think you've got it figured out
Got a big head from them labels trying to bring you out
'Til they passed on you, they ain't see what they was missing out
On, that flight home gave you some shit to think about
Scrambling trying to figure out, went back to the drawing board
Know they say rejection's only supposed to make you want it more
But, no lie, you contemplating quitting, walking out the door
But, what the fuck you supposed to do? This is all you're living for
Really it was that and Dev, that was all you had
Paying rent by engineering other rappers at the pad
Barely getting by, hella broke, you was doing bad
Then ""These Things Happened"", you finally seen a bag
You drove down the highway, a fork in the road
A normal life with her, or going for broke?
I seen an open lane and then I drove straight through it

[Spoken: G-Eazy]
I literally sold all my shit
I moved out of my place in New Orleans
I was bouncing around, living out of a suitcase
Crashing on friends' couches
Living at AirBnb's and hotels
Trying to make the album
Trying to make When It's Dark Out
If I could take it there, that'd be great

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
Dear Gerald, life changed since you dropped your second album
And Me, Myself & I just went 7x Platinum
Toured around the world, damn, you really had 'em
But now you're 27 and it's time to be a legend
Back when it all started, grinding hard on that promo tour
Tired from the night before and the night before and the night before
Fuck it, tomorrow, gotta fly some more
Don't complain, this is what you signed up for
You're working for your family, managers, agents
They all want something different from you, tell them all patience
But, this one's on you, the lonely quest of greatness
Been trying to be famous, been trying to be A-list
When you arrive, it will appear as if there's nothing to it
But, you planted the seeds and you grew it
There's people taking credit for success that they had nothing to do with

If it was easy, everyone would do it

So now you're here
What you gon' do with it?
You know?

[Verse 4: G-Eazy]
Make no mistake, listen it's the life that I was chosen for
All I prayed for was an open door
I've been rich, I've been broke before
I've seen the floor
You try to put me in a box, I'll box out like Okafor
And fuck being indecisive now I'm so for sure
And fuck Trump, it's like ""What the fuck we voted for?""
And most of y'all should probably party less and focus more
And if that line resonates, you're probably who I wrote it for
Where will I go from here? ""IDK""
They want me to architect Rome, in a day
Juice knew I was greatness when he looked at me
Right away, I've made platinum records that'll never see the light of day
This is what the whole world's been waiting for
The crowd's jumping, going dumb till they break the floor
Come take a walk inside my mind, come and take a tour
I'm really not playing, what the fuck you take me for?

Gerald what the fuck is wrong, man?
Cheer the fuck up, you asshole, yeah
[Verse 1]
We fake it 'til we make it, work while everyone doubts
I was dreamin' of award shows while still on the couch
Fame is all so new to me, guess I'm feelin' it out
Man the other day my grandma said she's selling the house—wait
See I was much more bummy and less star
When my mom's unemployment check wouldn't stretch far
Wishin' that my confidence was made out of Kevlar
And I could superhero, save the day, cop her next car
Coming out the Bay feels like nobody gets far
Feels like we're doomed
Like they're building a Death Star
Drink it all the way, stumble into the next bar
Rap is like the lottery, we're all tryna scratch for
But when that shit just strikes gold
You accomplish life goals
Go and get that ice froze, get paid off of nice flows
It's weird now I got money to buy nice steez
But don't look down
Get scared of heights like these
[Hook]
Gerald what you so sad for?
Why the hell you got the blues?
Everybody wanna be in your shoes
Gerald what you so sad for?
Everything ain't that bad
Name a reason that you got to be mad
Gerald what you so sad for?
Man stop acting like a bitch
Forgot you're all famous now and rich?
Gerald what you so sad for?
Man stop cryin', homie rap more
(Alright, well)
[Verse 2]
And in a year I went from overlooked to over-booked
You won't ever understand the work it took
Drinkin' every night to celebrate what we made
But the parties have changed
Weirdos crowd around and start acting strange
At the bar stress chain smoking cigarettes
And I don't even smoke, I know I should drink a little less
But nothing can prepare you for how crazy this business gets
Once again sad boy Gerald is in distress
So hard on myself I think I'm going insane
The mind of a perfectionist is always in pain
Should be happy I don't have to set alarms to wake up
I just tour and cake up
I should probably call home so me and moms can make up
These days the only home I know is the road
And clowns are all sad inside, or so I’m told
And the girl I'm really thinking of is states away
We'll run away and find a place to stay

Never going back to no basic shit
When we on tour every night's wild
Thinking about the days we weren't making shit
Spending everything just to make it back
Saying everything never take it back
So if you don't fuck with me I'm okay with that
I'm okay with that (okay with that)
In a black shirt and some faded jeans
Been around the world in these APC's
Working non stop trying to take the keys
Off the lot next week spending 80 g's
Intro my floor to your lady's knees
Always on tour cause I'm making cheese
Michigan in February is 8 degrees
And the fans waiting outside could maybe freeze
Yeah, smoking on killa
Never going on unless your team is strong
Yeah, finally making skrilla
Everywhere I go bring my team along

Like I'm tryna drown in this whiskey
Indulge in everything we wish
We drink it straight with no mixers
Got bitch drinks if you squeamish
At the after parties, no pictures
My bag of trees looks greenish
Got a bad bitch to roll swishers

We never got along
Just think about me when you play this song

You'll be so regretful
And revenge is sweet
I get full quickly, then I just forget you
But I can't even tell a lie
Felt like you were special
Till I realized what's up and left
Got you feeling dreadful
So whether not you meant to
Ain't no difference between it
Cause everything we had is gone now you can't redeem it
Can't tell if you're oblivious or if you really mean it
I wonder just how many other folks before me seen it
But that shit love can make you blind to a lot of shit
But I can't waste my time on this right now I gotta split

And then you did some shit I never would have thought

Yea, Catching shots from head to toe
I don't need no medic though
A modern Gatsby chasing Daisy I should have let it go
But you never know
I might have dreamed too high, rather way too low
Cause you wouldn't stick around back when I wasn't making dough
Till you see a poster with my face for me to play a show
And your friends are like ""He made it now! Fucking way to go""
Used to dream about becoming rich
You ain't see the vision
I ain't make it fast enough for you so you ain't stickin' with him
I used to think about a life with you and music I was wishin'
For them both but you ain't see it 'till I brought one to fruition
But for some reason now and then I still consider
The what if's and the maybes but that shit just makes me bitter

Your shots just graze me, I'm standing, ain't put a hole in me
I answer to no one, nobody can get control of me
MGK please stop trolling me, get over me
You wanna be me, you're mad that you're not as big as me
I'm everywhere, I'm your nightmare, you can't get rid of me
Call a Uber, turn on the radio, mad you're hearing me
""Him & I's"" on, mad you're listening to Halsey sing to me
Can't fuck with nobody with so much negative energy
A pillar in this game bruh, I'll be here until infinity
Ask myself why am I entertaining a mini-me?
You're so below my class, you're reaching, you're not offending me
I headline arenas, and all of my shits go platinum
You never seen a plaque and your last shit did thirty thousand
It's not a competition, I'd hurt you if I start braggin'
Irrelevant in culture, no one gives a fuck about him
You got both of my numbers, all this time, you never called the boy
I'm headlining, heard you opening up for Fall Out Boy
Don't play with my name, you fucker, I said it's not a toy
Disrespect her again, I'll smack you, I'm not a boy
Opened up my savage, usually I don't do this shit
I don't got too much time, let's be honest, and let's get to this shit
Your last joint was six years ago
It's a miracle that Flex found you worth it enough to even hear you flow
But I guess you both might have something in common, though
You got your spot tooken from you, you're mad about it so
Yeah, that’s why it might sting, but I'm the fucking hive
Breakfast Club at 105, it's keeping New York's shit alive
We did like 30 shows together out in Europe
You mugged me, but you never spoke, you never tried to square up
Until that night in Finland, I said we got shit to clear up (I'm sorrry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry)
You got sentimental and you almost start to tear up
You told me how you fucked with me, and you ain't have no problems
I said it's all love, whatever happened we forgot it (Fuckin' punk)
And then you flip-floppin' all year, talkin' 'bout me
You talked behind my back, this whole time you never called me (Be a man, motherfucker)
So why you actin' extra tough? Keep it lit, it’s just a bluff
Why's it me and not you that's sittin' ringside next to Puff?
I ain't want to bring this up, but respect to the OG
But don't ever cross the line again, fuck, you don't know me
Honestly, what's up with you? This behavior is nothing new
Jealous, actin' petty, guess I make you uncomfortable
Bad Boy treats you like a family you're adopted to
You're signed to him, tell me why doesn't Puff fuck with you
Numbers don't lie, I don't either, hear your bullshit through the speaker
You are such a fucking joke, I ain't want to do this ether
You must hate yourself, I don't understand your issue
Ironic this what's happening the night that Eminem dissed you
Fuck you, bitch28Embed"

[Intro]
Yeah, shout out Big Juice and that champagne he's drinking
You know, yeah uh

[Verse 1]
Circle's always small, keep a certain few
Only ever us, just the perfect crew
People ask for help, ""can we work with you?""
Got me on the verge of rude
If I may ask you kindly, please fuck off, I got work to do
Moving on, every day improving on
Came a long ways, they're like damn G you're stupid on
Something must be in the water, let us know what you be on
Studying my moves and they follow every groove we on
Bad idea to go bad on us
Hop off the bus and get left in a path of dust
Imagine us, if I don't help 'em, they get mad and fuss
Then they turn bitch and talk shit and start acting sus
Chips are down in my hands a flush
So I flip them off while I grab my nuts
You ain't catching us
Improper grammar, sorry, grandma, but I had to cuss
Fuck 'em, now I see why these fuckboys mad at us
[Hook]
Heard they was talking sideways
Uh, oh word that's what they say?
Uh, I would say it's sad to see you go
But I never gave a fuck about you anyway
Oh well
Lately I've been living so swell
Uh, if you ain't fucking with us, oh well
Phony homies always tryna ride the coattail
Uh, and don't I know it so well
Oh well, hahaha
Oh well, yeah

[Verse 2]
New deal's working out, it's how my money stays in shape
Always draped, in some A.P.C. or bathing ape
Life changed, on the day Tez played the tape
I reflect on the journey as I chill and hit the Vape
Now I'm here bitch, need a 'Rari not a Subaru
Only coming through the party if I get my crew in too
Twenty deep, no I.Ds, moving through, leave, there's no room for you
Every time you take the stage they boo at you
Uh, moving mean gas never losing steam
Rap game DiCaprio I should be on the movie screen
But the lab's where I'm usually seen
Pussy boys throwing sneak shots, I'm like, who you mean? Huh?
No shades of gray here, my wardrobe is jet-black
Fuckboys beware here, that's your cue to get back
Regardless of setbacks, I do what I'm best at
That's spit facts, bless tracks and fuck hoes and get stacks

Maybe the fact I got a flight at six
Adds to the mystique of what might exist
Lurked your Instagram tryna like your pics
I know your boyfriend, he probably might get pissed
It's one o'clock, I've drunk all of this
So that's probably why I'm all acting brash
I'm like an addict how I have to smash
I'm always leaving fast, she think I am The Flash
Cause she's never catching a man
If it don't pan out I'm a flash in a pan
Young Leonardo, try catch if you can
We just spent the night now send her back to her man
Maybe some different time our paths will cross and then we'll drink some wine
And we'll fuck and we'll kick it, smoke weed for a minute
You'll end up a verse when I think of a line
Or when I need a muse on a record just like this one
And then when she hears it, she's so amused
She think it's her but it's just fun
I mean really now, it ain't just one
I mean really now, when I jot this it's just a stream of my consciousness
When I touch on these topics
I'm thinking 'bout when she's topless
Out on vacations going in the tropics
That was before we broke apart just like chopsticks
Now I know our past it ain't spotless, nah but we got this
Girls slip away and then find their way inside flows
Guess I could've took that chance I suppose
But that's life and the way that shit goes, she knows
Yeah, she knows (Kehlani)
[Verse 2: Kehlani]
I always wondered 'bout why you let me go
Why you let me walk, up on out that door
We just went out for drinks
Then you took me home, walked me to my porch
Where you turned me on
That night you told me that you heard it in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Said you was scared to come fuck with me cause you see I'm chasing dreams
But that mean that I don't need no love

[Hook: Kehlani]
So tonight you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted, everything you wanted boy
Don't let that get away, don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away, don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away, don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I know we fell out of touch and this probably won't amount to much
But if we're trying to get back to where it got away
I'mma stay, not about to rush
All the fights and the bouts and such
Your best friend hate it but she doubts a bunch
You make the call, I know I've been gone for long
But rainfall after droughts are lush
Shoulda-wouldas always crossed my mind
Years passed guess we lost the time like a misplaced watch
To be straight up like I sip straight scotch, know I crossed a line
But what if it seems that the dreams we both chase
Conflict with each other's then there won't be no space
To make a home now when you know there's no place
I guess there'll always be a part I won't face
Real life and that's why I left with no trace
Knew I couldn't answer the ""please don't go"" face
Know your lifestyle's a slow pace, I like that
But right now I feel like my life's a boat race
Yeah it's sad but we're worlds apart
And life is short
Maybe I was made the villain but I'mma save this feelin'
For a song that I might record
Wait...53Embed"

In West Hollywood, she Uptown
And she dance to her favorite song
And sing along when no one's around
I will remember you

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Yeah, back when the first time we met
I was thinkin' 'bout sex but you told me not yet
I meant no disrespect I was just being honest, my only regret was
Never letting you know how I felt or what was up
That was too much Maker's in my cup
I was faded, too fucked up
And you probably think I'm an asshole
Read your facial expression
But it's not everyday someone comes and leaves an impression
Typin' shit to say to you then deletin' it on my phone when I'm textin'
Cause I still be thinkin' about you like every day, no question
But, I ain't really tryin' to fly out
And I'm no good at phones
And my life is on the road
I'm with the crew of Rolling Stones, but don't trip

In West Hollywood, she Uptown

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
See I know I've got this tendency to fall in love real quickly
But it's usually a phase I fall into in every city
That passes away instantly
When I leave it's over
I come to my senses when I'm sober
But I thought about you, no lie
When I left, you stayed on my brain
Then we finally got to fuck, and that shit was all the way insane
Now I know that you're havin' a thought
Picture us having a spot
But look at this baggage I got
My life is crazy, I travel a lot
But, when I dip out in the morning you can trust
I'll be thinkin' about you looking out the window of my bus

[Chorus: Blackbear]

And this verse is just a method to communicate
Stunt on everybody just so you can hate
I think I'm the one, I'll show you why then let you debate
So direct, shoot it straight
If you just heard about me then you're stupid late
Get right or get left ho, choose a fate
Follow no one I move at my own pace, you can wait
Notice how you stop touching bread like you're losing weight
One day you will see why I'm truly great
I be on the road till I'm old like Willie Nelson is back
20k for a verse you need some help on a track
And I swear I've been all the way to hell and I'm back
Without a cosign at all I put myself on the map
I was chilling with a girl that I just met
Mid conversation got impatient
So I asked her can we fuck yet?
Guess that she was upset
That was about the time she stormed off, steaming mad
She was bad but I just let
Her go, why you sweat girls like a fur coat
In the summertime? You're a nerd bro
Never leave work never furlough
Think you're fucking with me? K, sure bro
Ready all times say the word go
Sippin' drinking merlot, started drinking early
Still the same Gerald half killer, half nerdy
So far, my 20's they've been one hell of a journey
Bob Dylan told me don't trust no one over 30
Damn, draped in Saint Laurent and Supreme
Amount of money that I spend on what I want is obscene
All surreal how we live this good off of a dream
And I swear I do it all for the team
Drunk off of the Heem
Truly feel I'm the coldest alive
All I do is work, focus, and strive
Split a swisher, roll a fatty I'mma smoke this and drive
I'm a threat, now some of you can really only hope to survive
Grab a glimpse I'm as rare as it gets
Forget whoever else you might've thought was apparently next
Out here and I'm blessed
I come to town and every girl in the city's at my show and all the parents get stressed
I'm maneuvering with flair and finesse
Working out so I could carry the west
I'll prepare for the test and I'm ready after 5 sets
Lift the whole bay with my biceps
Caution if you try to follow my steps
You will trip and fall get exhausted and collapse
Most of these haters carry germs so I'm cautious giving daps
I just can't fuck with everyone my circle stays the same size
Enjoy the lifestyle that fame buys
After party is at Drai's in Vegas where they have the view
Get some girls, grab a few but only bring the baddest through
Rappers imitate the style, I'm not even mad at you
I'm not even throwing shade, I just overshadow you
Yeah I'm in my own lane, run my own pace
Chasing nobody marathon my own race
I do it for the bay area that's home base
They try to run next to us but there ain't no space
I feel like life just switched to hyperspeed though as of recent
The difference between yourself and me is you're just decent
A garden full of flowers grew its way up through the cement
If I ever said I'm never scared just know I really mean it
I dreamed about the top I had a vision and I seen it
If you know the work comes first then you and I are in agreement
And it's a long haul but I work harder than them all
So come back in 5 years and we can talk about achievement
[Skit/Outro]
[Reporter]: Hey let me ask you something. Do you worry about achievement? Does it worry you or do you just do your own thing and say ""here it is you either accept it or not""?
[Tom Waits]: Well, do I worry about achievement?  No I worry about a lot of things but I don't worry about achievement

Do anything to get ahold of my semen

This is life here, nothing faze me
What can I say? Bruh, this town is crazy
Left the club with my newest lady

Lost my mind, I won't stop until it's found
It's way up there, I might have to pull it down

More than '99, I ain't about to count
Takin' long walks when I'm out and about
Dreaming 10 mil just to round amount
Used to look for direction, till I found a route
Wonder how the charts feel
Paranoia thoughts stay dark, still
Everyday I'm here I try to write songs
Cause I know the beat'll longer than my heart will
Yeah, tryna see every state
No white lighters, hope I see 28
You can tell my girl i'mma be runnin' late
Can't tell how much longer she's gonna wait
A real good girl with a dirt bag guy
She could probably do better than me
Like a rich-ass lawyer with a house and car
Who takes care of her and never leaves
Man, shit I try my best
Nobody here for me to try and impress
I'd rather chase a dream
Than be content to sit behind a desk
I used to live with the highest stress
But fuck it, I digress

Lately I've been losing sleep
Stressed, sorry if my mood is deep
No one to talk to, I use the beat
A couple bad habits that I choose to keep
My intake of booze is steep
Pop a couple of pills that I use to sleep
I think I took a few this week
I'm trying to adjust to the hugest leap
I'm living off this music, here
But I'm afraid of failing
That's the truth, sincere
My anxiety is getting too severe
But I ain't giving up, there's no excuses here
Dying young might be my truest fear
But now my future's bright and my view is clear
Told her i'mma get it, i'mma do it, dear
There's no way in hell I could lose this year
I worked 10 years 'fore it ever paid off
You don't know what I had to trade off
I shed tears when my moms got laid off
Life's never fair, it never plays soft

Now I got these A list chicks, all in my jeans
Five eight and she only weighs a hundred and twenty
Skinny but she's got an ass the conundrum is funny
And you don't have to like me, just the balls to tell me
When your girl needs D then she calls the celly
Now they see me coming up, is when they all get jelly
Karate kid, my sensei is Fonzerelli
That's forty, I come from the land of the hyphy
My club is all pros like the brand of a white tee
Only a million dollars in my hand will excite me
And I tour across the atlas then I plan to go sight see
I never talk back when you're trying to diss us
Cause my response when we know you're lying is crickets
If I ain't poppin please explain who's buying the tickets?
And my deal's not a deal it's like they're buying a business, yeah

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
You could be anything in this world
You could be anything in this world
Momma said, you could be anything in this world
You could be anything in this world
But of all things in this life you could pick to be
You sure look like a hater or a bitch to me
Of all things you could pick to be
You sure look like a bitch to me
[Verse 2: Too $hort]
They call me short but I started at the top
NorCal bitch if you like it or not
It is what it is, it's an Oakland thing
What you doing short?
I'm just smoking man
I got her thinking I'm the man to be
Fuck with me, this ain't no fantasy
We them real Bay Boys, all we do is make noise
We ain't never been quiet come through and take hoes
I hope he don't get mad cause she want me
I really don't want her I just want to get money
You can see me, cupcake give a fuck what you think
She's a rich girl, and I'm in love with her bank (wassup)
You wanna be like her? wanna car like that?
Wanna be my work? I'll be your mentor baby
I make you a motherfucker
You take all this money and that other sucker, biatch

[Chorus: G-Eazy & Too $hort]
You could be anything in this world
You could be anything in this world

You could be anything in this world
But of all things in this life you could pick to be
You sure look like a hater or a bitch to me
Of all things you could pick to be
You sure look like a bitch to me
[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
I leave the club with a bad one, head right to my spot
Put some Ty Dolla on and put pipe in the thot
Got a style the world likes it a lot
I get on tracks spit, sneeze, cough, and throw up
I'm not wiping the snot
On my way if you like it or not
I'm looking at the top I'm just eyeing the spot
And I just keep climbing I been hiking a lot
If you told me these things would all happen
You'd be right on the spot
Yeah, cause ever since I was able to grow fame
My superpower's I can swoop your girl with no game
Straight to the point with no shame
Spot her at the party I'm a long distance sniper with pro-aim
If you're a bitch then respect you won't gain
Most of these cats are so lame
Rapper fell off turned into a no name
Lost it all and now you're trying
To grow your buzz back like Rogaine
It won't

[Chorus: G-Eazy]
You could be anything in this world

But of all things in this life you could pick to be

Let's go
Party in a penthouse, until I pass the fuck out
Reminiscing being broke and hoping I would luck out
Now-a-days I pull hoes; Swinging, never struck out
Reinvested everything, just trying to get a buck out
Will I ever make it? Felt fear on my life
For a while was going through a nervous patch
Then I had the most insane year of my life
Crazy, cause I only saw the surface scratched
Yeah, waking up next to a random girl I never knew
Goin' after Marilyn's instead of Sue's
Tryna bring her backstage then see what she let me do
Till security was like, ""wait up, who the fuck are you?""
Set backs of being almost on
Opening up the shows I'm trying to get noticed on
Labels calling the telephone that I wrote this on
But I press decline, hit notes, and keep on going on
Take a look at us, it's what you call a team
Freight train, I'm leading everybody, full of steam
Drinking simultaneously, rolling collard greens
Maybe I was higher than a bitch and this was all a dream
Still killing shows with Blizzy
'Member being in his Jeep and riding through the city
Played him Endless Summer said get used to staying busy
Cause you'll never get a fallback, let's go and get a milli
Brought him on tour just to live it
Poppin after parties with some girls who want to give it
All my close homies keep me grounded like a pivot
Talkin' about a way to get it, we already did it!
Switchin' lanes when that Porsche shifts
Homies movin' weight just like a forklift
When my album drops, Jedis can feel the force shift
Meanwhile, you lyin-ass rappers droppin' horse-shit
Only pay attention if you pay me
Chilling with a Sarah and a Vicky and a Jamie
Just a young man living life, could you blame me?
Overcast is snowy but the titty bar is rainy
Dreaming of a million while I sleep on satin
Homies always telling me ""just keep on rapping""
I'mma blow the fuck up while you sleep on napping
Fuck you want me to say?

Made a promise to myself, a promise I should stick to
Talkin' to myself, I said I promised I would quit you
I've been trying to let go, but it's powerful, it grips you
First, you think you got control until I see you, can't resist you
Know I got my issues, some I won't admit to
No one's got the answers, everybody wants to fix you
Got this magic 8 ball, but I ain't got no crystal
Just don't fall in Courtney Love
And don't go Cobain with no pistol (No pistol)
It don't take a psychic or a scientist to know that (Know that)
Then why the fuck the minute I see you, I always go back? (Go back)
The definition of insanity is
Yeah, I know that
I had a hundred chances to move on, I always

Lie to myself every time I say that I'm done with you
Every day without you passes slower than one with you
Two days pass, it's feelin' like a week, this shit is stressful
I swear all these helpin' hands ain't even helpful
Wishin' I was closer to you, wish you wasn't distant
Wishin' I was with you, still wish this shit was different
Wishin' we could travel back in time and we could switch it
All this pain, wishin' it was something that could fix it
Medicate myself, different substances, I mix it
Set my limits, try to draw the line and then she sniffs it
Never lied, I give you my word and then you twist it
Fights outside the club, I think the paparazzi
Think the paparazzi flicked it (Think the paparazzi flicked it)
Yeah, still can't seem to find out what's the issue
Hate the way you talkin' when you with your friends, too

Yeah, I swear I fall in love
With every gorgeous face
Can’t tell when it’s for real
Or if it’s only for the chase
Never poor mistakes
Always sure to win this race
And she was starin’ like it was no one else up in this place
So I throwed one back
Ice is all that go with Jack
Goin’ ham, I’m buyin’ drinks
I’ll mess around and blow a stack
Oh, and most of all these other fools you know is wack
But sleep with me, you won’t be goin’ back
But why are we talking all up in this club?
Should be on a bed or a couch or a rug
If I’m too blunt, it’s probably because
I’m feeling these drinks that I’ve already chugged
My apologies, your qualities are perfect
And if you let me take you somewhere
Bet you it’d be worth it, so

[Hook: Devon Baldwin]
I know something we both can do
But first I gotta be alone with you
I need ya so bad
My love, you drive me mad
I know something we both can do
But first I gotta be alone with you
I need ya so bad

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
You’ve got me goin’ mad
Crazy, just a tad
All that I can think about, I need you so bad
I swear this is the whole truth, all that I can tell you
And this ain’t even game or no dream I’m tryna sell you
My darling, you’re the baddest, ass is the fattest
I want you tonight like Glados
Are you single? What’s your status?
I can see you on my mattress
I know you been on that Drizzy, you been busy with some practice
If you’re down just let me know
She told me there’s a place that we could go
I said please, passin' keys in the bathroom, doin’ blow
So let’s bounce, but let’s keep this on the low
Just so they don’t know exactly where we went to go

Hope you recognize before I fall apart
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart
And I've been waiting for a long, long time
Sometimes I wonder what made me start
The one question staying on my mind
Is why you keep playing with my heart

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I keep saying Imma' change, Imma' change
I'm 22 now it's time to fucking act my age
And I just keep telling her this is just a stage
Where every other night we go party and we rage
And umm.. I be fucking up I know
I'm so immature, I just hope she doesn't know
She's thinking about peacing fast if he doesn't grow up
In the next 5 minutes then she'll up and go
And I'm just saying wait up
Let me show and prove
I know I did some things that you really won't excuse
You really got something I don't want to go and lose
But then she cut me off like when you blow a fuse
And she said to me

Is why you keep playing with my heart

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
See I fucked around and always cut it close
Sex is like a drug, I always need another dose
I swear I got a problem they can't even diagnose
And I always seem to stumble every time I try to coast
Saying adios to the groupies
Hello again to you
I swear you got something only shown in a few
And much, much better is what I'm goin' to do
And not sweat someone so miniscule
Have you ever loved somebody
That didn't love you back enough?
Brings on a bunch of extra baggage like you packing stuff
I apologize cuz' I know you really had it rough
It's my word, Imma' stop acting up

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Shit, the world is in flames
We worry about materials and the simplest things
When cops are killing people, and they can't take the blame
They get acquitted, then you wonder why all the people rage, stupid
We all keep praying for peace, praying for progress
If you live in the hills then you stay in the projects
So folks won't listen if they think what I'm saying is conscious
They'd rather hear me turning up on some simpler topics
Yeah, so what's my place, am I outta line?
Then speaking on what's going on and saying what's on my mind?
This shit is fucked up, plus it's happening all the time
My job, as a rapper is to entertain, we tryna shine
I'm not no politician, but they listen, somebody inform 'em
All the kids gotta find out what's really important
I got a platform and a voice and a stage to perform on
Music could be a good escape, but outside it's been storming, yeah

Bend until we break, stand by and watch us all go up in flames

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
As I sit in the studio, guess the thinking is
If the statement's too crazy, then should I finish this?
Or if my image is pretty, don't wanna blemish this
Or ever split up my fans, reduce my relevance
Pay attention and understand what the premise is
Everything not gravy, we can't pretend it is
So I salute YG, fuck the president
'Cause he a fucking racist supported by white supremacists
Fuck Donald, go back to just running businesses
We all wishing somehow we could've prevented this
Until we all love each other, nobody benefits
Minorities and feminists, trans, gays, and immigrants
The government mix politics and religiousness
So a man's body's more free than a woman's is
The anger is real, the riots are limitless
And nothing's gonna change 'til we killing off all this ignorance, yeah

I would die a legend if today they JFK'd me

I never gave a fuck, a million dollars couldn't change me
As long as Mark Zuckerberg's still got that zipped hoodie
I think about the journey and think what it did to me
I'm eating like a king until I've got a big tummy
Hair slicked backwards with a skin fade taper

She said I drive her Mad, Gerald's rap's Don Draper
All day I touch paper, bitch don't ask me no favor
If you wasn't here before it, your call, I ignore it
How quickly they forgive, these days I swear I can't support it

She just so bad, make you take a second look
I fly out for a week, she just come to fuck and cook
And post by the pool, with her feet up, read a book
I text her ""L.A.?"" that was all it took
She clicks her heels three times, she'll be here by tonight
I text my travel agent name and birthday, it's a flight
When we was broke, I used to tell my moms we'd be alright
I'm gonna work the long nights and never be a fly-by-night
I put my plans in motion, I fly across the ocean
I popped before the flight so I could sleep and dream in motion
And I be out in London, Dover Street, I goes in
Fuck that after-party money, spent that on some clothing
And I'm not trying to flex on those who be hatin'
This is for my all little bruhs, just some inspiration
Everybody back home, serves as motivation
So go and get the money, get the dreams you been chasing

I'm in this for the longest haul like we'll see where it takes us
I'm throwing back these double shots like whiskey here is weightless
Cause, cause this career I chose was even riskier than Vegas
Yo, you playing no one's in the crowd like it's Pistons-Bucks
Burning sour down for all the days I pissed in cups
And I'll be working 'til I'm rich as fuck
On my own grind, I'm a rebel to the system cause the system sucks
See I'm going places most people ain't seen
And I'm living out a life that most people would see and feign
And everyone's a rapper but everything ain't what it seems
Most people can't run all to well when they're chasing a dream
Yo, think about it, if you ain't catch it that's just what I mean
You try to run fast after something and you run out of steam

Truthfully is gravy, every man alive is not a star
But everybody thinks they are, my oh my, how bizarre
It's whatever, let it run its course I'm about to roll this gar
And you can talk shit all you want but see your ho is wet
And this shit I got on is fucking cool you just don't know it yet

But first you got to see your homies do it then you go and get
Fuck off, I don't care what you think of me at all

Talking 'bout my crazy-ass ex
Somehow I still failed her last test
Few years the last time we had sex
So why you call me trippin', all mad pressed?
All them lies that you was tellin' on me
Hopin' I lose, you hope an L is on me
She would tell anybody, she'd go and tell her homie
She would go on TV, she'd go on Ellen on me
Send them shots, just know I'm hard to kill
Put away feelings I used to feel
So sick, you know what? The part that's ill
Watch out, remember, karma's real
That bullshit comes back to bite you
Threw a party, mad I ain't invite you
Selfish to assume it's all spite you
You can hate me now, you got the right to

[Chorus]
I had, I had, I had enough
You had, you had, you had enough
We fell out of love
We fell out of love (Uh)
[Verse 2]
Rebounds, I see who I'm replaced with
You took no time, you can't waste it
You dragged my name, I don't say shit
But let somebody say ""G-Eazy,"" you go apeshit
Thank God we stay split
I don't have it in me to hate shit
If I told you the truth, you can't take shit
You can't have a good thing, you love to break shit
It's been this long so why you callin' me?
Texting the homies, you re-followed me
Asking about me, you want all the tea
Probably ain't turning out how you thought it'd be, huh?
That bullshit comes back to bite you
Leave me alone, I don't like you
Scribble you out and rewrite you
I don't hate you now but got the right to (Haha, you know? Haha)

I just wanna chill and tuck off with a bad one
Man, y'all be stressing me, ah, fuck I need a Valium

And now I spent that on some dinner, eat Italian (yeah, linguine!)
We really did it, bruh, we came up from the bottom (yeah)
It's what it is, I swear I see it how I call it (yeah)
I swear you're lookin' like a L, you're not far from it (yeah)
And I just go into the booth and then I vomit (yeah)

But if she ain't the baddest, then I put her in main cabin (sorry)

Carefree, but there's a dark side that haunts this
Paparazzi gossip, loves to watch this
But drugs take me away when I pop this

'Rari like a Nascar in a drag race
Zoom, zoom, why the fuck are you in last place?
Need to catch up where I'm at, that's a fast chase
Uh, take a shot 'cause you're drinking slow
Pour a glass, but nothing's chasing my whiskey though
So, if you didn't know now, I'm a savage
And this has already been established
Your friends tried to dip, but you here, you're not trying to go
If you ain't ready for it all, good, let me know
I looked her in her eyes, she stared back all silent
When I told her I'm the devil, I was smiling

Yeah, but no lie, you're attracted to it
A good girl, but you're scared that it's bad to do it
Life is sin, every night we get back into it
But, see, I live in this place, you just passin' through it
Welcome to my world, let me walk you through it
If you step inside the Matrix, ain't no dodgin' bullets
Ain't no fairy-tale, welcome to the darker side
Moon rocks, a glass of water, now she's on a ride
Yeah, she's like ""damn, y'all are wildin'""

Fell asleep in a freshman class, woke up on a tour bus
Somehow, someway, all my test questions passed
And I didn't even take shortcuts
Man, life is but a dream, ""is this shit real?""
So trill, yeah I'm rollin' at night, I can't sit still
Five mixtapes can't change up my social status
And my balance, but a Top 40 hit will
Shit, I know they see me, don't question them
Dreams of being on TV, no Requiem
I just want to live this dream, will it be what I imagined
But nothing tops making a living off your passion
So either way I'm chasing after something I ain't never had
Woke up today feeling hungry as I ever have
And I don't usually ever brag
But these dreams aren't far anymore, you can tell them that

[Hook: Johanna Fay]
These plastic dreams (plastic dreams) of TV screens and radios (radios)
Pretending everything is what it seems
These plastic dreams (These plastic dreams) are all I know
Would someone wake me up from all these plastic dreams

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
I never love bitches, I love money and my city
Love my whole team, 'bout to bring them all with me
I'm headed to the top of this, I'm taking 'bout the tippy
Hittin' parties with a couple A-list, gettin' trippy
Feeling myself and I ain't even did shit yet
Cause rap is 'bout to feed me out paper like an Inkjet
When I see these girls in the crowds sing my words all loud
I be tryin' see how many I can get wet
Snatch them like a fishnet, game so viscous
Me and Skizzy Mars and like 38 bitches
It's all I could do so I'mma bag two yo
As long as I don't ever smash 'em raw, no Juno
Listen, I just made my own lane and these rappers went piranha on me
Biting off everything, my style and my persona
Homie, I just keep dreaming of the day I bang Rihanna
They say ""I'm a dreamer"", I say ""wait until mañana""

Skip the bitch like a beat
Snort cocaine, drink, then repeat
I ain’t slept in 'bout like a week
See, this lifestyle, it ain’t cheap
But when I pop bottles, it’s free
Tell all my bruddas we all in the section
But trust me, the section, it isn't on me
See the flow, I dun did it
Poppin' off like prescription
Kill the beat, G the witness

Your main hoe is my fitness
I like 'em stick-thin and titless
I pray to God as my witness
I pray I make right decisions
‘Cause if I left, they’d be trippin’

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Label me as a bad guy
Safe bet, I'm the anti
Chastise, throw dirt on me
That's how it is, don't ask why
Everyone's got their opinion
But I don't know why cats lie
I would never let that fly
Honestly, I'm not that guy (I'm not that guy)
Now, don't believe everything you hear
All these people wanna interfere
Fuck 'em all, it's our world
Can't let 'em get into here
We could really build something strong
Think where we could be in a year
You've gotta give me a fair chance
Before you tell me we're finished here
Already know you've been hurt before
Understand what you're afraid of
Talk's cheap, actions speak
Let me show you, I'm demonstrative
We could rewrite the old story
Let's get it started, let's get creative
'Cause I'm the one
Honesty and loyalty is what I'm made of
[Chorus: Madison Love]
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don't hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty
Don't mess around with boys like you
Mama always told me, Papa always warned me
Don't hang around with boys like you
Teacher always told me never to be naughty

Wishin' I could say goodbye to being broke, and say hello to bread
But I'm broke and my grass looks yellow and dead
But the jello is red, and it's green in my bag
So i'll chill out and roll a cigarillo instead
I been waitin' for a minute
Feelin' as though I been comin' with it ever since the television was invented
I been looking thru the glass I just wanna get up in it
Seein' rappers on and they don't even know the business, like...
Like I'm knowin' that I'm better than you
Seein what these rappers gettin' to do
Going crazy
I ain't got much weed left, but my brethren do
Need some tree, need some whiskey an excedrin too
Man I'm stressed out... but it's looking up and thats a start
Might not be on the radio but this is art
I just wanna get by that's the biggest part
I'm in my 20s still feeling like a kid at heart
Lost in this young world, I'm just tryna navigate
See the pie sliced I'm just tryna grab a plate
We see commercials we infatuate
Wishing I was born rich with a fat estate

[Hook]
Must be nice
To wake up to a beautiful view
Must be nice
To be a one-per-center in the chosen few
Must be nice
To live a life of luxury
Must be nice
Must be nice
[Verse 2]
And when we fast forward to the good life's a hell of a trip
Except now-a-days its like my whole perspective is flipped
Used to wish that I would have shows
Now I tour 6 months out the year and its nothin now to bag ho's
Blowin kush when I wake up yeah the scent is strong
Then I'm pulling these balenciaga denims on
One leg at a time just like you
Except I'm making gold records from a nice view
Tryna stay humble while I get cashed out
Racks on racks, credit cards never maxed out
Making more then my parents did
That ain't saying much, but its still a mind fuck, yeah
Eating out, reading menus slow
Back then my wallet would decide what I chose
Now its white table cloths wearing nice clothes
Flying out for shows and my whole team goes

[Hook]

To wake up to a beautiful view
Must be nice
To be a one-per-center in the chosen few

People talk, it's just word of mouth
No, it ain't nothing to me
You talking loud cause I'm not around
Yeah, that's something to see
Say I’m the man and I'm winning now
That shit ain't nothing to me
And all these hunnids that I'm pulling out
It's a lot to you but ain't nothing to me
It's a lot to you, It's a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me
It's a lot to you, It's a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
You dipped ya toe inside that water while I'm chest high
Explains all this basicness that you get impressed by
Tall and lanky so I'm not even a flex guy
Commercial melodies to pay to have them jets fly
No more coach and until the day I die stiff
I am at a level most of y'all be satisfied with
Want some advice well here's my gift:
You’re falling off you should go speed up the process
Go somewhere and find a high cliff
Oh, it's all coming back to me now
You saw me hot and got signed now you actually foul
Time is money I ain't wasting none, it has to be now
The word legend's thrown around so causally now
I want it all, pardon my manners
But you've done nothing that matters
Maybe I am not understanding your standards
See we measured in the money that you made, short
It's not the same league, it's not even the same sport, now
[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
People talk, it's just word of mouth
No it ain't nothing it me
You talking loud cause I'm not around
Yeah that's something to see

It's a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me
Its a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And I remember I was stacking money
Though I wanted clothes and Jordans, leather jacket money
Now I want tobacco money
Where everything you sell, they keep on coming back to money
And I ain't even close to gotti yet, don't get confused
But everybody got choices, you can pick and choose
These people disrespect the game until it gets abused
They saying Gerald's 'bout to kill 'em, but this isn't news
See, you're a player in the game, but playing different rules
You struggling, guess we'll just wait to see if this improves
You had a chance at the dance, but was missing queues
You couldn't get the steps down, cause these are different moves
Pay attention, life is like a dice game, your life is like a bike lane
There's more to buy then just a nice chain
New flavor for you cause your life's plain
A day inside the life with us could make your life change, yeah
[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
People talk, it's just word of mouth
No it ain't nothing it me
You talking loud cause I'm not around
Yeah that's something to see

And all these hunnids that I'm pulling out
It's a lot to you, but ain't nothing to me
Its a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me
It's a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Cause when you used to it, other people ain't used to it
They only copy when you do do it
Cause when you used to it, other people ain't used to it
They only copy when you do do it

[Verse 3: E-40]
I'm the realest in it, but ya'll don't show it
But in the back of ya'll motherfucker's mind ya know it
I'm a poet with versatility, biggie gave me 0 visibility
Wish him and the homie Pac was still alive
If they was, rap would be more live
But they not, so I'm filling in they space
Rap game Mount Rushmore, they carving out my face
I done seen fly-by-nights on the cover of source  and XXL
Me and hip-hop thought about getting divorced and that's for real
But I stay loyal to the broad that saved my life, my wife
If it wasn't for rap, I would've crapped out on the dice

Spread your wings

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I should have known, but this won't ever work here
Honestly realized it way back in our first year
I'm not even religious, but hope there's a church near
It's whiskey on my lips and it's been too much thirst here
My lifestyle is gettin' outta hand
I come down and take a Xan
Did too much blow tonight, I try to sleep, but I can't
Ignoring phone calls, when she hit me I don't answer
'Cause I'm faded, I ain't tryna listen to another lecture
These drugs are the only way I'm escapin' from the pressure
You don't know what it's like for me, you got no way to measure
She said ""I know you well, why you don't let me in to help you?
These groupies at these parties, they don't even know the real you
I'm worried about you, hope you never do enough to kill you
Decide what you want, 'cause I can only wait until you-
Push me so far, then I've got nothing else to tell you
If I don't make you happy, hope success and all the wealth do
[Chorus: Ugochi]
Little bird, little bird, little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
The toughest part is letting go
Million times you saw the cliff, but never jumped to end it though
Mistakes can always turn into another lesson though
Say I'm selfish, but you're telling me what I already know
If you were smart you would run away and never let me know-
Where you went, so I can't chase you there; fly away and go
Don't ask about me, you'll be happier the less you know
Nothing'll change if we keep staying put like we're in control
But you just don't budge, you just like an old judge
Can't you see we got stains on this? This is no smudge
If only we could live with no liquor, no drugs
You got every right to hate me, but you still hold no grudge
You gotta go, even though it hurts, is this for certain?
Even though I'd hate to see you with another person
And even though you'll always be there in my heart just lurkin'
Haunting me, I gotta find myself and now I'm searchin'
[Chorus: Ugochi]
Little bird, little bird, little bird, little bird
Spread your wings
And fly away
Little bird, little bird, little bird
Won't you spread your wings
And fly away?

[Bridge: G-Eazy]
I wish you happiness, one day you'll find the right one
You're a queen, you deserve to be treated like one
Vacation for the mind every time I go to light one
Karma is a bitch, I'm well aware one day it might come
Yeah, one day it might come
(Fuck....yeah)

Cocaine clouds, eyelids peeled
Thirty thousand feet, up's how it feels
Homemade straws, hundred dollar bills
Overflowing cups, 'til the glass fills
Looking down on the earth, marijuana fields
Uh, synthesize capsules and pills
Hollywood castles, the hills
Do it all, wonder will we live past the thrills?
Yeah, pay the prices for a nice trip
Yeah, vices got me in a vice grip
Numbing, can't feel my lip
Wondering “when will I slip?”

Yeah, I tell my story and they listen to it

Yeah, when she hit me, I'll be there again
I swear that pussy's like heroin
Used rubbers, dirty sheets, at the Sheraton
Check your pockets for them drugs you been carrying
Uh, hope you got something for the come down

When I play with death, I display talent
Outta' cash buying drugs, can I PayPal it?
Don't talk about it, she'd just stay silent
The Beautiful & Damned, tryna find balance, yeah
She wants molly, she wants all that
I call once and then I call back
If my dealer don't respond back
The whole world's going all black
Yeah, can't handle her, she's out her head
Yeah, and then she looked at me and then she said
""I hope you make it in Heaven for a half hour""

Okay you know it's whiskey straight no chases
Yeah I've been a few places
From Montana to Indiana these girls know what my pace is
First night with your girlfriend we ran a couple of bases
We made it home I dug her out then I made her one of my aces
Marijuana fragrance this tree here is outrageous
Want me to play in your city send an email to my agents
I'm working in the studio I tell my fans have patience
Because once I drop this new shit then it's on I'm off to them races
Yeah lanky as a mother fucker rap game Jack Skellington
I will surely blow up soon that's what I've been telling them
Most the time I'm lurkin in New Orleans like a pelican
Walking in the party dapper looking like Duke Ellington
Yeah always wear a latex when I skeet
Got Balenciagas on I got your paycheck on my feet
Rappers hit me up for tracks I need your paycheck for a beat
At my stay at home job wearing gray sweats in my suite
Man this shit ain't got no concept I just felt like rappin
Started writing lyrics and then I just felt like snappin
See I'm trekking past the stars I swear I just felt like captain
Man I smoked a blunt then smoked two more then I just felt like nappin
When given my druthers I'm mixing downers with uppers
Shouts goes out to Splurgeboys I only rap over thumpers
First I got with this babe and then I moved on to her mother
I just came through and fucked her afterwards she cooked me supper
You can hate me all you want to but my rents paid
Off of writing rap songs I got my ends made
I get bitches plus I even get my friends laid
You see the girl I'm with you probably wish you can trade
Ok I'm killing y'all on this music shit
Sophisticated flows went to school and shit
You should really know who you're fooling with
I'm too legit I do this shit
We don't drink vodka I'm drinkin that brown

Yeah, I don't know, probably give it to charity or somethin'
Every girl nowadays wanna marry me or somethin'
Hate that shit, all I needed was a pic
But yo ass always sendin' me a narrative or somethin'
Naked pic of tits bitch, I ain't even knowin' it
Boyfriends hate me and I ain't even noticin'
Lemme tie a girl down, I ain't never roll with them
Hella blunts heavy but I'm second hand smoking them
Really real, it's me and Gerald, tell all those lame niggas hide their girls
Going dumb 'till I'm numb, couldn't even tell your ass how this feels
Trying to write a rap when you're drunk is a skill though
Bottles and bars and they're both being killed though
Trying to talk to these bitches is hard
Cause I sound like Boomhauer from King of the Hill though
Girls do wanna come, wanna stay
Sex and Super Smash Bros, hoes wanna play
Truly fuckin' hard and I wasn't trying to party
But ah fuck it, okay, turn up!

When tomorrow comes, I'mma hate it

I been killin it for ages, always checkin ages
If she ain't tryna fuck the first night we're on different pages
We pre game then we party then the after party rages
After that is when the purple smoke billows up and hazes
I been going hammy ham
Chillin with a slammy slam

Of one night stands I am a fan

Fuck you and your mixtape boy I'm something of a music snob

If I don't know you I don't speak like a Hasidic Jewish mob

If you doing what I’m doing I can’t deal with it
Is you moving how I’m moving?
If you moving how I’m moving, I can’t live with it
Oh no, fuck the friend zone
Oh no, motherfuck the friend zone

We’re still fucking every time I’m in town
Hoes come around but you really been down
Heard through the grapevine you’re seeing him now
Looking for the one and you think he’s been found
Not true, that is not true
They could never understand what we’ve been through
Up at night thinking so I sent the text though
I’m just checking in like I hope you’ve been cool
Finishing school? that’s cool my congrats
Maybe we can finally do this at last
But these days the pace that I move at is fast
Maybe I’m just chasing what I knew in my past
Maybe this is pointless and I should probably leave you
Realize you’re living at a-whole-nother speed too
Maybe I just realized I really fucking need you
Or maybe I’ll just tell you all about it when I see you
Until then

And we both know we should let go
It doesn’t change the fact we keep on having sex though
Since the last time I guess if it helps though
But you’re really only lying to yourself though
Can’t resist you cause you got all the right stuff
If we was on the same page then I might cuff
They say relations don’t work for people like us
But then again we’re that crazy so it might just
And I know I still got some growing up to do
But you already know the deal this is nothing new
Yeah, you know I treat you better than most others do
I’m something different than the rest, even your mother knew
She asks about me to the point she almost smothers you
You can’t sleep you’re still up at two
So you decide to call me, I bring those rubbers through
Cause we can fuck it’s all good if you want, it’s just up to you

She know the deal, we fuck second and we blaze first
She had some work done, just so she don't age worse
She'll fuck me five times, all in a day's work
But won't clean the sheets up, that's the maid's work

Uh-huh, and the pages of Vogue set her trends
She looks in the mirror, thinks of who she's better than
Slides a bird to the bouncer that she know'll let her in
She's livin' in a fantasy she hopes'll never end, cause she's
19, with a fortune to blow
And she's never had to work, that's a fortunate ho
With a fortunate dro, and a fortune to blow
Munchin' Trix out an antique porcelain bowl
Yeah, we light up and smoke it all, we don't waste any
She make a THIZZ face every time she taste Henny
Sure, her body's lame, but her face pretty
She like to keep her nose runny and her waist skinny
I'm just a punk kid, and she's a rich girl
She's from the other side of town and that's a different world
But what she don't know is how to live a real life
She's a waspy girl, we party all night

And when they come home at night they say
(Whew) I love you, baby, baby, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba
My lady's fine but she bugs me all the time
We used get along but now all she does is whine
I sit around and wonder what she might just make up next
It's a drag but it's worth it for the make-up sex
For the make-up sex, for the, for the make-up sex
It's a drag but it's worth it for the make-up sex

[Verse 1]
See I been chillin', layin' low, stayin' in and blowin' dro
I got caught a week ago, so I'm just tryna slow my roll
It was good till Crystal called, she said she was lonesome so
I dicked her down and went back home
It's so hard to be wholesome, yo
My girl came in arguing about what she heard from so-and-so
Told her ""I don't know that ho they lying, I been going slow""
She wouldn't fucking let it go, ""I hate you G"" she said you know
But all I'm thinking is how make up sex gon' be incredible

Okay it started in the kitchen washing dishes
She was yellin' at me vicious about something
She had heard, from them bitches
I told her ""That's fictitious""
And she stopped and put the dishes down
Turned around looked and said she miss me when I'm not in town
But she doesn't trust me, thinks I'm always getting lucky
And she thinks I'm hooking up
With every groupie down to fuck me
I told her she's the one for me
Then she pulled down my trousers
And the next thing that you know
We were on top the kitchen counter going

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Uh, This wasn't typical for me don't confuse it
Only thing I've ever loved before you was music
Took my heart and bruised it, You ain't give a fuck
I guess you never know what you have til' you lose it
I know soon you'll probably see it all clear
And realize you lost a real love
Who was here for you unconditionally, but it's ugly
Now years down the line, you reminisce to the point you shed a tear
But I'll be long gone and I never will appear in you're life no more
So gimme 'bout a year, Turn on the radio and I'll be all that you can hear
And you'll be mad you ever went and let me disappear
Now it's only my dreams that I run to
It just sucks that one of them will never come true
You did some shit that you can't Apple ""Z"" undo
You cocked back and shot me down witch'ya gun boo
And I still got the wounds that'll prove it
What the fucks the point of having love if you lose it?
Took the energy, that's what I go into the booth with
Now I write a song from my heart, You abuse it
And paint the picture of a love lost
Now I know I can't afford the price love cost
Feelin' feeble and weak from the blood loss seeping from my chest
Now I know it just ain't what it once was
[Hook]
Til' now I always got by on my own (On my own)

I never really cared til' I met you (Til' I met you)

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And since you peaced every day has been a struggle to
Maintain sane when I know I'm still in love with you
Seeing you around with somebody else touchin' you, I'm sick to my stomach wondering is he fuckin' you?
And I know I'm buggin' too, wishin' I could let it go and stop thinkin' 'bout you
But I can't forget it though
You were my queen and you were my dream, til' you turned nightmare I just wanna scream
Somebody please pinch me, I just gotta wake up
I just keep missin' how it was before the break up
Stuck in the past when you were my ace
I just hope you know you could never be replaced
It burns like mace in my face, a vodka shot straight no chase, When I think of us being erased
But you don't feel the same, showin' no empathy
Whatever fuck it, I guess it wasn't meant to be
Aha ha, It is what it is, Take it how you want it.""

Yeah, Unfuckwithable
Black on black Vader, soundtrack is so cynical
It’s for certain, keep a cup of Bourbon it’s so critical
I’m just getting started, still a couple years from pinnacle
Lowkey I been killing y’all in another interval
You kiss that bitch, you imbecile, her mouth stay on my genitals
Text me ten times I never hit her back, pitiful
I hate how this industry is so fucking political
You should just sit down with all that bullshit go and get a stool
I just don’t believe you, don't know who you think that shit would fool
Yeah, legendary status what I must achieve
She came thru to smash right afterwards I made her up and leave
You don’t even know what I got up my sleeve
Told my team, “We’d make it in a second, trust me, just believe""
Yeah, rap game James Dean, been here
I’m just out here doing shit they ain’t seen
Swear this beat's too fucking hard, telling you bro, Kane's mean
Ever since eighteen, been focused on the same dream

[Hook]
Yeah, that was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Never looking back so far beyond y’alls range
That was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Came the fuck up since I was making y’alls wage
[Verse 2]
Well, the difference is nowadays I’m making like triple times your dividends
Walk my stage like Johnny Cash, hello to a massive crowd
Quiet but I’m passing loud, solid crew - no rats allowed
Everybody know I’m next to get it, you could ask around
Classic shit, that’s the sound, labels tryna track me down
Faked it ‘til I made it, everything’s official now
Don’t fit in, I stand apart from everybody, that’s just how
Everything I do, I put my name on as original
Skeet on a rich girl’s boobs and watch it trickle down
I want in on every dime bag or nickel now
Every rapper that I’m about to pass up's in a pickle now
Thought you had a home run? Just a foul
Silly stupid rapper, you won’t make it with that simple style
When I’m working I don’t fuck around, shouts to those who stuck around
Always through the up and down I am who they buzz around
Tell me now, how does it sound?
She knows when I come in town, she calls soon as I'm touching down

[Hook]
Yeah, that was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Never looking back so far beyond y’alls range
That was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Came the fuck up since I was making y’alls wage
[Verse 3]
Remember when I never had shit
Single parent struggles, mom’s always trying to mask it
Age sixteen I set a goal and now I’m past it
Following this dream, shouts to everyone who backs it
From interning, to the flagship
Jealousy is real, see these people talking mad shit
What you making now ain’t even fucking with my last shit
We're eating, get a basket, I’m in this ‘til the casket

[Hook]
Yeah, that was the day it all changed
Shit just got real, now they’re looking all strange
No longer on a small stage
Never looking back so far beyond y’alls range

Late nights with early mornings
With straight flights back to New Orleans
Trying to stay focused on what's important
The ones that matter, they stay supportin'
So I stay recording, my plane is boarding
Y'all are funny style just like Tracy Morgan
Haters speak but I straight ignore 'em
My lady's Greek and her face is foreign
Like every week I'm going places tourin'
Y'all are hella weak, the songs you make is boring

The anxiety I'm exhausted with
One day they'll say ""He just lost his shit""
Losin' sleep in the studio trying to make sure it's the hottest shit
But the fans get anxious like
""When the fuck are you dropping shit?""
Man come off of it, rappers dropping the softest shit
While I'm working 'til I'm on top of it
Never take a second and stop and sit and just watch a bit

Now I'm going crazy, basically
The album's coming, I promise y'all
You see how long it's taking me? Wait patiently
Since nine I've made my mind, them nine to five's just ain't for me
A dead end job's no place to be, star's what I'm on pace to be

No, I must have some esteem

I asked my momma will my dreams comes true
See I don't know where I'm headed but I know where I'm going
If you want you can follow me too
Run away me and you
Off to that endless summer

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Aye I went hard in the classroom
Simply cause I had my sights set around past June
Graduated chillin' hard in the afternoon
Contemplating verses that I put onto a track soon
Aye I went hard with my last tunes
Dropped The Outsider cause I knew that I'd be back soon
And now the whole world knows my nom de plume
Every time I spit I treat the booth like a bathroom
Grab some nuggets I'm a cannabis holder
I work for this life nobody handed this over
Close to my goals but I'll have to get closer
Deals on the tables now I'm after this closure
Every albums killing they like 'Can he get colder?'
G is who your Girlfriend's panties drip over
Chicks keep asking him ""Can he sleep over?""
I'm just doing what I'm supposed to
Don't get mad at me, joker
Aye

And all he do is travel town to town
Every night is Saturday, it's always going down
Just copped a million swishers like we're bout to blow a pound
If you been to a show you know that I could move a crowd
I've seen a whole country through the window of my van
They say I'm nice with it I'm just doing what I can
I chopped up the Beach Boys and made it to a jam
Cause everything I'm not made me everything I am
Inspired by the likes of Yeezy, Keith Haring Lil Weezy
Jean-Michel Basquiat to Jeezy
Banksy to the Beatles
Johhny Cash to The Beaters
Put it all up in the pot and that's what's coming through your speakers
I'm trying to be a legend
They tell me it'll come in time
But look around so does everyone so get in line
Man, I just want the whole world to see me shine
So I spend every waking minute on this dream of mine
[Hook: Erika Flowers]
I had a dream of a place where the sun shined bright
Off in that endless summer
And I wonder if
I asked my momma will my dreams comes true
See I don't know where I'm headed but I know where I'm going
If you want you can follow me too
Run away me and you
Off to that endless summer10Embed"

Keep on keep running
Running and running
Keep on keep running

[Verse 1]
And listen up, I'm from that Bay, (Yee!)
Where slang originates, don't even know what cats say
'06 I remember back in that day
A rubber band around a broken CD player slapping Mac Dre
And back then it was Girbauds wearing bigger clothes
The bay was popping, Keak da Sneak had different flows
And when '07 came, the hyphy movement's window closed
Hearts broke but fuck it, that's the way this business goes
But Uncle 40 Water kept it going
25 years in the game and he's still making choices
Then I moved to New Orleans where they shucking oysters
Everybody speak in southern voices
Home sick, I felt like this was pointless
Culture shock, like what's going on
Had me feeling like I don't belong
My bro said ""Look, this music's all that you should focus on""
They'll understand you soon, it won't be long

[Chorus: G-Eazy and Gabriel Garzón-Montano]
Nobody's perfect, yeah we act a fool
I'ma keep on running, nothing's new
Guess I'll keep doing what I naturally do
I'll always keep on running back to you
Yeah, they say, the more things change
The more they stay the same
So I'ma always play the game
Yeah, so if I lose today, then I'm not ashamed
'Cause times are gonna change
[Verse 2]
Skipping school, blowing blunts in the parking lot
Back in those days, used to spark a lot
Far fetched dreams we would talk about
Making it in rap, tryna start a plot
Tryna crack the code, how a star gets hot
But from where we standing, that's the farthest spot
Ash the blunt and mob cause the cops love to bark a lot
Always finding trouble, it don't matter if it's dark or not
Scrapping after school cause they love to test you
Just to see if you're a narc or not
And I remember what did move me
Is I was in juvie, never giving fucks, acting unruly
Being away from making music, I understood it then truly
And what it did to me
Ankle monitor for 6 months
I couldn't go outside, this shit sucks
Independent study, went to school just once a week
And spent every single other day home making beats
That's how it happened

[Chorus: G-Eazy and Gabriel Garzón-Montano]
Nobody's perfect, yeah we act a fool
I'ma keep on running, nothing's new
Guess I'll keep doing what I naturally do
I'll always keep on running back to you
Yeah, they say, the more things change
The more they stay the same
So I'ma always play the game
Yeah, so if I lose today, then I'm not ashamed
'Cause times are gonna change
[Verse 3]
Since curfews and cartoons, its been the same team
Just a few youngsters growing up who had the same dream
Moved away when I was 18
But Marty though, he had the car, he had the girls
So he just stayed put in the same scene
And I was jealous, in my eyes he had it
Living solo, had his hustle, spent his free time rapping
He said this shit ain't all that nice and that's what you forgetting
Promised if either of us makes it I'll come back and get them
Finally got a pop so hes coming on the road
And while we're touring everything is gold
When its finished then its back to work to grill food
I know you hate that 9 to 5, I know it kills you
Just know I feel you
I'm trying to fix shit up
I'm trying to make it so we all can chill and live it up
I'm throwing parties and my day ones right here in the cut
Yeah, that's the least bro you've been in my corner since the jump

[Chorus: G-Eazy and Gabriel Garzón-Montano]
Nobody's perfect, yeah we act a fool
I'ma keep on running, nothing's new
Guess I'll keep doing what I naturally do
I'll always keep on running back to you
Yeah, they say, the more things change
The more they stay the same

Yeah, I got it fam, yeah, young Gerald
All the way from the Bay Area to London
Overseas, across the pond
Yeah, let’s go, yeah

[Verse]
Hair slick backwards, I’m dapper
Your bitch is cool, mine is badder
You haters gossip and chatter
All my team we're eating as if we hunt and we gather
Your girl tweeted that I was her favorite rapper, I’m flattered
Yeah, some are still on the fence like “come convince me”
I was with your girl last night, she gave Lewinsky
It’s me against the world right now, don’t go against me
Cause every single thing that I do, I do intensely
I’m a safe bet while these others are sort of risky
When you think of G you think of the girls and all the whisky
Looking from a distance you think that I came up quickly
Yeah, if I ever kiss the game goodbye I’ll leave a hickey
Yeah, just tryna say I’ll leave my mark on it
Biggest journey starts right now, so I’ll embark on it
Man I hop on a track and I shart on it
Yeah, I eat beats I’m a shark on it
Paid dues and I kept my receipt
Hella hours in the studio, rehearse and repeat
So it’ll be a hundred years before I’m reaching a peak
I’m from the Bay bruh I grew up on 40 and Keak
Yeah, yeah and this shit was so unexpected
Son my flows unprecedented, they know I’m up next to get it
Your shit I’ve been unimpressed with
No I’m not the one to mess with
Move aside and make some room
I come through, make you wanna exit
Yeah, cause I’m arriving right on time
Wear a dozen socks to fit my shoes if you tried on mine
And I, have been killing shit lately
Everything is good, I’m never tripping off what they say
I’m with Westwood, overseas
Back from Amsterdam, we was blowing trees
It’s still the same team, yeah, I roll with G’s
I’m just tryna seize all these opportunities
Had your girl over tip-toeing in her socks
(Hahaha, yeah, ay, ay)
And I feel like we picked the locks
I’m not invincible but you can’t put me in a box
Yeah, it’s like I walk through walls
Man these hoes keep calling, I just dropped two calls
Ay, and I ain’t got two flaws, I got my word and I got two balls

Used to have no options, I can't pick or choose
Two yellow Lambos look like Pikachus
You just another person I don't pay attention to
But I just put your bitch on my list of things to do
'Cause lately I've been feelin' cruel
Vegas residency blew it all at the pool
At the high rollers table blowing condos like it's cool
They like, ""Damn, with all that money, coulda took the kids to school""
What I do? Built a school, so I can take 'em all to school
Now that's cruel, I got bored and blew 50 on the crew
But my homies, they ain't used to that, 'cause this is all new

'Cause if she follow me then she gon' probably swallow me
Yeah, they see me see a ticket, I'm a walking lottery
That's why I don't got no kids, fuck that baby mama beef

Came up from the dirt clean to a haters worst dream
But this brick house, this Stillhouse, I bet she thirsty
And I stacked 30 M's before I turned 30 (Yee)

At ten I used to want the Charizard, all holographic
Now I take some show money straight to Diamond District
I want the white and pink diamonds, listen, I'm specific
I woke up to all my dreams, listen, life's terrific
Look, I make more than the suits working Wall Street twice my age
It's a half a mil a night to make these PUMAs touch a stage
I'll send it to my lawyer, I won't even touch a page
Or just pay me in whiskey and I show up just to rage
Woke up at 2PM, I need a bagel and a coffee
Posted in Manhattan throwing supermodels off me
They sick of all the flexing, they say they want the old me
This don't get old that fast and I acclimated slowly
You're acting funny style, I can't fool with that
Rest in peace, Nipsey, wearing blue with that
I land private with the yadada, yeah, we flew with that
Just give me your girlfriend, bro you don't know what to do with that, come on

Uh, yeah
I just told myself, uh
Yeah, uh, yeah

[Chorus]
Welcome to LA
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away
The land of opportunity where everybody stay

[Verse 1]
Yeah
They move out to this town with dreams, ambitions, and get lost in the party
Takes a toll on you, man, this shit will charge a large fee
Just don't forget who you are, G
Staring at the man in the mirror, like I recognize him hardly
Burn my sins away and twist some parsley
Stop and chill, these days I do it sparsely
In another universe I coulda' had a stroller and a car seat, word
They tell me things will happen how they supposed to
But somehow it seems I hurt all the people I get close to
Experiencing breakdowns a 27 goes through
'Cause you don't want to see heaven yet, where Janis Joplin knows you
On phone calls with Mama like she tryin' to give me a earful
She said ""This is the town that happens in so just be careful
Been tryin' to keep your head straight
And dead-off all that bullshit, that's just dead weight""
Yeah
[Chorus]
Welcome to LA
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days
But I don't always feel that way, today I need some gray
Yeah, uh, please protect my soul before they weather it away
The land of opportunity where everybody stay

[Verse 2]
The whole world's outside knocking at my door like ""Gerald, where the fuck that album at?""
But I ain't home, I'm on the road, the stage is where they found me at
So my personal interests take a backseat to the business
But I balance like a gymnast, like Simone in the Olympics
So please pardon my tardiness, I'm tryin' to put my heart in this
Give this shit my everything, every time when I start with this
Hungry for the world, that’s why I starve for this
Yeah, artists come and go these days it's easy, they're not hard to miss
Here today, gone tomorrow, they fade into a dark abyss
Hollywood sold you a dream, like how the fuck you fall for this?
Have to know yourself or you just really gon' get lost in this, sauce
I really paid the cost to be a boss
I paid in cash and skipped the tax, ain't asked for no receipt
When I get stressed I play the beat and split a Swisher Sweet
Damn, yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Welcome to LA
The land of opportunity where everybody stay
The girls are pretty, the sun will shine 360 days

'Cause we'll never be just friends

And when I look around, I see you everywhere
I punched a hole in my wall and I just left it there
To remind me of that time I really took it there
And remind me not to start again 'cause nothing's there
'Cause if I call you that'll probably lead to somethin'
'Cause we'll probably meet to talk and then we'll probably end up fucking
We'll probably end up fighting, it's gon' be a lot of cussing
And shit can get disgusting and we're right back here at square one
And we can try be homies, but that shit ain't gon' work
Not trying to sell a dream to you, for what the fuck it's worth?
I did a lot of shit, I'm dying with my dirt
But, you still holding on, you still sleepin' in my shirt

Always wreck shit when you give me something I could crash
Patrick Bateman, American Psychopath
Murder you in cold blood shit is over with
I lose myself in my work it's how I cope with it
I find solace in a mansion whippin' foreigns
I don't know what's on the other side the door if I don't open it
But, yesterday you crossed my mind, then it hit me
You was down as fuck, did anything to benefit me
It's kinda fucked up, you never got to live it with me
I finally start soft and cross my mind with drinking whisky
Fucking alcohol, it's crazy we don't talk at all
I keep thinking 'bout reaching out to you to 'till I'm like knock it off
'Cause when I put the business first, I started poppin' off
But, if I kept it, then which way would I be better off?

I took some time off, it's time I start rappin' again
Don't wanna end up a ""Damn what happened to him?""
See my anxiety is kickin' in, I'm askin' a friend
""Am I losin' it?"" He said, ""No and don't ask me again""
I was broke two years ago, was I happier then?
Dreamin' 'bout the spot that right now, I'm actually in
Rushin' to the bank with checks that I'm cashin' to spend
But money can't buy you happiness, and that's just the thing
I know some people though that that could offend
Still strugglin', lookin' at me like, ""If I only lived as lavish as him...""
I wouldn't have to have this nine-to-five, yeah I'm alive
But it really ain't about survivin', fuck that, I'm tryna thrive
It's a difference, now take this for instance
I was at the bar the other week, had to wet my beak
This old drunk man next to me, I heard him speak
Talkin' loud like he tryna preach
He took two shots, don't do no chase
Then he said, ""If you're not living on the edge, you're taking too much space""
Thought about it, what you wish for isn't all that it seems
What if I just said, fuck it, never followed my dreams?
Never made me into a role model for all of these teens
My hero asked if we wonder what it all really means
If we'd ever really find our dreams, I'm still chasin' 'em
I still use these drugs, I'm still takin' 'em
I drink bottles in clubs, we still pay for them
I got plenty excuses, I'm still makin' em
I got flaws, I'm human, have faith in 'em
One day I'll find a girl who will wait for 'em
Yeah, guess I'm a constant work-in-progress
Especially with certain topics
As I navigate the road less traveled
Thread the needle, I just hope that I don't come unraveled
Yeah, and will I, will I follow up my last shit with a better one?
Will I go out as a legend when it's said and done?
Will they consider me a special one
Or just another rapper who had came and went?
But fuck it, at least I had a run
Dolo in the studio with candles lit
I close my eyes and imagine it
If you ain't in it, it's hard to fully understand this shit
The way the planet Earth is on my back but I can handle it
It's nothin'
Uh, you'd be surprised
You couldn't walk a mile in these Adidas Slides
Uh, you'd be surprised
If you could see this through my eyes

All day I keep drinking whiskey straight until I got no liver
Cold like (brr!), make you shiver
Snatching bitches, leave you bitter

Man I fuckin' love this life
Put it down and these hoes sayin' they love the pipe
No, I'm not the bring back to your mother type, no
Off that whiskey, 101 proof
I'm just mixing that with Vermouth
She'll be taken if you're aloof
We just fucked on top of that roof
This is real life, these ain't just no raps I kick in the booth
Every thing I say is the truth
Make her disappear just like poof
Then she's gone

Stay high all day

Say you love me, is that true?
Told her if it's that real get a tattoo
Maybe this bitch is who I come back to
Maybe this beat is too chill to rap to
Riding with Bonita smoking reefer
She ain't heard of you I ain't heard of you neither
Blowin' up gettin money and they hate it
No job so I'm chillin' gettin faded
Think I'm 'bout to go pick up a zippy I'm just -

Got a gypsy with me and we both gettin' trippy (trippy mane)
Bouta face a whole bot and then refill the roach quickly
Seal the zag with keef dust, and call that thing pixie
G got me feeling straight up, out the 50's
You would think our life is made up, it’s so damn nifty
And I'm lookin' extra spiffy tryin' to get lifty
Step up in the room they giddy throw it back and then we dippy
Been in love with weed since the first time I smelled it
Wanted it for free but karma wouldn't let me sell it
Got my first and only job just so I could afford it
But that didn't fit the schedule of skateboardin' and recordin'
Put my hours in now I got a job tourin'
Where we get free oz's when the land is foreign
(Thank you for that)
It's safe to say that we live that life
All these people keep sayin', ""Man it must be nice""

Clear visions with my eyes closed
Where I wanna take this to is where my mind goes
The road less traveled is the high road
I been knocked down, but every time I rose
'Cause I can move a mountain with my bare hands
Just need a fair chance, I never let 'em down
I never settled down, I came to get the crown
Avoided shortcuts, all I did was have a better sound
See all I did to make it, was stay extremely patient
I never been complacent, I never did  get jaded
I lived inside my studio, the room was never vacant
I'm unparalleled, I'm sorry, we are not adjacent
It's just the way I am, just gotta make a plan
I think of what I want and get it, every day I am
Chasin' dreams but never sleep, see how awake I am?
How you gon' win if you never try to take a chance?

Lookin' for revenge, I been workin' all Summer long
They know what I came for, now why would I change for it
If I ain't doin' it right, then what the critics singin' praise for?
This is what I trained for, what the people pay for
Music got realer, started channelin' my pain more
Greats are the only ones I ever try to aim for
Ready to convince all of you haters if you ain't sure
Make no mistake about it, there's nothin' fake about it
You say I'll be at the event, well then, it may get crowded
You think I'm ever givin' up? For Pete's sake, I doubt it
I'm in my element tonight and you can't take me out it
And I said, fuck a comfort zone and started breakin' out it
This music's keepin' me alive, I swear I ache without it

And every night we sequel

Say you do?

It's, four in the morning I'm looking for drugs
Already faded increasing my buzz
Working it off I'll be at the clubs
Every weekend this is what I does
I know that you think that you party like us in a similar fashion
But I spent a rack on these jeans that I'm holding my stash in
Snatching your hoes then I'm smashin'
I'm higher than you can imagine
Pray that I don't see no polices flashin'

Rolling up sticky

Meanwhile your dealer is selling you bullshit stepping all on it like rugs

All my life for this
They told me, I won't make it
But I made it

It's tough not to get anxious
Exercising my patience
I thought it never would happen
I swear I waited for ages
Had faith in the journey
I said, ""let's see where it takes us""
We want gratification
But see it happens in stages
With a team on my back
A couple times might have cracked
But never broke and I can hold them in fact
Man, you know how much weight was on him?
Must have came from within'
My lanky ass don't even go to the gym
My album in, just one, but twenty mixtapes to my name
A lot of y'all would lose your appetites
With a distaste for the game
Lot of y'all would call it quits
Because you just chase for the fame
Tell my story to inspire you
Just in case you're the same
Self-made, now I employ ten of my friends
Tryna move moms out the Honda
Tryna send her a Benz
Appreciate it all 'cause it's no telling when this shit ends
Unless this is all a dream and then it depends

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
Listen, yeah, and all we ever wanted was chances
Dreams of life changing, checks from label advances
Copping mansions
The kind of conversations marijuana enhances
Back then I let them know what my plans is
A poet in sixteen bar stanzas
Sixteen with dreams so far fetched no one understands us
Playing shows in stadiums
Where everybody way up in the stands is
Standing on their feet, I paint the picture on canvas
That I seen, in my dreams in quick visions and glances
Woke up in NYC today, don't think we're in Kansas
Anymore, but sometimes it's hard to be sure
'Cause if I dreamed that it happened, did it actually or?
Am I just still asleep, and none of it's real
Wake up tomorrow right back in the struggle
Tryna come up and build
I don't know this shit gets deep and ignorance is bliss
It's all I've ever loved, I waited my whole life for this, yeah

Oh I don't know where I'm gonna go
All I really know, is I want you to come with me
And fuck with me, I want you with me
I ain't going home without you, yeah I need you with me
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now

[Post-Hook]
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
Do you wanna go?
Are you down or you not?
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
I ain't listening to no one
I'm just drowning them out

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Bout to dip, are you coming with me?
People staring like it's something to see
Come jump in the sea, you come fuck with me
Yeah it ain't gotta be no extra shit, we rush it to be
But I can show you things you probably not accustomed to see
My ex is tripping, what else is new? Yeah that's just a selfish view
Same issues that I'm not tryna help her through
Behaviors always jealous like, fuck you expect me to do?
Texting at two, I only got this one question for you
Let's go somewhere and find something to do
Know I'm impatient, but I just want you
Cause I can't see tonight ending at two
I know I'm faded, but so are you too
[Hook]
Oh I don't know where I'm gonna go
All I really know is I want you to come with me
And fuck with me, I want you with me
I ain't going home without you, yeah I need you with me
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now

[Post-Hook]
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
Do you wanna go?
Are you down or you not?
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
I ain't listening to no one
I'm just drowning them out

[Verse 2]
How much time I be spending to chase
I be chilling, I'm not sprinting a race
I mean, of course, she knowing less in the case
She had it all, I mean, a ten in the face
Could tell from clothes to drugs she had the most expensivest taste
Both designer, I hope I find her, let's get higher than higher
I see her, I eye her, like nothing in this world matters prior
Listen, y'all chasing chicks, I'm asking why like I'm Jadakiss
Accept her naked pics make other girls look the basicest, so
I know this isn't your usual form
Just play it safe, try avoiding the storm
I know it's cold but that whiskey is warm
I don't know what to do right now, listen, I'm torn
[Hook]
Oh I don't know where I'm gonna go
All I really know is I want you to come with me
And fuck with me, I want you with me
I ain't going home without you, yeah I need you with me
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now
Yeah I need you now, yeah I need you now

[Post-Hook]
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?
Do you wanna go?
Are you down or you not?
I just wanna know
Are you down or you not?

Now how you measurin'
Talent or who's better than
Shit, I made it here with the team on my back no letterman
Tour like I'm a veteran
Cali to the Netherlands
But he's an average joe, they say he'll never win
White rapper with a cheesy name
Thinkin' he might find easy fame (false)
Haters please refrain
Look at all these fans you've seen me gain
Real recognizes real
Maybe that's why you can't see it
Put your readin' glasses on
High up and I'm passin' strong
I engineer my sessions
I can probably teach you lessons
There's so much more than meets the eye upon your first impressions
See, I work hard but don't we all
I rip shows? but don't we all or do we
Rappers say a lot but boy I, boy I really ball
Traded in my social life for pro tools and a mac
Staying in of Friday night's laying vocals on my tracks
Swear in never use to party, I was focused on the plaque
Thought I fade away and quit, you fools I told you I'd be back
I be in the lab like dexter and your as fake as polyester
Through it all I stuck with school, bout to start my last semester
So, can't tell me what it is to grind
Did my thang and I took my time
Class of my own boy I'm so stoned
Im high as Diddy's credit line
Why would I stand where I don't fit in
Why would I rap if I ain't shitin'
Why would chick keep lookin' at me
When its clear to see that she came with him
Shoot for the starts and I aim to win
Smokin' good and drinkin' gin
Girls get loose, poor a lil juice
Party all night till it hit AM
Yeah, yeah, I'm on my way
Why would I trip off what they say
Hit the stage for 30 minutes get off and get twice their pay
Damn and that some real shit you should think about it
If you took the time to listen instead of doubtin' you'd be bout it
See, regardless of what they speak
They can talk ill turn my cheek
Givin' up and walkin' home and calling it a day is super weak
I keep going I'm runnin' on E
Rapcast really got nothin' on me
Check this out what you don't see
For a minute I've been killin' this shit low-key
Labels try to fly me out
Buy me sushi sit me down
But I don't fit in with the mainstream
So that's why I mean we can't be down
Sorry fools but I refuse to simply compromise my sound
Ill be up on me indy shit
You see my bro ill be around
Give my music all away
And then I tour away for what I got in store
I'm a young entrepreneur
See every time I worry
Or feel a bit unsure
I hit the stage and look around and feel so reassured19Embed"

Yeah (It's time for the ninety-nine)
Ayy, yeah

[Chorus]
One of one, ain't no one like me
One of one, ain't no one like you
Yeah, we the shit together
Let's go around the world hittin' licks together, yeah
One of one ain't no one like us
Why the fuck you think they don't like us?
Ay, we the shit together
Let's go around the world hittin' licks together (Uh)

[Verse 1]
You my bitch forever
I wanna mob with you, hittin' licks together
Through thick and thin we stick together
Let's run a threesome, hit a bitch together, yeah
But honestly, we're enough together
Let's move to Paris and be rich forever
Then maybe go half on some kids together
Settle down in Florence, baby, it's whatever, yeah
Wintertime we can switch the furs
40K a piece, cop his and hers
Vicuña plus got the Birkin purse
Scenic route in the 'Rari while the engine purrs
[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, you make the boy calm down
I just want to hear you sing this song out loud
Uh, and she loyal to the core
I'm worried about her, I ain't worried 'bout yours

[Chorus]
One of one, ain't no one like me
One of one, ain't no one like you
Yeah, we the shit together

Ay, we the shit together
Let's go around the world hittin' licks together

[Verse 2]
Bonnie and Clyde, no reason to switch
Ready to die, it's just me and my bitch
We out to Dubai when the seasons switch
Left some girls in the past, I ain't seen 'em since
Call from the plane as it takes off for you
Came to see you, took some days off for you
One life to live, I would die for you
Whatever you ask, you know I would supply for you
Rolex, Chanel clutch I buy for you
Cartier nail bracelet 'cause I adore you
Answer whenever you call, I won't ignore you
2000 roses Venus ET Fleur, yeah, I'll spoil you
[Pre-Chorus]
Uh, you make the boy calm down
I just want to hear you sing this song out loud
Yeah, and she loyal to the core
Worried about her, I ain't worried 'bout yours

One of one, ain't no one like me
One of one, ain't no one like you
Yeah, we the shit together
