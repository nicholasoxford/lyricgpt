You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still don’t know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Oh (Thanks for warning me)
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over
Holy Grail
[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Uh, uh, uh
Blue told me remind you niggas, uh
Fuck that shit y'all talkin' 'bout, I'm the nigga, uh
Caught up in all these lights and cameras, uh
But look what that shit did to Hammer, uh
Goddamn it, I like it
Bright lights is enticin'
But look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night
Thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all that money blows
All the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheatin' on me
What I do? I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad
I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma, please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame
Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself, uh
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake & JAY-Z]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid and contagious
No, we all just entertainers

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day, you're screamin' you love me loud
The next day, you're so cold
One day, you're here, one day, you're there
One day, you care, you're so unfair
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now I got tattoos on my body
Psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper
Photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk
See 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off
Enough is enough, I'm callin' this off
Who the fuck I'm kiddin' though?
I'm gettin' high, sittin' low
Slidin' by in that big body
Curtains all in my window
This fame hurt, but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga, deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snappin', my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggas die for, dry yours
Why you mad? Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water
[Pre-Chorus: JAY-Z]
You still alive, still that nigga
Nigga, you survived, you still gettin' bigger
Nigga, living the life, vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigga alive; Michael Jackson's Thriller

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Jay-Z]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you

The next day, you're so cold (Uh, uh, uh)

One day, you care (Uh), you're so unfair (Uh, uh)
Sippin' from your cup 'til it runneth over

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart
Just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don't know why (Don't know why)
Why I love you so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve
Forever in ink with guess whose name?
But I still don't know why
Why our love is so much (Thanks for warning me)
Yeah (Thanks for warning me)
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Jay-Z]
And, baby, it's amazin' I'm in this maze with you (Uh, uh, uh, uh)

Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
An innocent love I'm misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces, chugging D'USSÉ, ugh
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
Why

[Bridge: Beyoncé]
I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
[Hook: Beyoncé]
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tats, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Ugh
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'ma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming

They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

[Beyoncé]
I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem–hola, my Dominicanos (Dimelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say what up to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out, I could trip a referee
Tell by my attitude that I'm most definitely from

Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
So they can step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse – don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami, took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA got you feelin' like a champion
The city never sleeps, better slip you a Ambien

I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be

That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood

Few years later, that shit worth eight million

Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; ""What if—""
""You over my shit?""

[Chorus: Kim Burrell]
I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

[Chorus]
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
[Verse 1]
I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward.""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads
Fuckers, I don't know what you take me as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay Z has
I'm from rags to riches, niggas, I ain't dumb
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Verse 2]
The year is '94, in my trunk is raw
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin' law
Got two choices, y'all: pull over the car or
Bounce on the devil, put the pedal to the floor
And I ain't tryin' to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
‘Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low?
Do I look like a mind reader, sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some more?
""Well, you was doing 55 in a 54
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are.""
I ain't steppin' out of shit, all my paper's legit
""Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?""
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
""Aren't you sharp as a tack?
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?""
Well, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
""Well, we'll see how smart you are when the K9 come!""
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one

[Verse 3]
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of havin' a pussy
But a pussy havin' no goddamn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin'
And he and his boys gonna be yappin' to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratchin' again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin' em
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mil' for bail ‘cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassin' them
Tryin' to play the boy like he's saccharine
But ain't nothin' sweet 'bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems, bein' a bitch ain't one – hit me!
[Chorus]
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one – hit me!

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
'Cause here we go, he's Jigga-Jur-Jigga-Jih-Jigga
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a

I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lotta lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lotta innocent lives lost on the project bench
What you hollerin'? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin' braver
Durag wrappin' my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me
I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan, my pops left me
And often my mama wasn't home
Could not stress to me, I wasn't grown
'Specially on nights I brought somethin' home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin' green up
Raisin' my fingers to critics, raisin' my head to the sky
Big, I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
[Verse 4: Eminem]
See, I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the king of these Latter-day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
A monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see, it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape?
Media scapegoat who they can be mad at today
See, it's as easy as cake, simple as whistlin' ""Dixie""
While I'm wavin' the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfuckin' spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do? (Huh?), I'm just a kid from the gutter
Makin' his butter off these bloodsuckers, 'cause I'm a motherfuckin'

You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him twenty million without blinkin'
He gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say

Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up!
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 2: Jay Z]
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
You can call me Caesar, in a dark Caesar
Please follow the leader, so Eric B we are
Microphone fiend, this the return of the God
Peace, God, ah ah, it ain't no nobody fresher
I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin'
""Fuck the other side! They're jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads
They got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in
‘Cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like millionaires' row
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Life’s a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don’t care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory’s within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who’s gon' run this town tonight
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy
Who’s gon' run this town tonight?

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life goodwill hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels.""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels.""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel

Whassup!
Heyyy, heyy, heyyy, heyy

[Jay-Z]
This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records
[Just Blaze]
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, OH, H-to-the-O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov!
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, OH—not D.O.C
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do it Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude
With the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors (*laughing*)
This ain't a movie, dog (oh shit)
[Interlude: Just Blaze]
Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you. Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!
And I don't care WHAT you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you JACK!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""by any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone
Now, back to our regularly scheduled program, L'Album Noir: The Black Album52Embed"

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
‘Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em lookin' good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezin'
Talkin' about, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word
Bitch, better trust and believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm pickin' them up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga's fists in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head
I'ma break bread, so you can be livin' it up?
Shit, I part with nothin', y'all be frontin'
Me give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothin', never happen; I'll be forever mackin'
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience and I hate waitin'
Ho, get your ass in and let's ride!
Check em out now, ride!
Ride!
Check em out now, ride!

We doin' big pimpin', we spendin' cheese
Check 'em out now, big pimpin' on B-L-A-D’s

Comin' straight up out the black barrio
Makes a mill' up off a sorry ho
Then sit back and peep my sce-nahr-i-o
Oops, my bad, that's ""my scenario""
No, I can't fuck a scary ho
Now every time, every place, everywhere we go
Hoes start pointin', they say: ""There he go!""
Now these motherfuckers know we carry mo'
Heat than a little bit
We don't pull it out over little shit
And if you catch a lick when I spit
Then it won't be a little hit
Go read a book, you illiterate son of a bitch!
And step up your vocab!
Don't be surprised if your ho stab out with me
And you see us comin' down on yo' SLAB
Livin' ghetto-fabulous, so mad, you just can't take it
But nigga if you hatin' I
Then you wait while I get your bitch butt-naked
Just break it; you gotta pay like you weigh
Wet with two pairs of clothes on
Now get yo' ass to the back as I'm flyin' to the track
Timbaland, let me spit my prose on
Pump it up in the pro-zone
That's the track that we breakin' these hoes on
Ain't the track that we flows on
But when shit get hot then the Glock start poppin' like ozone
We keep hoes crunk like Trigger-man
For real, it don't get no bigger, man
Don't trip, let's flip, gettin' throwed on the flip
Gettin' blowed with the motherfuckin' Jigga Man, fool!

All my car got leather and wood
In my hood we call it ""buck""
Everybody wanna ball
Holla at broads at the mall
If he up, watch him fall
Nigga, I can't fuck with y'all
If I wasn't rappin', baby
I would still be ridin' Mercedes
Comin' down and sippin' daily
No record 'til whitey pay me
Uhh, now what y'all know about them Texas boys?
Comin' down in candied toys
Smokin' weed and talkin' noise

On the canopy, my stamina be
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee

Made my money quick, then back to the streets
But still sittin' on blades, sippin' that Ray
Standin' on the corner of my block, hustlin'
Still gettin' that 'caine
Half what I paid slippin' right through customs
It'll sell by night, its egg shell white
I got so many grams, if the man find out
It will land me in jail for life
But I'm still big pimpin', spendin' cheese
With Bun B, Pimp C, and Timothy
We got bitches in the back of the truck
Laughin' it up, Jigga Man: that's what's up!

Ladies and gentlemen
Goddammit
Let this shit knock

[Verse 1]
I done turned Havana to Atlanta
Guayabera shirts and bandanas
Every time you think they got me I switch the planner
Bulletproof this, radio scanners
(You got scanners, we got scanners)
Balling 'til they ban us
You getting too much bread, they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Politicians never did shit for me
Except lie to me, distort history
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt
Obama said ""Chill, you gonna get me impeached""
But you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach
[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Y'all gon' learn today

[Verse 2]
Uh, y'all must want to start a revolution
You know whenever I'm threatened, I start shooting (Bang!)
Catch a body, head to Houston
I'm in Cuba, I love Cubans
This communist talk is so confusing
When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music
You're an idiot, baby, you should become a student
Oh, you gonna learn today
Where the fuck have you been

The new role model, fuck this Zoolander shit

Picture all the possibilities
Sounds like a love song
Sounds like a love song
The most incredible, baby
Uh
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Yeah, yeah
Uh
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 1]
Good dude, I know you love me like cooked food
Even though a nigga gotta move like a crook move
We was together on the block since free lunch
We shoulda been together havin' Four Seasons brunch
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather
So now we travel first-class to change the forecast
Never in bunches, just me and you
I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, a nigga so sick
[Chorus]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry, uh
Can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

[Verse 2]
On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you
[Chorus]
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

[Verse 3]
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
[Chorus]
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now

Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate

I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America likes me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile
[Outro: Gloria Carter]
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

These are verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a motherfuckin' prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice

I had luggage, meaning I had baggage

Fuck all this pretty Shawn Carter shit nigga, HOV

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Shawn was on that gospel shit
I was on the total fuckin' opposite
Shit, stuff a million dollars in the sock drawer
That's a war chest in case you need your chest knocked off
Y'all be talkin' crazy under them IG pictures
So when you get to hell you tell 'em Blanco sent ya
I can't take no threats, I got a set of twins (Ah)
Those were just some words you'll never hear again (Uh huh)
For the final time you don't believe these fools
I've never seen a worker rock so many jewels (Never)
I've never seen the runner with so many cars (Never)
Y'all couldn't stop me, you're not as tough as you say you are
My advice is just don't be too nice to niggas
Just set the price so niggas'll live your life, my nigga
Once upon a time in the projects
Shawn was in flight mode, I bought a Pyrex
I was in fight mode and now it's ""Fuck me, mijo""
I was movin' them kilos, help you move your peoples
Sometimes you need your ego, gotta remind these fools
Who they effin' with, and we got FN's too
Before we had A&R's, we had AR's too
We the only ones really movin' like y'all say y'all do
We still movin' like y'all niggas say y'all did
Emory passed you niggas and he did a bid
Ty Ty jumped over niggas and he's like 5'6""
Got the heart of a giant, don't you ever forget
Don't you never forget, Jigga got this shit poppin'
I pulled out the pot when we was outta options
[Chorus: Damian Marley and JAY-Z]

Put that drum in your ear, don't get Srem'd

Niggas could not be further, I fathered your style
Birth of a Nation, Nat Turner style
Uh, y'all make me turn up all this talkin' down
Uh, niggas is skippin' leg-day just to run they mouth
I be skippin' leg day, I still run the world
I pressed ahead of your team with one finger curled
I'll line you all up with one finger wave
Make niggas weave, niggas is out here fake
Laced front to the back, don't front
Y'all gonna make me wig, I'ma give y'all what you want, uh

You ready, B?
Let's go get 'em

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Look for me!
Young, B, cruisin' down the Westside Highway
Doin' what we like to do, our way
Eyes behind shades
This necklace the reason all of my dates been blind dates
But today I got my thoroughest girl with me
I'm mashin' the gas, she's grabbin' the wheel, it's trippy
How hard she rides with me, the new Bobby and Whitney
Only time we don't speak is during Sex and the City
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show's over
She's right back to being my soldier
‘Cause mami's a rider and I'm a roller
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?
Whatever she lacks I'm right over her shoulder
When I'm off track, mami is keepin' me focused
So let's lock this down like it's supposed to be
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde: Hov' and B holla

[Hook: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
[Verse 2: Jay Z]
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin'
With the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin'
That ain't 'bout nothin'
If ever you mad about somethin'
It won't be that, oh no, it won't be that
I don't be at places where we comfy at
With no be-atch, oh no, you won't see that
And no, I ain't perfect
Nobody walkin' this earth's surface is
But girlfriend, work with the kid
I keep you workin' that Hermès Birkin bag
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, Aviator lens
600 drops, hercedes Benz
The only time you wear Burberry to swim
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him
She do anything necessary for him
And I do anything necessary for her
So don't let the necessary occur, yep!

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
All I need in this life of sin is me and my girlfriend (me and my girlfriend)
Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)
[Verse 3: Beyoncé (and Jay-Z)]
(Talk to 'em, B!) If I was your girlfriend
I'll be there for you, if somebody hurts you
Even if that somebody was me (That’s right!)
Yeah-hee (Break it down for 'em, B!)
Sometimes I trip on how happy we could be
And so I put this on my life
Nobody or nothing will ever come between us
And I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend (One more time!)
Put this on my life
The air that I breathe in, all that I believe in
I promise I'll give my life
My love and my trust if you was my boyfriend

[Chorus: Jay Z and Beyoncé]

Ladies and gentlemen, let's put our hands together for this dynasty
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen
To the eighth wonder of the world
The flow of the century
Always timeless
Hov
Thanks for coming out tonight
You could've been anywhere in the world
But you're here with me
I appreciate that
Uh

[Verse 1]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
Was herbing 'em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese, I would work with them
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
Haters want me clapped in chrome, it ain't easy
Cops want to knock me, D.A. wants to box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me
Is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist
So poof, vamoose, son of a bitch
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A

Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up (Holla at me)

[Verse 2]
I do this for my culture, to let 'em know
What a nigga look like when a nigga in a roaster
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures
Industry shady, it need to be taken over
Label owners hate me, I'm raisin' the status quo up
I'm overcharging niggas for what they did to the Cold Crush
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us
We can talk, but money talks, so talk more bucks
[Chorus]
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA

Not guilty, y'all got to feel me
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
That's the anthem, getcha damn hands up
[Verse 3]
Yeah, Hov is back, life stories told through rap
Niggas acting like I sold you crack (Yeah)
Like I told you sell drugs, no, Hov did that
So hopefully you won't have to go through that
I was raised in the projects, roaches and rats
Smokers out back sellin' they mama's sofa
Lookouts on the corner focused on the ave
Ladies in the window focused on the kinfolk
Me under a lamppost, why I got my hand closed?
Crack's in my palm, watching the long arm of the law
So you know I seen it all before
I've seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight
To try and to fail, the two things I hate
Succeed and this rap game, the two things that's great
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
What else can I say about dude? I gets busy

You ain't gotta count it my nigga I can add

We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man

Do you really want to live forever, forever, and ever? (Uh)

Where the sun is always out and you never get old
And the champagne's always cold and the music's always good
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty ass car
Without a wrinkle in today, 'cause there's no tomorrow
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time

Are not for legends, I'm forever young, my name shall survive
Through the darkest blocks, over kitchen stoves, over Pyrex pots
My name shall be passed down to generations
While debating up in barbershops
Young slung, hung here, showed that a nigga from here
With a little ambition, just what we can become here (yeah)
And as the father pass the story down to his son's ears

[Verse 1]
This shit is wicked on these mean streets
None of my friends speak, we're all tryna win
But then again, maybe it's for the best though
'Cause when they're sayin' too much
You know they're tryna get you touched
Whoever said illegal was the easy way out
Couldn't understand the mechanics
And the workings of the underworld, granted
Nine-to-five is how you survive, I ain't tryna survive
I'm tryna live it to the limit and love it a lot
Life ills poisoned my body, I used to say fuck mic skills
I never prayed to God, I prayed to Gotti
That's right, it's wicked – that's life, I live it
Ain't askin' for forgiveness for my sins, ends
I break bread with the late heads
Pickin' their brains for angles on all the evils that the game'll do
It gets dangerous, money and power is changin' us
And now we're lethal, infected with D'evils

But grew apart as the money grew and soon grew black-hearted
Thinkin' back when we first learned to use rubbers
He never learned, so in turn I'm kidnappin' his baby's mother
My hand around her collar, feedin' her cheese
She said the taste of dollars was shitty, so I fed her fifties
About his whereabouts I wasn't convinced
I kept feedin' her money 'til her shit started to make sense
Who could ever foresee?
We used to stay up all night at slumber parties
Now I'm tryna rock his bitch to sleep
All the years we were real close
Now I see his fears through her tears
Know she's wishin' we were still close
Don't cry, it is to be; in time

Was thought to be a pleasant guy all my fuckin' life
So now I'm down for whatever, ain't nothin' nice
Throughout my junior high years it was all friendly
But now this higher learning got the Remy in me
Liquor's invaded my kidneys
Got me ready to lick off – Momma, forgive me

Got me runnin' with guys, makin' G's, tellin' lies that sound true
Come test me, I never cower

[Intro]
Take the bass line out
Uh-huh, Jigga
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah
Let it bump though

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 1]
From standin' on the corners, boppin'
To drivin' some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen
From droppin' some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock
Fleein' the murder scene, you know me well
From nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell
But since when y'all niggas know me to fail? Fuck naw
Where all my niggas with the rubber grips, bust shots
And if you with me, mama, rub on your tits, and what-not
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, you must not
Let outsiders violate our blocks and my plot
Let's stick up the world and split it 50/50, uh-huh
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!
You know it's hell when I come through
The life and times of Shawn Carter, nigga, Volume 2
Y'all niggas get ready!
[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 2]
I flow for those 'dro'ed out
All my niggas locked down in the 10 by four, controllin' the house
We live in hard knocks
We don't take over, we borrow blocks
Burn 'em down and you can have it back
Daddy, I'd rather that
I flow for chicks wishin', they ain't have to strip to pay tuition
I see your vision, mama
I put my money on the longshots
All my ballers that's born to clock
Know I'ma be on top whether I perform or not
I went from lukewarm to hot
Sleepin' on futons and cots to King Size
Green machines, to green 5's
I've seen pies, let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills
Then I put it down type Braille
I'm tight grill with the phony
Rappers, y'all might feel we homies
I'm like, ""Still, y'all don't know me.""
Shit, I'm tight grill when my situation ain't improvin'
I'm tryna murder everything movin' – feel me?
[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!

[Verse 3]
I don't know how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes
Got a lotta beef, so logically, I prey on my foes
Hustlin' is still inside of me, and as far as progress
You'd be hard-pressed to find another rapper hot as me
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out
Didn't really appreciate it 'til the second one came out
So I stretched the game out, etched your name out
Put Jigga on top and dropped albums non-stop for ya, nigga!

[Chorus]
It's the hard knock life for us
It's the hard knock life for us
Instead of treated, we get tricked
Instead of kisses, we get kicked
It's the hard knock life!61Embed"

After the projects, now we on estates

Fuck up the world
Just fuck up this world
Fuck up the world

[Verse 1]
Me and destiny got a date
Martin had a dream, Hov got a team
My chain already heavy, don't let me get a ring
Parades down Flatbush, confetti on my fur
Turn right in Rutland, niggas heavy on the curb
See most my niggas died early twenties or late teens
I'm just trying to come from under the thumb of this regime
1% of a billion more than niggas even seen
Still they wanna act like it's an everyday thing, clean
[Hook]
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up this world
Fuck up the, uhh

[Verse 2]
High Yellow sky dweller and the rose gold
Legend of the summer in the Rose Bowl
Came through Pasadena in the low-low
Just to show respect to the cholos
Feelin' like a stranger in my own land
Got me feeling like Brody in Homeland
I just want a shot to show my genius
Standing on the top hold my penis
America tried to emasculate the greats
Murdered Malcolm, gave Cassius the shakes
Wait, tell them rumble young man rumble
Try to dim your lights tell you be humble
You know I'm gon' shine like a trillion watts
You know a nigga trill as Michael Jackson socks
Sendin' light out to Compton and the hundred blocks
Lil bastard boy, basking on top

[Hook]
I fuck up this world
Just fuck up this world
Let's fuck up the world
Fuck up the, uhh
[Verse 3]
Sipping D'USSÉ boy this ain't your daddy yak
He in a Cadillac; me? I'm in the Maybach
This ain't grey sweat suits and white tube socks
This is black leather pants and a pair of Stance
Socks is my synopsis is clear
Got strip clubs feeling like Oxford, I swear
Teacher-teacher, I'm trying to unteach ya
All the shit they taught y'all, they got you all in the bleachers
When you front row at the Knicks game, those the Spike Lees
You front row everywhere, you in the H.O.V.'s
Jordan 1's and dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Make a million another million let my niggas make a million
'til we all check a billion, shit it's just the way I'm feeling
We have yet to see a ceiling, we just top what we top
Cause the bars don't struggle when the struggle don't stop

[Intro]
Yeah, hah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella
We invite you to somethin' epic, you know?
Well, we hustle out of a sense of hopelessness
Sort of a desperation
Through that desperation, we become addicted
Sort of like the fiends we accustomed to servin'
But we feel we have nothin' to lose
So, we offer you, well, we offer our lives, right?
What do you bring to the table?
[Verse 1]
While I'm watchin' every nigga watchin' me closely
My shit is butter for the bread, they wanna toast me
I keep my head, both of them, where they supposed to be
Hoes'll get you sidetracked, then clapped from close feet
I don't sleep, I'm tired, I feel wired like codeine, these days
A brother gotta admire me from four fiends away
My pain, wish it was quick to see
From sellin' 'caine 'til brains was fried to a fricassee
Can't lie, at the time it never bothered me
At the bar, gettin' my thug on properly
My squad and me lack of respect for authority
Laughin' hard, happy to be escapin' poverty, however brief
I know this game got valleys and peaks
Expectation for dips, for precipitation we stack chips, hardly
The youth I used to be, soon to see a mill'in
No more Big Willie, my game has grown
Prefer you call me William
Illin' for revenues, Rayful Edmond-like
Channel 7 News, round seven jewels, head dead in the mic
Forgettin' all I ever knew, convenient amnesia
""I suggest you call my lawyer, I know the procedure.""
Lock my body, can't trap my mind
Easily explain why we adapt to crime
I'd rather die enormous than live dormant, that's how we on it
Live at the main event, I bet a trip to Maui on it
Presidential suites my residential for the weekend
Confidentially speakin' in codes since I sense you peekin'
The NSX rental, don't be fooled, my game is mental
We both out of town, dog, what you tryin' to get into?
Viva Las Vegas, see ya later at the crap tables
Meet me by the one that starts a G up
This way no Fraud Willies present gamblin' they re-up
And we can have a pleasant time, sippin' margaritas
[Chorus]
Ge-ge-geyeahhh
Can I live?
Can I live?
[Verse 2]
My mind is infested with sick thoughts that circle
Like a Lexus, if driven wrong it's sure to hurt you
Dual level like duplexes, in unity
My crew and me commit atrocities like we got immunity
You guessed it, manifest it
In tangible goods, platinum Rolex'd it
We don't lease, we buy the whole car, as you should
My confederation, dead a nation
Explode on detonation, overload the mind of a said patient
When it boils to steam, it comes to it
We all fiends, gotta do it: even righteous minds go through this
True this, the streets school us to spend our money foolish
Bond with jewelers and watch for intruders
I stepped it up another level, meditated like a Buddhist
Recruited lieutenants with ludicrous dreams of gettin' cream
""Let's do this,"" it gets tedious
So I keep one eye open like CBS — you see me stressed, right?

Can I live?
Can I live?
Can I live?

Kanyeezy you did it again, you a genius, nigga!

[Chorus]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder them first
Emergency, doctors performing procedures
Jesus, I ain't trying to be facetious, but
""Vengeance is mine"" sayeth the Lord, you said it better than all
Leave niggas on death's door, breathing on
Respirators for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan
Pumping ""Brown Sugar"" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature, ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithe, being good Catholics, I'm coming
[Chorus]
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, son of the morning! I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(So you need to change your attitude 'fore they asking what happened to you)

[Verse 2]
Yes, this is holy war, I wet y'all all with the holy water
Spray from the Heckler-Koch automatic
All the static, shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!
Spread love, to all of my dead thugs
I pour out a little Louis, 'till I head above
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the Earth
'til that time, it's on and popping, church
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral for stunting like Evel Knievel
I let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk, the more you irking us
The more you gon' need memorial services
The Black Album, second verse, is like
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us

[Interlude]
Man, I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy 'til somebody die
Oh man, I gotta get my soul right
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
I chase you off of this Earth
(Let me get serious for y'all, one second)
[Verse 3]
I got dreams of holding a nine milla to Bob's killer
Asking him ""why?"" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel ya
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass, reverse the crash
Reverse the blast then reverse the car
Reverse the day and there you are, Bobalob
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning, thanks again36Embed"

And Jam Master Jay was alive I-I, I was mixin'
Cookin' coke in the kitchen
Back when Rodman was a Piston
Mike was losin' to Isiah, but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination
Assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from Hamlet
""Lord, we know who we are
Yet we know not what we may be""
So maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from Marcy Houses, where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on Martin
Yeah, that's where it all started
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a… nine millimeter
When Slick Rick made ""Mona Lisa""
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day, I had divas, y'all
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah

I'm the Gotham City heartbeat

I'ma, Sufi to goofies, I could prolly speak Farsi
That's poetry, reek of coca leaf in my past
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses
I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shit feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe, I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof, uh
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke
Y'all flirtin' with death, I be winkin' through the scope
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals

Shout out to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle
All the County of Kings, may your ground stay fertile
Shout out to Big Poppa, Daddy Kane, heroes
Thus concludin' my concerto

Your mama said that you danced for her
Did you wiggle your hands for her?

Hard not to spoil you rotten, looking like little me
The most beautifulest thing in this world
Is daddy's little girl
You don't yet know what swag is but you was made in Paris
And Mama woke up the next day and shot her album package
Last time the miscarriage was so tragic
We was afraid you'd disappear, but nah, baby, you magic (Voilà!)
So there you have it, shit happens
Just make sure the plane you on is bigger than your carry-on baggage
Everybody go through stuff
Life is a gift, love, open it up
You're a child of destiny
You're the child of my destiny
You're my child with the child from Destiny's Child
That's a hell of a recipe

Ahh, who wanna bet us that we don't touch lettuce?
Stack cheddars forever, live treacherous, all the et ceteras
To the death of us, me and my confidants, we shine
You feel the ambiance, y'all niggas just rhyme
By the ounce, dough accumulates like snow
We don't just shine, we illuminate the whole show, you feel me?
Factions from the other side would love to kill me
Spill three quarts of my blood into the street, let alone the heat
Fuck 'em, they hate a nigga lovin' his life
In all possible ways, know the Feds is buggin' my life
Hospital days, reflectin' when my man laid up
On the uptown high block, he got his side sprayed up
I saw his life slippin', this is a minor setback
Yo, still in all we livin', just dream about the get-back
That made him smile, though his eyes said ""pray for me""
I'll do you one better and slay these niggas faithfully
Murder is a tough thing to digest, it's a slow process
And I ain't got nothin' but time
I had near brushes, not to mention
Three shots, close range, never touched me, divine intervention
Can't stop I, from drinkin' Mai-Tai's, with Ty-Ty

I gross the most at the end of the fiscal year than these niggas can wish to
The dead presidential candidate
With the sprinkles and the Presidential, ice that'll offend you
In due time when crime flees my mind
All sneak thieves and player haters can shine
But until then, I keep the trilliant cut diamonds shinin' brilliant
I'll tell you half the story; the rest, you fill it in
Long as the villain win
I spend Japan yen, attend major events
Catch me in the joints, convinced my iguanas is bitin'

'Nough dollars make sense, while you ride the bench

He told me his wishes before he died
Now, Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy has ""Slave"" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't ""big bro"" me, don't ""Big Homie""
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful
[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Ready for it, deep breath, fill up the void
Eyes, open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams

[Post-Chorus: Frank Ocean]
I've been out of touch for a couple years
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I can touch what I see
'Cause I've been ready for you, for real

[Break]
Look, you've done enough
Have you no sense of decency, sir?
At long last, have you left no sense of decency?

“I work and work 'til I'm half-dead and I hear people saying
""She's getting old,"" and what do I get? A daughter
Who cares as much about the beautiful dresses I give her
As she cares about ME!”

[Verse 1]
Let's do this for these babies
Mercedes truck, fuck, houses on acres
Blatantly ballin' on HD
Y'all need to step up y'all AV
Life changed again I was already taking off
My flight changed again
Slight change of winds
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again
Baby need Pampers
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons
Please don't judge me, only hugged the block
I thought my daddy didn't love me
My baby getting chubby
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww, isn't she lovely?
Now I'm staring at her praying that things don't get ugly
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby
Fuck joint custody, I need a joint right now
Just the thought alone fucks with me
[Hook]
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest

[Interlude]
""Don't fuck with me fellas. This ain't my first time at the rodeo.""

[Verse 2]
I dream filthy (My mom and pops)
Mixed me with Jamaican (Rum and whiskey, what a set off)
And I know I'm not perfect baby
I done been through so much trauma, it gonna be hard to reverse it
With some doctors and some nurses maybe
Teach me on how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'Cedes
This relationship shit is complicated
All I know if we ain't speaking everyday, I fucking hate it
I don't wanna duplicate it
I seen my mom and pop drive each other mothafuckin' crazy
And I got that nigga blood in me
I got his ego and his temper, all is missing is the drugs in me

[Hook]
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor
Apologies in order to Blue Ivy my daughter
If it was up to me, you would be with me, sort of like daddy dearest
[Interlude]
""No... wire... hangers... EVER!""

[Verse 3]
Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother
I don't wanna have to just repeat another leave another
Baby with no daddy want no momma drama
I just wanna take her back to a time when everything was calmer
Out in Paris on a terrace watching the Eiffel Tower
And a Ferris wheel yet and still, nothing could prepare us
For the beauty that you be Blue be
Looking in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy
Without these back and forth thoughts, you too much like your daddy
Badly I just wanna spent more time with him
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps
Cut the cord watch her take her first breath
And I'm trying and I'm lying if I said I wasn't scared
But in life and death if I ain't here

[Hook]
High on life
I could die from the fall, imagine if I hit the floor

[Intro]
Turn my music high, high, high, higher
(You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—)
Sure, I do

[Verse 1]
I'm from the streets where the hood could swallow 'em and
Bullets'd follow 'em and
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom
And cops comb the shit top to bottom
And say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street, holmes
But this is worse than the Dow Jones, your brains are now blown
All over that brown Brougham, one slip, you are now gone
Welcome to Hell, where you are welcome to sell
But when them shells come, you better return 'em
All scars, we earn 'em
All cars, we learn 'em like the back of our hand
We watch for cops hoppin' out the back of vans
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan
This ain't a sewn outfit, holmes, holmes is about it
Was clappin' them flamers before I became famous
For playin' me, y'all shall forever remain nameless
[Interlude]
I am Hov (You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—)
Sure I do

[Verse 2]
I tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin' to get they ones, I'm tryin' to get them M's
One million, two million, three million, four
In just five years, forty million more
You are now lookin' at the forty million boy
I'm rapin' Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man

[Interlude]
R-O-C (You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—)
That's where you're wrong

[Verse 3]
I came into this motherfucker hundred grand strong
Nine to be exact, from grindin' G-packs
Put this shit in motion, ain't no rewindin' me back
Could make forty off a brick, but one rhyme could beat that
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov would sell clothin'
Not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind
That's another difference that's between me and them
I smarten up, open the market up
One million, two million, three million, four
In eighteen months, eighty million more
Now add that number up with the one I said before
You are now lookin' at one smart Black boy
Mama ain't raise no fool
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth, motherfucker
[Interlude]
I will not lose (You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—)
Put somethin' on it

[Verse 4]
I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in Hell
I am a hustler, baby, I'll sell water to a whale
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states
Cop the coupe with the roof gone and switch plates
Was born to dictate, never follow orders, dick face
Get your shit straight, fucker, this is Big Jay

[Outro]
I— hahahaha (You don't know what you're doin'— doin'— doin'—)
Will not lose, ever

[Intro]
Woo! Geah, geah (Young) geah
Uhh, turn the music up, turn the lights down
I'm in my zone

[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 1]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell, standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church, pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like, ""Damn, that man's face is just like my face""
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homie, you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in Heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!
[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 2]
Music business hate me ‘cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell ""holla""
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' – I ain't been rhyming like Common since (Whoo)
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception! Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homie and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them (rims, that is)
[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths

Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt
Y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close, you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths

[Verse 3]
My homie Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
‘Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See, in my inner circle, all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, ‘cause I really been there before
Four scores and seven years ago, prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though, these words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo, my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me, nigga? Scars will scab
What, you gonna box me, homie? I can dodge a jab
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back!
[Chorus]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty
The world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse

Thank you, thank you, thank you!
You're far too kind

[Chorus]
Now, can I get a encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise!

[Verse 1]
Who you know fresher than Hov? Riddle me that
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G Rap in his prime
I'm Young H-O, rap's Grateful Dead
Back to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country, but the blueberry still connect
On the low, but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep
Grand openin', grand closin'
Goddamn, your man Hov cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him?
With no pen, just draw off inspiration
Soon you gonna see you can't replace him
With cheap imitations for these generations
[Chorus]
Now, can I get an encore? Do you want more?
Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin' for?

[Verse 2]
(*Sighs*) Look what you made me do! Look what I made for you!
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearin' the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team!
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales to sold-out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream 'til your lungs get sore
[Interlude]
Owww, it's star time
This man is mean, he's killin' all y'all jive turkeys
Do y'all want more of the Jigga man?
Well, if y'all want more of the Jigga man
Then I need y'all to help me bring him back to stage
Say ""Hova!"" – c'mon, say it!
Are y'all out there? [crowd chants ""HO-VA! HO-VA!""]
C'mon, louder!
Yeah, now see that's what I'm talking about
They love you, Jigga! They love you, Jigga!

[Break]
I like the way this one feel
It's so motherfuckin' soulful, man!
(Whoaaaaaahhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh, whoahhhhhhhhhhhhh)
Yeah [crowd still chanting] okay

[Verse 3]
So this here is the victory lap
Then I'm leavin', that's how you get me back
After a year of them 16's, it's 1.2
And that's 2.4, and I'm only doin' two
You wanted to gain attention, new dudes
I can get you BET – and TRL, too
You want to be in the public, send your budget
Well, fuck it, I ain't budgin'
Young did it to death, you gotta love it
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it
Now look at me: all star-studded
Golfer above par like I putted
All ‘cause the shit I uttered was utterly ridiculous
How sick is this?
You want to bang, send Kanye change
Send Just some dust, send Hip a grip
Then you gotta spit a little somethin' like this

Made Hov say, ""Okay, so? Make another Hov!""
Niggas wasn't playin' they day role
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though
I put friends over business end of the day though
But when friends' business interests is Day Glow
Ain't nothin' left to say though, I guess we forgot what we came fo'
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage
Too much flossin', too much Sam Rothstein
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them
Hov had to get the shallow shit up off him
And I ain't even want to be famous
Niggas is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes
And I ain't even know how it came to this
Except that fame is the worst drug known to man
It's stronger than, heroin
When you could look in the mirror like, ""There I am""
And still not see what you've become
I know I'm guilty of it too, but not like them; you lost one

I don't think it's meant to be, B
For she loves her work more than she does me
And honestly, at twenty-three
I would probably love my work more than I did she
So, we ain't we, it's me and her
'Cause what she prefers over me is work
And that's where we differ
So I have to give her free time, even if it hurts
So, breathe, mami, it's deserved
You've been put on this Earth to be all you can be like the Reserves
And me? My time in the army, it's served
So I have to allow she her time to serve
The time's now for her, in time she'll mature
And maybe we can be we again like we were
Finally, my time's too short to share
And to ask her now it ain't fair, so yeah, she lost one

My nephew died in the car I bought
So under the belief it's partly my fault
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought
Place any burden on me but please, not that, Lord
But time don't go back, it goes forward
Can't run from the pain, go towards it
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it
'Til that time, little man, I'm nauseous

Almost lost my faith, that restored it

To return, when I lost you, I lost it

First the Fat Boys break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got a problem with Hov
What's up? Y'all niggas all fed up 'cause I got a little cheddar
And my record's movin' out the store?
Young fucks spittin' at me, young rappers gettin' at me
My nigga Big predicted this shit exactly
""Mo' Money, Mo' Problems,"" gotta move carefully
'Cause faggots hate when you gettin' money like athletes
Youngins ice-grillin' me, oh, you not feelin' me?
Fine, it cost you nothin', pay me no mind
Look, I'm on my grind, cousin, ain't got time for frontin'
Sensitive thugs, y'all all need hugs
Damn, little mans, I'm just tryna do me
If the record's two mil', I'm just tryna move three
Get a couple chicks, get 'em to try to do E
Hopefully they'll ménage before I reach my garage
I don't want much, fuck, I drove every car
Some nice cooked food, some nice clean drawers
Bird-ass niggas, I don't mean to ruffle y'all
I know you waitin' in the wing, but I'm doin' my thing
Where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland & JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
I said where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Yeah)
[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
And then the Fugees gon' break up, now every day I wake up
Somebody got somethin' to say
What's all the fuckin' fussin' for?
Because I'm grubbin' more?
And I pack heat like I'm the oven door?
Niggas pray and pray on my downfall
But every time I hit the ground, I bounce up like roundball
Now, I don't wanna have to kill soundboys
Don't wanna have to cock back the four-pound bar
Look, scrapper, I got nephews to look after
I'm not lookin' at you dudes, I'm lookin' past ya
I thought I told you characters I'm not a rapper
Can I live?
I told you '96 that I came to take this shit and I did
Handle my biz, I scramble like Randall with his
Cunningham, but the only thing runnin' is numbers, fam
Jigga held you down six summers, damn, where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland & JAY-Z]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Niggas, where's the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Holla at me)
Ain't no love (Take 'em to church), in the heart of the city
Uh, uh, uh, uh, my nigga, where is the love?
Ain't no love in the heart of town (Fuck)
[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Then Richard Pryor go and burn up
And Ike and Tina Turner break up
Then I wake up to more bullshit
You knew me before records, you never disrespected me
Now that I'm successful, you'll pull this shit
Nigga, I'll step on your porch, step to your boss
Let's end the speculation, I'm talkin' to all of y'all
Males shouldn't be jealous, that's a female trait
What, you mad 'cause you push dimes and he sell weight?
Y'all don't know my expenses, I gotta buy bigger plates
Haha, and more baggies, why you all aggy?
Nigga, respect the game, that should be it
What you eat don't make me shit
Where's the love?
Where's the love?

[Chorus: Bobby Bland]
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town
Ain't no love in the heart of the city
Ain't no love in the heart of town

Can I hit in the mornin' without givin' you half of my dough
And even worse, if I was broke would you want me
If I couldn't get you finer things like all of them diamond rings
Bitches kill for would you still roll
If we couldn't see the sun risin' off the shore of Thailand
Would you ride then, if I wasn't driving
If I wasn't a eight-figure nigga by the name of Jigga
Would you come around me or would you clown me
If I couldn't flow futuristic, would ya
Put your two lips on my wood and kiss it, could ya
See yourself with a nigga working harder than nine to five
Ten to six, two jobs to survive, or
Do you need a baller, so you can shop and tear the mall up
Brag, tell your friends what I bought ya
If you couldn't see yourself with a nigga when his dough is low
Baby girl, if this is so, yo

Can you afford me? My niggas breadwinners, never corny
Ambition makes me so horny
Not the fussin' and the frontin'
If you got nothing, baby boy, you better
Get up, get out and get some, shit
I like a - lot of Prada, Alizé and vodka
Late nights, candlelight, then I tear the cock up
Get it up I put it down e'rytime it pop up, huh
I got to snap 'em, let it loose, then I knock ya
Feel the juice, then I got ya - when you produce a rock
I let you meet momma and introduce you to poppa

Before they go runnin' they mouth, promotin' how
I be dickin' they, back out, go 'head, let it out
I fucks with my Gat out, bounce and leave a hundred
Makin' 'em feel slutted even if they don't want it
It's been so long, since I met a chick ain't about chips but then I'm
Dead wrong, when I tell 'em, ""be gone""
So hold on to the feelin' of flossin' and plat-num
'Cause from now on, you can witness Ja the i-con

I seen Mase do it, I seen 'Ye do it
'X came through, caught lighter fluid
Still I came through it; clap for him!
But I’m the blueprint, I'm like the map for 'em
I dropped another classic, made Puff pass it
Nobody could touch Puff back when Puff had it
Wayne scorchin', I'll applaud him
If he keep going, pass the torch to him
Fifty came through like hurricanes do
I thought I finished his ass at Summer Jam too
I had the Illmatic on bootleg
The shit was so ahead, thought we was all dead
Wayne did ""A Milli,"" Fifty did a milli
'Ye too, but what Em did was silly
The white boy blossomed after Dre endorsed him
His flow on ""Renegade"": fucking awesome
Applaud him!

Snoop dogged it, Nelly came down
The Face Mob kept it ghetto for the H-Town
Luda moved digits after he moved bitches
Drake's up next, see what he do with it (Uh-huh)
Rule had a run, couple movie parts
T.I. literally wanted to shoot up the charts
What up, Jeezy? What it do?
Y’all remind me of us in early '92 (Uh-huh)
Outkast landed, 3-thou was ill
Like a male version of Lauryn Hill
Mobb Deep shook it, but Prodigy took it
A lil' too far, can't fuck with Brooklyn
Wu-Tang gangbanged it, Meth ate
Rae took on the date with the Purple Tape
Passed on to Ason and then Ghostface
They had a hell of a run, standing ovay', ayy

And I am one of one
Can’t you see just how long my run?
My reign, Lulu's son-shine
Been a star since I was ducking one-time
One time, give it up for him
December 4th, a star was born
Clap for him! He went from moving that corner
To this corner office, it's so enormous
Hey!
Prez' Carter watching her get her Monica on all day
Hey, got so many different monikers, but only one Jay
They come, they go
Some real, some faux
Some friends, some hoes
But, no, I goes nowhere, this Hov'

And could I be a star?
Does fame in this game have to change who you are?
Or could I be the same one who came from a far-away life
Just to make it in these Broadway lights?
Now I'm shining in the broad daylight—go figure
A slow transition from a lil' broke nigga from the 'Ville
Got a deal, a real lifesaver
Dreams of being behind the wheel like Jada
I chill now, cop a lil' ice later
Cole, you got the glow like a lil' lightsaber
So clap for him!
Then applaud Hov, he gave him a platform
Flow so sick, thought he wrote the rap for him—no, sir!
The flow cold as the shoulders of gold-digging hoes when a broke nigga 'proaches
Told you I’m focused, man
I’ll let you motherfuckers soak it in, and clap for 'em!

Fuck fist fights and lame scuffles (uh)
Pillow case to your face, make the shell muffle (woo)

While others spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's about
Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine till the dough hit it and told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but, no bitches
Watch how I'm walkin', 'cause even the thoroughest niggas be NARC'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain, hopin' that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil, thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch a
Freeze off my kneecap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinkin' Cristals, re-up the fee
Rappers goin' broke tryin' to keep up with me
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder

You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L, but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven, then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruisin' in your 7, next day, you're sweatin', forgettin' your lies
Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
'Bout to start bitchin', ain't you? Ready to start snitchin', ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak-ass: hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honies that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped in the station, filled up on octane, and now they not sane
And not playin', that goes without sayin'
Slayin' day in and day out, when money play in, then they play you out
Tryin' to escape my own mind, lurkin' the enemy
Representin' infinity with presidencies, you know?

Merci, you're fine as fuck, but you giving me hell

Asked her what tribe she with, red dot or feather?
She said, ""All you need to know is I'm not a ho
And to get with me, you better be Chief Lots-a-Dough""

She like, ""Why you don't buy me Reeboks no more?""
Like to show out in public, throw tantrums on the floor
Got to toss a couple dollars just to shut up her holla
Got a project chick that plays her part
And if it goes down, y'all, that's my heart
Baby girl so thorough, she been with me from the start
Hid my drugs from the narcs, hid my guns by the parts
I got this model chick that don't cook or clean
But she dress her ass off and her walk is mean
Only thing wrong with ma, she's always on the scene
Goddamn, she's fine, but she parties all the time
I get frequent flier mileage from my stewardess chick
She look right in that tight blue dress, she's thick
She gives me extra pillows and seat-back love
So I had to introduce her to the mile high club
Now that's young chick, stewardess, project, and model
That means I fly rough early, plus I know Tae Bo
That means I'm new-school, pop pills, and stay in beef
But I never have a problem with my first-class seat, I love
[Chorus: Slick Rick & JAY-Z]
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls all over the globe
I come scoop you in that coupe, sitting on deuce-zeros
Fix your hair in the mirror, let's roll

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
I got this paranoid chick, she's scared to come to the house
A hypochondriac who says ouch before I whip it out (What you doin', daddy?)
Got a chick from Peru that sniff Peru
She got a cousin at customs that gets shit through
Got this weed-head chick, she always catch me doing shit
Crazy girl, wanna leave me, but she always forgets
Got this Chinese chick, had to leave her quick
'Cause she kept bootlegging my shit, man
I got this African chick with Eddie Murphy on her skull
She like, ""Jigga Man, why you treat me like animal?""
I'm like, ""Excuse me, Ms. Fufu, but when I met your ass
You was dead broke and naked, and now you want half""
I got this ho that after twelve million sold
Mami's a narcoleptic, always sleeping on Hov
Got to tie the back of her head like Deuce Bigalow
I've got so many girls across the globe, I love
[Outro: JAY-Z, Biz Markie, Q-Tip & Slick Rick]
Girls, girls, girls, girls
Girls, I do adore
Yo, put your number on this paper, 'cause I would love to date ya
Holla at you when I come off tour
I love girls, girls, girls, girls

And with all this cash (Mo' money, mo' problems)
You'll forget your man

[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Omillio Sparks]
Now give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me
C'mon, gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yeah, uhh, yeah
When the Remy's in the system, ain't no tellin'
Will I fuck 'em? Will I diss 'em? That's what they be yellin'
I'm a pimp by blood, not relation
Y'all be chasin', I replace them, huh?
Drunk off Cris', mami on E
Can't keep her little model hands off me
Both in the club, high, singing off key
""And I wish I never met her at all!""
It gets better, ordered another round
It's, about, to go, down
Got six model chicks, six bottles of Cris'
Four Belvederes, got weed everywhere
What do you say, me, you, and your Chloe glasses (uh-huh)
Go somewhere private where we can discuss fashion?
Like, Prada blouse, Gucci bra (okay)
Filth Mart jeans, take that off
[Chorus: Pharrell Williams & Omillio Sparks]
Give it to me
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
But don't bullshit me

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, save the narrative, you saving it for marriage
Let's keep it real ma, you saving it for carats
You wanna see how far I'ma go
How, much I'ma spend but you already know
Zip, zero, stingy with dinero
Might buy you Cris', but that about it
Might light your wrist, but that about it
Fuck it, I might wife you and buy you nice whips
Ma, but you really gotta ride nice dick
Know how to work your hips and your head's priceless
Profess you love to Hov' and I'll never let you down
Get you bling like the Neptune sound
Okay, hot Hov', too hot to hold
Ladies love me long time like 2Pac's soul
Only way to roll, Jigga and two ladies
I'm too cold, Motorola, two way page me (c'mon)

Y'all mention JAY-Z name?
(This thing on?) JAY-Z, JAY-Z
""In JAY-Z news"" (Check)
I understand what y'all tryna do
I brought the flutes this time though (Check)
Unleash the flutes on 'em, Guru
Give me some more music in the headphone
Let's get to the proceedings preceding this evening
Let's do this thing (Let's do it right this time)
Come on

[Verse 1]
H-O-V-A
I got my mojo back, baby, ""Oh, behave""
Nah, nah, don't be afraid
Y'all and your articles hock spit at Jay
Y'all, from afar, threw darts my way
What you thought, I would not have nothin' to say? Nope
Y'all fell into the booby trap
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now
And now, you's can't leave
You opened the door, God, I'm at you annually
And I'm sorry, Ms. Rosie Perez
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is
But you can't give cred to anything dude says
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head
Shorty, it's time to wake up the dead
You sound a little naïve in them articles that I read
[Chorus]

The Blueprint 2, baby, on the way

I got my mojo back, baby, ""Oh, behave""

[Verse 2]
Can't y'all see that he's fake, the rap version of T.D. Jakes
Prophesizin' on your CD's and tapes
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line (It's real)
Donatin' proceeds off every ticket sold
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed in myself?
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help
They call me this misogynist
But they don't call me the dude to take his dollars to give gifts at the projects
These dudes is all politics, depositin' checks
They put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip (Yap, yap, yap)
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype
'Cause the nigga wear a kufi, it don't mean that he bright
'Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write (The fuck is you sayin'?)
Is it Oochie Wally Wally or is it One Mic?
Is it Black Girl Lost or shorty owe you for ice?
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat
But I will not lose, for even in defeat
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that, though (Haha)
Savin' me the hassle of speakin' to half of these assholes
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history
Who you know flow vicious as me?
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov'
I get the spoils 'cause the victor is me (Me, nigga)
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be
You street dreamin', all y'all niggas livin' through me
I gave you life when niggas was forgettin' you emcee
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen, God, you a flea
And the little homie Jungle is a garden to me
What's the problem, B? You not as hard as me
Nigga, hard as we, nigga, R-O-C, nigga
That's why they follow me
They feel my pain and my agony, nigga
I won't rest 'til you on one knee
You want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga
Until you on one knee
You want war, then it's war it's gon' be, nigga

Ah shit, okay, okay, alright
Big man! You wanna make some big bucks, huh?
Let's see how tough you are
You know something about cocaine? Digame!
You kidding me or what man?
There's a bunch of Colombians coming in Friday - new guys
They said they got two keys for us, for openers
Pure cocaine, you tell 'em, capiche?
I want you to go over there
And if it is what they say it is, you buy it, you bring it back
You can do that you make five grand
Meet them at the Bodegas, noon Friday
You get the buy money then
Oh and chico, if anything happens to the buy money
Eh, pobrecito
JAY-Z's gonna stick your heads up your asses faster than a rabbit gets fucked

Bounce.. bounce, bounce, Jay-Z huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Roc-A-Fella y'all, ha ha
Bounce, bounce, bounce, Roc-A-Fella y'all
Check, check
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Yo, I'm making short term goals when the weather folds
Just put away the leathers and put ice on the gold
Chilly with enough bail money to free a big Willie
High stakes, I got more at stake than Philly
Shopping sprees, cop in three
Deuce fever IS's fully loaded, ah, yes
Bouncing in the Lex Luger, tires smoke like Buddha
50 Gs to the crap shooter, niggas can't fade me
Chrome socks beaming
Through my peripheral I see you scheming
Stop dreaming, I leave your body steaming
Niggas is fiending, what's the meaning
I'm leaning on any nigga intervening
With the sound of my money machining (brrrr)
My cup runneth over with hundreds
I'm one of the best niggas that done it, six digits and running
Y'all niggas don't want it
I got the Godfather flow, the Don Juan DeMarco
Swear to God, don't get it fucked up
[Chorus 1: Mary J. Blige & Jay-Z]
I'm taking out this time (yeah, yeah, what)
To give you a piece of my mind
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Last seen out of state where I drop my sling
I'm deep in the South kicking up top game
Bouncing on the highway switching fo' lanes
Screaming through the sunroof, money ain't a thang
Your worst fear confirmed
Me and my fam roll tight like The Firm
Getting down for life, that's right, you better learn
Why play with fire, you burn
We get together like a choir, to acquire what we desire
We do dirt like worms, produce G's like sperm
'Til legs spread like germs
I got extensive hoes with expensive clothes
And I sip fine wines and spit vintage flows
What y'all don't know?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, cause you can't knock the hustle

[Chorus 2: Mary J. Blige & Jay-Z]
But until then lately, I'm the one who's crazy?
'Cause that's the way you're making me feel
('Cause you can't knock the hustle)
The way you make me feel
I'm just trying to get mine, I don't have the time
To knock the hustle for real

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Yo, y'all niggas lunching, punching the clock
My function is to make much and lay back munching
Sipping Remy on the rocks, my crew something to watch
Nothing to stop, un-stoppable
Scheme on the ice, I gotta hot your crew
I gotta, let you niggas know the time like Movado
My motto, stack rocks like Colorado
Waddle off the champagne, Cristals by the bottle
It's a damn shame what you're not though: (who?) me
Slick like a gato, fucking Jay-Z
My pops knew exactly what he did when he made me
Tried to get a nut and he got a nut and what
Straight bananas; can a nigga see me
Got the US Open, advantage Jigga
Serve like Sampras, play fake rappers like a campus
Le Tigre, son you're too eager
You ain't having it? Good, me either
Let's get together and make this whole world believe us, huh
At my arraignment screaming
All us blacks got is sports and entertainment, until we even
Thieving, as long as I'm breathing
Can't knock the way a nigga eating, fuck you even!
[Chorus 1 + 2: Mary J. Blige]
I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Baby one day you'll be a star

Guru, let's go get 'em again
This time it's for the money my nigga
Brooklyn, stand up

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
There's never been a nigga this good for this long
This hood or this pop, this hot or this strong
With so many different flows, this one's for this song
The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me
You know what? Soon they forget where they plucked
Their whole style from then try to reverse the outcome
I'm like, ""TAA!""
I'm not a biter, I'm a writer for myself and others
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin' up my brother
Biggin' up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out
It's hard to yell when the barrel's in your mouth
I'm in, new sneakers, dual-seaters, few divas
What more can I tell you? Let me spell it for you:
W-I, double-L, I-E
Nobody truer than H-O-V
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up

What more can I say?
What more can I do?
I gave this up to you
I know this much is true, true, true

[Break: Jay-Z]
What more can I say to you? You heard it all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
You already know what I'm about: flyin' birds down South
Movin' wet off the step, purple rain in a drought
Stuntin' on hoes, brushin' off my shirt
But ain't nothin' on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name
Young H-O, pitch the yay faithful
Even if they patrol, I make payroll
Benz paid for, friends they roll
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos
Cris' caseloads, I don't give a shit
Nigga, one life to live, I can't let a day go
By without me bein' fly, fresh to death
Head to toe 'til the day I rest
And I don't wear jerseys, I'm 30-plus
Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga, button-ups
S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete
What more can I say? Guru, play the beat!
[Break: Jay-Z (Hum-V)]
My nigga, hahahaha, woo!
We gon' let this ride into the hook
- I'ma snap my fingers on this one
What more can I say to you?
- Get my grown man on
LET'S GO!

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Now you know your ass is Willie when they got you in the mag
For like half a billy and your ass ain't lily-White
That mean that shit you write must be illy
Either that or your flow is silly, it's both!
I don't mean to boast, but damn, if I don't brag
Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass
The Martha Stewart that's far from Jewish
Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it
And no I'm not through with it
In fact, I'm just previewin' it
This ain't the show, I'm just EQin' it
One-two and I won't stop abusin' it
To groupie girls: stop false accusin' it
Back to the music - the Maybach roof is translucent
Niggas got a problem, Houston!
What up B, they can't shut up me
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride
God forgive me for my brash delivery
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me
So picture me lettin' these clowns nitpick at me
Paint me like a pickany
I will literally kiss TT in the forehead
Tell her, ""Please forgive me,"" then squeeze into your forehead
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact
I got a joint that'll knock your points off
Young Hova the God, nigga, blast for me
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere, you ain't never there
And nigga, why would I ever care?
Pound for pound, I'm the best to ever come around here
Excludin' nobody, look what I embody:
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street
A CEO's mind, that marketin' plan was me
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines
And I ain't animated like, say, a Busta Rhymes
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times
Times that by my influence on pop culture
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist
Fuck this man!

I probably owe it to y'all, probably be locked by the force
Tryin' to hustle some things that go with the Porsche
Feelin' no remorse, feelin' like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law, nigga, grippin' my balls
Said the ladies, they love me, from the bleachers they screamin'
All the ballers is bouncin', they like the way I be leanin'
All the rappers be hatin' off the track that I'm makin'
But all the hustlers, they love it, just to see one of us make it
Came from the bottom of the bottom, to the top of the pops
Nigga, London, Japan and I'm straight off the block
Like a running back, get it? Man, I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga, ‘cause I'm straight with the Roc

I just whipped up a watch, tryin' to get me a Rover
Tryin' to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya
But, like, 52 cards went out, I'm through dealin'
Now 52 bars come out, now you feel 'em
Now 52 cars roll out, remove ceilin'
In case 52 broads come out, now you chillin'
With a boss, bitch, of course, S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real

Me and my beautiful bee-itch in the back of that 'Bach
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggas scared of that black
I drop that Black Album, then I back out it
As the best rapper alive, nigga, ask 'bout me
From bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammy's
From O's to opposite of Orphan Annie
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin' out the Garden in a day

Got some dirt on my shoulder; could you brush it off for me?

That's major, just like the Negro League
There was a time America wouldn't let us ball
Those times are now back, just now called Afro-tech
Generational wealth, that's the key
My parents ain't have shit, so that shift started with me
My mom took her money, she bought me bonds
That was the sweetest thing of all time, uh

[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellence baby, you gon' let 'em see
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellency, baby, let 'em see
[Interlude: JAY-Z]
I remember, like, listenin' to Wu-Tang
And niggas like, ""Your seed married his seed, married my seed""
That's how we keep Carter money all in the family

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
You see, my father, son of a preacher man
Whose daughter couldn't escape the reach of the preacher's hand
That charge of energy set all the Carters back
It took all these years to get to zero in fact
I hated religion 'cause here was this Christian
He was preachin' on Sundays, versus how he was livin' Monday
Someday I forgive him
'Cause strangely our division led to multiple religions
I studied Muslim, Buddhist, and Christians
And I was runnin' from him, He was givin' me wisdom
See how the universe works?
It takes my hurt and help me find more of myself
It's a gift and a curse
That's called the Red Queen's Race

[Bridge: JAY-Z]
You run this hard just to stay in place
Keep up the pace, baby
Keep up the pace
You run this hard just to stay in place
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
Legacy, Legacy, Legacy, Legacy
Black excellence, you gon' let 'em see

Nickels and dimes
Sticks to my mind
I want more than
You have my friends

[Verse 1]
Got a thing for nickel plated nines and pretty dimes
MAC-11, I squeeze like lemon limes
Squirt obey your thirst, fashion lines
'tween beauty and beast, I walk the line
Johnny Cash, I'm a real G
I cut myself today to see if I still bleed
Success is so sublime
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind
Something 'bout the struggle so divine
This sort of love is hard to define
When you scratching for every nickel and dime
Got me itching to do this shit for my mom
Do this shit for my town
Leave the door open hoping they kick it down
The purest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous
We gon' make it there, I promise this

[Hook: Gonjasufi]
Nickels and dimes
Sticks to my mind
I want more than
You have my friends
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel survivor's guilt
I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell
Now I'm part of the problem far as I could tell
Did I do it for him or do it for myself
Can't lie to myself
I love my niggas more than my own blood
I die for my niggas and I love my cub, hope that's not fucked up
I got a problem with the handouts, I took the man route
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now
No guilt in giving clear a nigga conscience out
No guilt in receiving, every thing within reason
Can't see it taking food out my little monster's mouth
That'll drive me gaga
Run up in your momma's house, two nickels, one dime
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down
I'm just trying to find common ground
'fore Mr. Belafonte come and chop a nigga down
Mr. Day O, major fail
Respect these youngins boy, it's my time now
Hublot homie, two door homie
You don't know all the shit I do for the homies

Nickels and dimes
Sticks to my mind
I want more than

It all depends
How the story is
Nickels and dimes
Tickle my mind

[Verse 3]
Pardon my hubris, Stanley Kubrick
With eyes wide shut, I could cook up two bricks
Turn nickels to dime, turn dimes to quarters
Turn wives from daughters, oh, I'm clear as water
And just for clarity, my presence is charity
My flow is a gift, philanthropist
Everybody 'round me rich, or will be
Baby boy I promise you this, or kill me
And when a nigga go as the old adage go
You die rich and you die disgraced, so just let me grow
Watch me cook, throw no looks
Like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked, yeah
Y'all not worthy, sometimes I feel like
Y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly
The greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous
So here y'all go, I promise this

[Hook]
Hundred dollar bills

[Verse 1]
Benjamin Franklins filled, fold it just for the thrill
Go numb until I can't feel, or might pop this pill
Stock markets just crash, now I'm just a bill
History don't repeat itself, it rhymes, 1929, still
Write like Mark Twain, Jay Gatsby, I park things
Yellow cars, yellow gold like Slick Rick, still tip
On four-four's (Who?) Four-four's at the 4-0 (Wait) for O
Dollars fall on the skin, some might call it sin
Politicians all move for money, what the hell are we calling 'em?
Low life, I'm crawling out, 911, I Porsched it out
Y'all niggas all hypocrites, y'all know what this shit is all about

So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin' along
With a flashy nigga braggin' on the song
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that

Smiley faces after all of her phrases

I keep it realer than most, I know you feeling it
Cristal's on ice, I like to toast, I keep on spilling it
Bone crushers I keep real close, I got the skill for this
On my back the flyest clothes, looking ill as shit
Transactions illegitimate 'cause life is still a bitch, and then you die
But for now, life, close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers, had nothing to live for like them lifers but
Making sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circle us, success, they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas with some shit that'll light ya life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich, your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall 'cause everyone will be each others crutches
I hope you fools choose to listen, I drop jewels, bust it

I'm thorough, in every borough, my name be ringing
Warming it up for the perfect time to hit your brain, and
Ya feelin' it? To all the girls that bought a girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt, they can vouch my life is real as shit
'95 South and Papi on the Hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed with, shit
And all the thorough-ass niggas that I hustle with
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit

I keep it tight for all the nights my momma prayed I'd stop
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares, ma, those dreams that you say you've got
Give me the chills but these mills, well, they make me hot
Y'all don't feel me, enough to stop the illing right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feeling tight
I'm so confused, okay I'm getting weeded now
I know I contradicted myself, look, I don't need that now
It's just once in a blue when there's nothing to do
And the tension gets too thick for my sober mind to cut through

[Intro: Gloria Carter]
Shawn Carter was born December 4th, weighing in at 10 pounds, 8 ounces. He was the last of my four children. The only one who didn't give me any pain when I gave birth to him. And that's how I knew that he was a special child.

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
They say ""They never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone.""
So on that note, I'm leavin' after this song
So you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay, so long
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnis Reeves
Who made love under the sycamore tree
Which makes me a more sicker MC, and my momma would claim
At 10 pounds, when I was born, I didn't give her no pain
Although through the years I gave her her fair share
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here
She knows my purpose wasn't purpose; I ain't perfect, I care
But I feel worthless 'cause my shirts wasn't matchin' my gear
Now I'm just scratchin' the surface
'Cause what's buried under there
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn was a very shy child growing up. He was into sports, and a funny story is at 4 he taught himself how to ride a bike. A two-wheeler at that, isn't that special? But I noticed a change in him when me and my husband broke up.
[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Now, all the teachers couldn't reach me
And my momma couldn't beat me
Hard enough to match the pain of my pops not seein' me
So, with that disdain in my membrane
Got on my pimp game; fuck the world, my defense came
Then DeHaven introduced me to the game
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine, I'm a hustler now
My gear is in and I'm in the in-crowd
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin' me now
My self-esteem went through the roof, man, I got my swag
Got a Volvo from this girl when her man got bagged
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had
Supposedly, knowin' nobody paid Jaz wack-ass
I'm gettin' ahead of myself; by the way, I could rap
But that came second to me movin' this crack
""Gimme a second, I swear,"" I would say about my rap career
'Til '96 came, niggas, I'm here; goodbye!

[Interlude: Gloria Carter]
Shawn used to be in the kitchen, beating on the table and rapping until the wee hours of the morning. And then I bought him a boom box, and his sisters and brothers said he would drive them nuts. But that was my way to keep him close to me and out of trouble.

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
Goodbye to the game, all the spoils, the adrenaline rush
Your blood boils you in the spot, knowin' cops could rush
And you in a drop, you're so easy to touch
No two days are alike except the first and fifteenth, pretty much
And ""trust"" is a word you seldom hear from us
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up
And the drought will define a man when the well dries up
You learn the worth of water without work
You thirst 'til you die, yup!
And niggas get tied up for product
And little brothers' ring fingers get cut up
To show mothers they really got 'em
And this was the stress I lived with
'Til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin', I pray I'm forgiven
For every bad decision I made, every sister I played
‘Cause I'm still paranoid to this day
And it's nobody's fault, I made the decisions I made
This is the life I chose, or rather, the life that chose me
[Outro: JAY-Z]
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
Maybe you'll love me when I fade...45Embed"

All your lack of aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set, men (uhh, uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence
[Chorus]
La da da da...
Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...
Only nigga to re-write history without a pen
No I.D. on the track let the story begin...
Begin...

[Verse 2]
This ain't a number one record (uhh!)
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (uhh!)
I made this just for Flex and... Mister Cee
I want niggas to feel threatened (uhh!)
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
Your colors too bright, your voice too light (That's too far, nigga!) (uhh, uhh!)
I might wear black for a year straight (uhh!)
I might bring back Versace shades (uhh!)
This ain’t for Z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it 100 (uhh!)
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled, for we the bestin... (uhh!)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of Auto-Tune, moment of silence

Hey, hey, hey, goodbye...

[Verse 3]
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy... Ay!
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it (uhh!)
Get 3 Thou' to style on this
I just don’t need nobody to smile on this (uhh!)
You niggas singin' too much
Get back to rap, you T-Pain'n too much (uhh, uhh!)
I’m a multi-millionaire
So how is it I’m still the hardest nigga here (uhh!)
I don’t be in the project hallway
Talkin' 'bout how I be in the projects all day (uhh!)
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta, this is how you prove it to me (uhh, uhh!)

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
I am a Roc representer (Oh)
Summer to winter (Oh), dead or alive (Uh)
24/7, three-sixty-five
One CD or three hundred and sixty pies
What's up to E and Kirk? Welcome home to Taj
Let no amount of money ruin this thing of ours (Uh)
We run streets like drunks run streetlights
We collidin' with life as we speak
We knee-deep in coke, we key-deep in ice
We flood streets with dope, we keep weed to smoke
We all fish, better teach your folk
Give him money to eat, the next week, he's broke
'Cause when you sleep, he's reachin' for your throat
Word on the street, you reap what you sow
Not out of fear, but love, love for the game
Roc family first, we never change, man
[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Never, never, never, never change
I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change)
Out hustlin', same clothes for days (I never change)

I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change, that's right)
Out hustlin', same clothes for days (I never change, c'mon)
I never change, I'm too stuck in my ways, I'll never change

What's up to my Miami and St. Thomas connects? (What up?)
I'd never mention your name, I promise respect
Death before dishonor, correct?
Yup, that's what you promised me since the Bomber League
Along with if we stay strong
We can get paper longer than Pippen's arms (Woo)
Plead the Fifth when it comes to the fam
I'm like a dog, I never speak, but I understand
Where my dogs at? Where my soldiers at war?
Where your balls at? Woah, gotta pause that (Woah)
Lost ninety-two bricks, had to fall back
Knocked a nigga off his feet, but I crawled back
Had A1 credit, got more crack
From the first to the fifth, gave it all back
If I'm not a hustler, what you call that?
This is before rap ('Fore), this is all fact (Fact), I never change
[Chorus: Kanye West & JAY-Z]
Never, never, never, never change
I'm still fuckin' with crime, 'cause crime pays (I never change)

[Verse 3: JAY-Z]
'Fore the streets robbed me, wasn't educated properly
Well, fuck y'all, I needed money for Atari
Was so young, my big sis still playin' with Barbie
Young brother, big city, eight million stories
Old heads taught me, ""Youngin, walk softly""
Carry a big clip that'll get niggas off me
Keep coke in coffee, keep money smellin' mothy
Chains is cool to cop, but more important is lawyer fees (Uh)
That's how it is now (Uh), that's how it always be (Uh)
I never change, this is always me
From the womb to the tomb, from now 'til my doom
Drink Army from one cup, pass it around the room (That's a family, nigga)
That's the ritual (Yup), Big Ran, I ain't forget you, fool
And all that bullshit you tryin' to get through
This is crew love, move music or move drugs
Rival crews, get your black suits up, I'll never change

Uh huh, ge-ge ge-ge-geah
Ye-ye-yeah, ye-ye-yeah, (Brooklyn)
How real is, this?
How real is, this? (Brooklyn)
Uh-huh huh  (Brooklyn)
Respect this here, check!

[Verse 1]
I'm from where the hammers rung, news cameras never come
You and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme
Where the grams was slung, niggas vanish every summer
When the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet
Faced with immeasurable odds, still I gave straight bets
So I felt I'm owed something and you nothing, check
I'm from the other side where the other guys don't walk too much
And girls from the projects wouldn't fuck us, said we talked too much
So they ran up to Tompkins and sought them dudes to trust
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, summertime's unforgettable
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new
Your word was everything, so everything you said you'd do
You did it, couldn't talk about it if you ain't live it
I'm from where niggas pull your card, and argue all day about
Who's the best MCs, Biggie, Jay-Z or Nas?
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs are at odds
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R-and-R's
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars, is that all?
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars
I'm from Marcy, son, just thought I'd remind y'all
[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 2]
I'm from the place where the church is the flakiest
And niggas been praying to God so long that they atheist
Where you can't put your vest away
And say you'll wear it tomorrow
'Cause the day after we'll be saying
""Damn, I was just with him yesterday""
I'm a block away from hell
Not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple beam
Still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing, you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base dwell
And government? Fuck government! Niggas politick theyselves
Where we call the cops the A-Team
'Cause they hop out of vans and spray things
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eighteens
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies
So tell me when I rap, you think I give a fuck who criticize?
If the shit is lies, God strike me
And I got a question:
Are you forgiving guys who live just like me? We'll never know
One day I prayed to you and said if I ever blow, I'd let 'em know
The stakes, and exactly what takes place in the ghetto
Promise fulfilled, still I feel my job ain't done
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Brooklyn... so where you from?)

[Verse 3]
Check, I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen
I'm up the block, around the corner and down the street
From where the pimps, prostitutes and the drug lords meet
We make a million off of beats, 'cause our stories is deep
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet
Niggas get lost for weeks in the street, twisted off leek
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat
Whether you're four-feet or Manute size
It always starts out with three dice and ""shoot the five""
Niggas thought they deuce was live, then I hit 'em with trips
And I reached down for their money, pa, forget about this
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist
And this Glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this
Niggas'll show you love, that's how they fool thugs
Before you know it, you're lying in a pool of blood
Where I'm from
[Chorus]
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice
(Mentally been many places but I'm Brooklyn's own)
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice

My man!
Speech!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
First of all, I wanna thank my connect
The most important person, with all due respect
Thanks to the duffle bag, the brown paper bag
The Nike shoe box for holding all this cash (Okay!)
Boys in blue who put greed before the badge (Okay!)
The first pusher who ever made the stash (Okay!)
The Roc Boys in the building tonight (Hey!)
Oh, what a feeling, I'm feeling life (Hey!)
Thanks to the lames, niggas with bad aim
Thanks to a little change, I tore you out the game
Bullet wounds will stop your buffoonery
Thanks to the pastor, rapping at your eulogy
To Lil' Kim and them, you know the women-friend who
Carry the work cross state for a gentlemen
Yeah, thanks to all the hustlers
And most importantly you: the customer

Let ya hair down baby, I just hit a score
Pick any place on the planet, pick a shore
Take what the Forbes figured, then figure more
'Cause they forgot to account what I did with the raw
Pick a time, let's pick apart some stores
Pick a weekend for freaking for figure fours
I figure frauds never hit a lick before
So they don't know the feeling when them things get across
Put ya hand out the window, feel the force
Feel the Porsche, hit defrost
Ice-cold, jewels got no flaws
Drop got no top, you on the top floor
Pink Rosé, think OJ
I get away with murder when I sling yay
Her-on got less steps than Britney
That means it ain't stepped on, dig me?

Rare guns if you dare come near the fortress

This kinda talk is only reserved for the bosses
Which means I get it from the ground
Which means you get it when I'm around

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G. in a 1996 MTV interview]
Gotta try to stay above water, y'know?
Just stay busy, stay working
Puff told me, like, the key to this joint
The key to staying on top of things
Is treat everything like it's your first project, nomsayin'?
Like it's your first day, like, back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Y'all wanna know why he don't stop?
Y'all wanna know why he don't flop?
Let me tell you pe-people why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out selling dimes and nicks
Graduated to a brick
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip
Legendary like a schoolboy
Crushin' merely nearly every every chick
Heavy shit – that's how schoolboy got whipped
And got left on some Just Me, Myself and I
On some Trugoy shit
Had to voyage to a place of, to a place of no return
Had to play with fire and get burned
Only way the boy ever gon' learn
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Like I never rode in a limo
Like I just dropped flows to a demo
Like it's '92 again and I got O's in the rental
Back in the Stu' again
No prob' livin' was a whole lot simple
When you think back, you thought that
You would never make it this far
Then you take advantage of the luck you handed
Or the talent you been given
Ain't no half steppin', ain't no, no slippin'
Ain't no different from a block that's hittin'
Gotta get it while the getting's good
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, before you stop
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance
Goodbye! This is my second major breakup
My first was with a pager
With a hooptie, a cookpot and the GAME
This one's with the stu', with the stage, with the fortune
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME
[Chorus: JAY-Z]
It's my life, it's my pain and my struggle
The songs that I sing to you is my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst is the same as when I came
It's my joy and my tears
And the laughter it brings to me, it's my everything
Treat my first like my last, and my last like my first
And my thirst like the first song I sang

[Intro: JAY-Z, Pharrell]
Young! It's the life
Once again it's the life, yes
I don't know why, I.. get so high oh
It's intoxicating, man, y'all don't know why you do what you do
Get so high oh, get so high, high off the life

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
The allure of breaking the law
Was always too much for me to ever ignore
I've got a thing for the big-body Benzes, it dulls my senses
In love with a V-Dub engine
Man, I'm high off life, fuck it, I'm wasted
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemars Piguet wrist
My women-friends get tennis bracelets
Trips to Venice, get their Winters replaced with
The sun...it ain't even fun no more, I'm jaded
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it
I put my feet in the footprints left to me
Without saying a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy
Man, my brother hustled so, naturally
Up next was me, but what perplexes me
Shit, I know how this movie ends, still I play
The starring role in ""Hovito's Way""
[Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinking distilled vodka
Until I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real
Peel the top up like a toupée, mix the water with the soda
Turn the pot up, make a soufflé
All of y'all can get it like group-page on your two-way
I'm living proof that crime do pay
Say ""hooray"" to the bad guy, and all the broads
Putting cars in their name, for the stars of the game
Putting 'caine in their bras and their tomorrows on the train:
All in the name of love
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came
Over the house to take back everything that they claimed
Or even the worse pain is the distress
Learning you're the mistress only after that love gets slain
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust
Now it gets tough to ever love again
But the allure of the game, keeps calling your name
To all the Lauras of the world, I feel your pain
To all the Christies in different cities and Tiffany Lanes:
We all hustlers in love with the same thing
[Chorus:  JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
I never felt more alive than riding shotgun
In Klein's green 5, until the cops pulled guns
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need -
What the game did to my pulse - with no results
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close
The game is a light bulb with eleventy-million volts
And I'm just a moth addicted to the floss
The doors lift from the floor and the tops come off
By any means necessary, whatever the cost
Even if it means lives is lost
And I can't explain why I just love to get high
Drink, ""life!"" smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times
I may not even be alive
I mean even James Dean couldn't escape the allure
Dying young, leaving a good-looking corpse
Of course...
[Chorus: JAY-Z, Pharrell]
It's just life, I solemnly swear
To change my approach, stop shaving coke
Stay away from hoes, put down the toast
'Cause I be doing the most (Oh no!)
But every time I felt ""That was that"", it called me right back
It called me right back
Man, it called me right back (Oh no!)

[Outro:  JAY-Z, Pharrell]
Once again its the life
Yeah I said its the life
Once I again its the life

[Intro: Armand Assante from American Gangster]
""Your success took a shot at you. What are you going to do now? How are you gonna kill it? You're gonna become unsuccessful? Frank, you can be successful and have enemies, uh?
Be unsuccessful too, and even have friends.""

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
I got these niggas, Breezy, don't worry about it
Let that bitch breathe!
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
'Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with
Shit, let that bitch breathe!
I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on-switch
You're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss
Bye bye, my reply... ""BLAH, BLAH""
Blast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was I?
[Break: Jay-Z]
Let that bitch breathe!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more
Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor
I'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out
I mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?
Hold up, let me move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys
(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)
I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the Trump I only slept in once
Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies
Even if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Y'all ain't got nothing for me

[Break: Jay-Z]
Nas, let that bitch breathe!
[Verse 3: Nas]
Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven, I climax from paper
Then ask: ""Why is life worth living?""
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds, young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den
Take everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in
Up your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much
Like Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch
Let this bitch breathe! (Ha heh)

Yo wassup everybody, this is Maria Davis
Mad Wednesdays, we here tonight to have a good time
(Yo! Start the show! Start the show!)
Wait a minute; I see my man over there, Jay-Z
Jay-Z, Dame Dash let me hear that lil tape of yours, and it's phat
Why don't you come up here and kick a lil freestyle?
Put that champagne down, and kick a lil freestyle for me tonight

[Intro: JAY-Z & Audience]
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Y'all motherfuckers must've heard that Tribe Called Quest shit
Let's do it again!
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone... check this out

[Verse 1: JAY-Z]
Too much West Coast dick lickin'
And too many niggas on a mission, doin' your best Jay-Z rendition
Too many rough motherfuckers, I got my suspicions
That you're just fish in a pool of sharks, nigga, listen
Too many bitches wanna be ladies, so if you a ho
I'ma call you a ho, too many bitches are shady
Too many ladies give these niggas too many chances
Too many brothers wannabe lovers don't know what romance is
Too many bitches stuck up from too many sexual advances
No question; Jay-Z got too many answers
I been around this block too many times
Rocked too many rhymes, cocked too many nines, too
To all my brothers it ain't too late to come together
'Cause too much black and too much love, equal forever
I don't follow any guidelines 'cause too many niggas ride mine
So I change styles every two rhymes
[Interlude: JAY-Z]
Hah, what the fuck
That's 22 two's for y'all motherfuckers out there, nahmean?
Shall I continue? Check it out, what?

[Refrain: JAY-Z]
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Can I kick it? (Yes you can!)
Well I'm gone... yo, yo, yo

[Verse 2: JAY-Z]
Copped to reach my quota, push rock, roll up smooth like on ya
Whole groove like hold-up, swoll up
Too many faggot niggas clockin' my spendin'
Exercisin' your gay-like minds like Richard Simmons
If you could catch Jay right, on the late night
Without the eight, right, maybe you could test my weight, right
I dip, spit quicker than you ever seen
Administer pain, next the minister's screamin' your name
At your wake as I peek in, look in your casket
Feelin' sarcastic, ""Look at him, still sleepin'""
You never ready, forever petty minds stay petty
Mine's thinkin' longevity until I'm seventy
Livin' heavenly, fuck, felony after felony, what?
Nigga you broke, what the fuck you going to tell me?
[Outro: Maria Davis & JAY-Z]
Jay-Z, Jay-Z, now you know this is a phat track (aight)
Now this is comin' on your new album, on Roc-A-Fella records in '96?
(No doubt, no doubt)
Well, it is definitely the bomb! But you know I do wanna say somethin' to you, I know you've been havin' a lot of problems with the law
But I know you innocent, and I'm behind you 100%
Mad Wednesdays, Ruby King, DJ Ace, Dame Dash, Roc-A-Fella Records, we all behind you, you can come back any time!
(Hah, thanks a lot)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, Ace, turn that music down. I smell some reefer, now you see? That's why, our people don't have anything, because we don't know how to go in places and act properly
(Hey, shut the fuck up!)
Wait a minute, wait a minute, who told me shut the eff up? Who told me to shut the eff up? Get him out of here! I'm not gonna continue this show, until you throw him out! Get him out right now, then I'ma continue my speech!
Thank you, he's out of here now, now like I was sayin'... we gotta build our own businesses, we gotta get our own record companies goin' like Roc-A-Fella Records, we got to put money back into our own community...15Embed"

But really, I don't need the heat (Nah)
Your heart pump project Kool-Aid, you're sweet (Nigga)
I don't gotta two-way, you gays
This is not beef, this is rap, homie; I don't have a scratch on me
You feel Jay soft, rip Jay off
Damn, I'm only worth over a hundred million
Look, I got beef with, like, a hundred children
Niggas with pink suits (Faggot) tryna get cute (Ha)
You a little out of line homie, don't let the nine, homie
Put you out your mind, homie, just rhyme, homie
Kick your little lies, I kick my real facts
Like you sneaking out the back of that Source Soundlab, ha (Pew!)
We wasn't chasing you (Nah), we had a taping, too
We came through to do our one-two thing (Check, what's up)
It wasn't a Roc-a-Fella come-through thing
'Cause if it was on like that, I would come through Queens
With Queens niggas—you know how I do
Look, I got more shooters in Queensbridge than you (Tah)
Niggas'll tie you up on the Colosseum roof
And open beer bottles off the boy chipped tooth (Ping!)

Had to buy your chain back last time you got robbed (Goddamn)
The nerve of this coward nigga, oh my God
And I don't rap rumors or innuendos
I bring it to you live, lift up your window
Let the public peek in, see your dirty laundry
Y'all don't want me to continue, ho!

With me and sleeps between the sheets

Me and the boy A.I. got more in common
Than just balling and rhyming—get it? ""More in Carmen""
I came in your Bentley backseat (Damn)
Skeeted in your Jeep (Woo)
Left condoms on your baby-seat (Woo)
Here, nigga—the gloves is off, the love is done
It's whatever, whenever, however, nigga (One!)
And since you infatuated with saying that gay shit (Faggot)
Yes, you was kissing my dick when you was kissing that bitch (Oh)
Nasty shit, you thought I was boning Renette
You calling Carm' a hundred times, I was boning her neck
You got a baby by the broad, you can't disown her yet
When does your lies end? When does the truth begin?
When does reality set in, or does it not matter?
Gotta hurt: I'm your baby mama's favorite rapper (Haha)
And ask your current girl, she know what's up
Holla at a real nigga! Jigga! (I don't give a fuck!)

I got bail money, double-XL money
You got flash now, but time will reveal money
I spit the hottest shit, you need it I got it shit
That down-South, Master P, Bout It Bout It shit
I got blood money, straight up thug money
That brown paper bag under your mattress drug money

Where's all the ice with all the platinum under that?
Those ain't Rolex diamonds, what the fuck you done to that?
Y'all rapping-ass niggas, y'all funny to me
You're selling records being you, but still you wanna be me
I guess for every buck you make it's like a hundred for me
And still you running around thinking you got something on me
But I done did it
And y'all want to take my flow, and run with it
That's cool, I was the first one with it
Origin-al, Jigga's the future, flow digit-al

But this year I've done it again, Jigga! What the fuck?
Nigga stop whining, Jigga, still shining
Niggas kept complaining so I copped more diamonds
Rock more Versace, ain't nothing sweet
I still throw t'ree in your body, fleeing the party
Y'all can't go with me, nope, flow with me
Bet 50, not dollars either I brought some dough with me
I flow like the 5 Series, in various areas
And blow holes in your weak niggas theories
It's funny how one verse can fuck up the game

Blessed me with some VS
Somethings I can live with: stop frontin'
And for the dough I raise, gotta get shit appraised
No disrespect to you, make sure your word is true
I'm takin' wages down in Vegas just in case Tyson
Have a major night off, that's clean money, the tax write-off
You ain't seen money in your life, when it
Comes to this cheese y'all like Three Blind Mice

Suckin' me in like a vacuum, I remember
Tellin' my family: ""I'll be back soon""; that was December
'85 and Jay-Z rise 10 years later
Got me wise still can't break my underworld ties
I wear black a lot, in the Ac', act a lot
Got matchin' VCR's, a huge Magnavox
Ten inch, green like spinach, pop wines that's vintage
It's a lot of big money in my sentence
Hittin' towards a mil', lip a, written I kill like that

See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""Don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94, 'bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and Illmatic rocked
Outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, I'm still stretching on the block
Like ""Damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is
Guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

[Verse 2: Beanie Sigel]
Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking damn; how my older sister going make me tougher
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in The Source is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
'Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that Akki, 'fore I send shots though your body
Make 'em feel hell on earth before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nutting more can stop me
'Til them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mack not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, gotta teach 'em that before I leave, dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave, dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it, I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning?
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
[Verse 3: Scarface]
Life.. yeah.. uhh..
Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two
Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Loving your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homie, he in the midst.. of good company
Who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be with your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life...24Embed"

I been crushing the building since Izod socks
I'm so independent, sh..I might buy Koch
I might not stop
Places to cop, seventy-six floors, you can call me the Doc
Say when, say when
(When!)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire
Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired
Build me up, break me down to build me up again
They like: ""Hov, we need you back so we can kill your ass again""
""Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close""
How I'm 'posed to win? they got me fightin' ghosts
Same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with
Sh.., Thats' only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
You see Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas; see Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
If you succeed, prepare to be crucified
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough bein' Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now
Now the question is, is to have had and lost
Better than not having at [all]
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Everybody wanna be the King then shots ring
You layin' on your balcony with holes in your dream
Or you Malcolm X-d out, get distracted by screams
Everybody get your hand off my jeans
Everybody look at you strange, say you changed
Uhh! Like you work that hard to stay the same
Uhh! Game stays the same, the name changes
So its best for those to not overdose on being famous
Most kings get driven so insane
That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did
No dangers, so shameless
Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers
Low chain 'em as the enemies approach
So raise your draw bridge and drown them in the moat
And the Spirit I'm evoking
Hold on

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Everybody screaming they want the old Hov
But the new improved Hov hit like Albert Pujols
Everybody wanna hear me talk that money like Phil Rizzuto
But my mind is on Pluto
Bills that I do fold, I now invest on
Trying to find some loopholes in the IRS
As where I used to have a few hoes, I am just
Concentrating on making a new Hov through sex
I've awakened just in time to school those putos
Trying to follow in my shoes with jewels froze
Better adhere to this text 'fore you go
Broke, spending more than you've accrued on silly baguettes
I know silly begets silly you'll learn on your own
At least my conscience is clear, I'm no longer steering you wrong
Ain't nothing wrong with baguettes after you get a home
Take care of your home, you can go back and—ugh!
[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I'm getting courted by the bosses
The Edgars And Doug Morris-es-es
Jimmy I's and Lyors-es -- it's
Gotta be more than the choruses
They respecting my mind now
Just a matter of time now
Operation: Takeover Corporate
Makeover offices-es-es then takeover all of it
Please may these words be recorded
To serve as testimony that I saw it all before it
Came to fruition, sort of a premonition
Uncontrollable hustler's ambition
Alias Superstition, like Stevie
The writing's on the wall like my lady, right baby?
Saw it all before, some of y'all thought I was crazy, maybe
Like a fox, I'm cagey, ah-ah
The more successful, the more stressful
The more and more I transform to Gordon Gekko
In the race to a billion got my face to the ceiling
Got my knees on the floor, please Lord forgive him
Has he lost his religion, is the greed gon' get him?
He's having heaven on earth, will his wings still fit him?
I got the Forbes on my living room floor
And I'm still talking to the poor, nigga I want more
TIME's most influential, was impressive
'Specially since I wasn't in the artist section
Had me with the builders and the titans
Had me right with Rupert Murdoch
Billionaire boys and some dudes you never heard of
Word up on Madison Ave is I'm a cash cow
Word down on Wall Street, homie, you get the cash out
IPO Hov, no need for reverse merger
The boy money talk no need to converse further
The baby blue Maybach like I own Gerber

Gather 'round, hustlers, that's if you still livin'
And get on down to that ol' Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers, I'm back, motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov, what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops, so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude, he's Teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred
I'm not guilty, now give me back my bread
Mr. District Attorney, I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to?
Plus - Hov don't run, Hov stand and fight
Hov a soldier, Hov been fightin' all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me? Fuck you, what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin' back
I'm representin' for the seat where Rosa Parks sat
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped (Come on)
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro

Well, in these times, well, at least to me
There's a lot of rappers out there tryin' to sound like Jay-Z
I'll help you out, here's what you do
You gonna need a wide lens 'cause that's a ver' big shoe
And you got a couple of beans and you don't have a clue?
Your situation is bleek, I'ma keep it real 'cause
Fuckin' with me, you gotta drop a mil'
'Cause if you gonna cop somethin', you gotta cop for real
Don't only talk it, walk like it, from the bricks to the booth
I could predict the future like Cleo the psychic
You can't date skeeos and wife it (Uh-uh)
And you can't sell me bullshit, we know the prices
So what your life is?

Uh-huh
That's right
It was all good just a week ago
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago
Last week I had everything
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago
I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago
And the jewelry..
And then my motherfuckin' niggas started snitchin'
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo, yo
Beatch!
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Growin' up in the hood, just my dog and me
We used to hustle in the hood for all to see
Problems; I called on him, he called on me
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P
Let him unlock doors off my keys
Yeah, we spoke, much more than cordially
Man, he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed
Used to call me from the joint 'til he ran out of change
And when he called collect and I heard his name
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone
He's talkin' reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone
I said: ""Damn, dog! What, nine weeks and you're home?""
He said: ""Main man, you think shit's sweet 'cause you're home.""
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone
Them crackers up there bleachin' your dome, you're reachin'
I said: ""The world don't stop, I got to keep..keep on.""
From there I sensed the beef was on
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone
Can't be too safe, ‘cause niggas is two-faced
And they show the other side, when they catch a new case
It's on
[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell
We both came in this game, blind as hell
I did a little better, had more clientele
Told you put away some cheddar, now you cryin' for bail
Seventeen and I'm holdin' on to around a mill'
I could bail out, blow trial and come around on appeal
Had niggas thinkin' I was from uptown for real
I had so much hustle, plus I was down to ill
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville
Down and dirty, down to fight to round 30
Freezin' on them corners, still holdin' my crack
Lookin' up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?
Came from flat broke to lettin' the dough stack
You tell them Feds I said: ""I'm never going back""
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious
[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks

Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin' some things
All this after a week in the bing
I'm mad at myself, 'cause I didn't spot the weakling
I would've bet the house you wouldn't speak a thing
Nigga, this was the oath, to the top or broke
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us
We supposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry (that's right)
The same game that make you math could make you die
(That's life) It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap
Who would've thought you'd get popped one time and rat?
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad
And your son gotta grow up, like, ""This is my dad?""
The labeling of a snitch is a lifetime scar
You'll always be in jail, nigga, just minus the bars
[Chorus: Too $hort + Jay-Z]
It was cool when you had hella weed to smoke
And you bought a new home where you could keep the folks
I don't see how this side of you could be provoked
Uh-huh, uh-huh, it was all good just a week ago
Funny what seven days can change
A stand up nigga, now you sit down to aim
Used to have a firm grip, now you dropping names
It was all good just a week ago

[Outro: Too $hort]
Shit is crazy man
All these niggas out here snitchin'
We was one step away from takin' this crack money
And recyclin' it through the ghettos
And buildin' back up our own hoods
Now all you niggas start snitchin' on each other
I got partners doin' 15-20
Wouldn'ta been doin' SHIT
If you didn't snitch, beatch!
It's about time y'all check that shit out man
It ain't all good, shut your mouth
Just watch the game
And don't snitch
We'd sure go a lot whole further
Believe that baby

Got it goin' on

Am I frightenin' ya? Shall I continue?
I put the gun to ya, I let it sing you a song
I let it hum to ya, the other one sing along
Now it's a duet and you wet when you check out
The technique from the two TECs and I don't need two lips
To blow this like a trumpet, you dumb shit
This is a unusual musical, I conduct it
You lookin' at the Black Warren Buffett
So all critics can duck sick
I don't care if you C. Delores Tuck-it
Or you Bill O'Reilly, you only rilin' me up
For three years, they had me peein' out of a cup
Now they 'bout to free me up, what you think I'm gon' be, what?
Rehabilitated? Man, I still feel hatred
I'm young, Black and rich so they wanna strip me naked, but
You'll never have me like Christina Aguiler-y
But catch me down the Westside, drivin' like Halle Berry
Or the FDR, in the seat of my car
Screamin' out the sunroof, ""Death to y'all""
You can't kill me, I live forever through these bars
I put the wolves on ya, I put a price on your head
The whole hood'll want ya, you startin' to look like bread
I send them boys at ya, I ain't talkin' 'bout feds

But look at us now man, we're young execs

But these streets raised me crazy
Product of my environment, nothing can save me
Thanks for letting me bloom, for your wisdom, for your womb
For the roof over my head, for my shoes, for my bed
For the most important lesson in life was when you said
""Strive for what you believe in, set goals and you can achieve them""
Thanks for the days you kept me breathing
When my asthma was bad and my chest was wheezin'
Thanks for the look of love just as I was leaving
On nights you thought that I wouldn't come back, that left you grieving
Thanks for holdin' down the household when times was bad
As a man, I apologize for my dad
When the rent was due, you would hustle like a pimp would do
That wasn’t the life meant for you
You’re a queen, you deserve the cream, everything that gleamed
Everything that shines, everything that’s mine

Because you're the biggest target out there, right?
When everyone's on the court, they're coming for you
When the opposing player walks into that arena
They're thinkin of upstaging you
You're, you're like a trophy to them
They're thinkin' ""if I'm better than this guy
The spotlight turns on me""
So, you know you're a superstar because you're a marked man
And everyone's coming for you

[Run DMC sample]
The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king (king)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z (Chris Martin)]
Inspired by Basquiat, my chariot's on fire
Everybody took shots, hit my body up, I'm tired
Build me up to break me down to build me up again
They like ""Hov', we need you back so we can kill your ass again""
Hov got flow though he's no Big and Pac, but he's close
How I'm 'posed to win? They got me fighting ghosts
Most kings (... get their heads cut off)
With the same sword they knight you they gon' good night you with
Shit, that's only half if they like you
That ain't even the half what they might do
Don't believe me, ask Michael
See Martin, see Malcolm
See Biggie, see Pac, see success and its outcome
See Jesus, see Judas
See Caesar, see Brutus
See success is like suicide
Suicide, it's a suicide
When you succeed, prepare to be crucified, uhh
Media meddles, niggas sue you, you settle
Every step you take, they remind you you ghetto
So it's tough being Bobby Brown
To be Bobby then, you gotta be Bobby now
Now the question is, ""Is to have had and lost
Better than not having at all?""
Because dawg
[Chorus: Chris Martin & Run DMC sample]
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Most kings get their heads cut off
The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Uhh, everybody wanna be the king then shots ring
You laying on your balcony with holes in your dream
Or you Malcolm X-d out, get distracted by screams
Everybody get your hand off my jeans
Everybody look at you strange, say you changed
Like you work that hard to stay the same, uhh
Game stays the same, the name changes
So it's best for those to not overdose on being famous
Most kings get driven so insane
That they try to hit the same vein that Kurt Cobain did
So dangerous, so no strangers
Invited to the inner sanctum of your chambers
Load chambers, the enemy's approaching
So raise your draw bridge and drown 'em in the moat
Then, spirit I'm evoking
There's kings who've been awoken
From shots from those who was most close to them
They won't stop until you ghost to 'em
But real kings don't die
They become martyrs, let's toast to 'em
King Arthur, put a robe to him
Like James Brown, no the show ain't over
Until Rome's ruined
'Til the republic is overthrown
'Til my loyal subjects is over Hov'
Long live the king, no, the reign won't stop
They want my head on the chopping block
I won't die, nah
[Chorus: Chris Martin, Jay-Z & Run DMC sample]
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on coming if they ready or not
Long live the king, know the reign won't stop
The, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be
Long live the, the, the king
They wanna be the, the, the king
They wanna be
Most kings get their heads cut off
Keep on climbing 'til you reach the top
Keep on coming if they ready or not8Embed"

[Intro: Pain In Da Ass]
Somebody's pulling me closer to the ground
I ain't panicked, I been here before
Seems like only yesterday when I got up on that stage
In front of that crowd
And showed them who was who, and what was what
Man look at these suckers
I ain't no rapper, I'm a hustler
It just so happens that I know how to rap
OKAY, I'M RELOADED!
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
A million

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
Uh-huh, I did it again niggas
Fucked up, right? Ha, I know
I know what y'all niggas asking yourself
Is he gon' ever fall off?
No...

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
... A lot of speculation
On the monies I've made, honies I've slayed
How is he for real? Is that nigga really paid?
Hustlers I've met or, dealt with direct
Is it true he stayed in beef and slept with a TEC?
What's the position you hold?
Can you really match a triple platinum artist buck by buck
But only a single goin' gold?
If Roc-A-Fella should fold, and you're left out in the cold
Is it back to charging motherfuckers 11 for an O?
For the millionth time, asking me questions
Like Wendy Williams, harassing me
Then get upset when I catch feelings
Can I get a minute to breathe? And in that minute you leave
While I'm looking at my Rol' ice spinning on my sleeve
Ugh, nice watch, do you really have a spot?
Like you said in Friend or Foe and if so, what block?
What you doin in L.A., with Filipinos and Eses?
Latinos and Chevys, down by Pico with Frederico
I'll answer all your questions but then y'all got to go
Now the question I ask you is, ""How bad you wanna know?""
BLAOW!
[Chorus: Aaliyah]
A million

[Break: Jay-Z]
Roc-A-Fella y'all, uhh, uh
Know my style

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Motherfuckers can't rhyme no more, 'bout crime no more
'Til I'm no more, 'cause I'm so raw
My flow expose holes that they find in yours
Wasn't for me, niggas still be dying for whores
But I hate when a nigga sit back, admiring yours
Young blood, you better get that, we frying because
Niggas don't want to be confined to riding the iron horse
And don't listen to the rappers yo, they dying to floss
I used to be O.T., applyin' the force
Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss
Come back with the clique playing Diana Ross
I'm the boss and this is how it's gon' be
Burnt the turnpike, wild miles on the V
I got mouths to feed 'til they put flowers on me
And kiss my cold cheek, chicks crying like I was Cochise
Tombstone read, ""He was holdin' no leaks""
Started from the crack game and then so sweet
Freaked it to the rap game, Jigga the O.G
On MTV, telling 'em how I sold D
And used to bag work up out of apartment 4-B
Me and my homie, started out co-d's
Picked the mailbox lock 'cause I ain't have no key
Had the cable with the anchor when Jaz made 'Sophie'
Then I went low key, but now I'm back, it's on
Motherfuckers!

Gotta keep a peace like a Buddhist

[Intro: Jay-Z]
Ugh, ugh, yessir!
Just the sound of his voice is a hit, hehe
Y'all niggas got me really confused out there
I make ""Big Pimpin'"" or ""Give It 2 Me,"" one of those, y'all hail me as the greatest writer of the 21st century
I make some thought-provoking shit, y'all question whether he fallin' off
I'ma really confuse y'all on this one
Follow!

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
When them tops come down, chicks' tops come down
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around
When them blocks come out, I can wake up a small town
Finish off the block, then I make my mall rounds
Stares get exchanged, then the fifth come out
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out
""That's him!""—I'm usually what they whisper 'bout
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount
'Cause I been doing this since CHiPs was out
Watchin' Erik Estrada, baggin' up at the Ramada
Table full of powder, A/C broke
'Bout to take another shower on my 25th Hour
Spike Lees everywhere, game or the flight
You might see me anywhere, a day in the life
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight
I can touch down and take off the same night
I'm so bossy, bitch, get off me
Trick, get off me, you can't get shit off me
I'm so flossy, no sixes on Sprees
Laid-back, Maybachs, don't even talk to me
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
This is that ignorant shit you like
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus ice, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you love
Nigga, fuck, shit, maricón, puta, and drugs, c'mon
I got that ignorant shit you need
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, trick, plus weed, c'mon
I'm only tryna give you what you want
Nigga, fuck, shit, ass, bitch, you like it—don't front!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
They're all actors
Lookin' at themselves in the mirror backwards
Can't even face themselves
Don't fear no rappers
They're all weirdos, De Niros in practice
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures
It's mostly backwards
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me
And everything said in song, you happen to see
Then, actually, believe half of what you see
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me
And with that said, I will kill niggas dead
Cut niggas short, give you wheels for legs
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R, see y'all in Hell
Shoot niggas straight through the ER, whoa!
This ain't B.R., no
It's S.C., CEO, the next Lyor
No, the next leader of the whole free world
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel—go!
[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
Ugh, take off the cuffs, unlock the gate
It's that ignorant nigga that you love to hate
The '07 Ice Cube, B. Sig' so rude
Tell a trick, get these nuts, eat dick like food
Now see if I care if this verse get aired
Even if you mute it, the curse is there, yeah
I'm so raunchy, bitch, get off me
Keep my flea collar on, you lil' ticks get off me

[Verse 4: Jay-Z]
I missed the part when it stopped bein' 'bout Imus
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit?
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Are you saying what I'm spittin' is worse than these celebretantes showin' they kitten? You kiddin'?
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin'
Scarface the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me
Still that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me
Let's stop the bullshittin'
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin', c'mon

Mama loved me, pop left me
Mickey fed me, Annie dressed me
Eric fought me, made me tougher
Love you for that, my nigga, no matter what, bruh
Marcy raised me, and whether right or wrong
Streets gave me all I write in this song
Hootie babysitted, changed my diapers
Gil introduced me to the game that changed my life up
East Trenton grew me, had me skipping school
Valencia's boyfriend Volvo had me making moves
Mama raised me, pop, I miss you
God, help me forgive him, I got some issues
Mickey cleaned my ears, Annie shampooed my hair
Eric was fly, shit, I used to steal his gear
I was the baby boy, I could do no wrong
Years going past fast, let's move along
Kitchen table, that's where I honed my skills
Jaz made me believe this shit was real
Labels turned me down, couldn't foresee
Clark sought me out, Dame believed
Primo laced me, Ski did too
Reasonable Doubt, classic, shoulda went triple
Mama loved me, pop left me
Grandma dressed me, plus, she fed me
Banana pudding was in the hood then
Puffing on L's, drinking pink Champale
Ty rolled with a nigga, V.A. spot
Tone, Mike 'Zo and them niggas, V.A.'s locked
Biggs fucked with a nigga, what's up, Hoff?
Bee-High hated the fact I put rap to the back
Money pouring in, clientele growing now
Birth of my first nephew, time to slow it down
October 21st, Lavelle came to the world
Followed by three more boys and then a baby girl
Mama loved me, Ti-Ti, Uncle Jay
Loves you to death, won't let no trouble come your way
Oh, can't forget my man down in Maryland
He's gone 'til November, how can I not remember?
Tell your moms I'm there for her and Tiembra
And your son, too, it's nothing I won't do
Unless you was me, how could you judge me?
I was brought up in pain, y'all can't touch me
Police pursued me, chased, cuffed, and subdued me
Talked to me rudely 'cause I'm young, rich, and I'm Black and living a movie, not living by rules
New rap patrolling the city, follow my crews
Bleek, you're still with me, nigga, what did I say?
Your time is coming, you one hit away
Beans, I ain't tryna change you, just give you some game
To make the transition from the street to the fame

I keep it fresher than the next, bitch
No need for you to ever sweat the next bitch
With speed, I make the best bitch see the exit, indeed
You gotta know you're thoroughly respected by me
You get the keys to the Lexus with no driver
You got your own '96 somethin' to ride
And keep your ass tight up in Versace, that's why
You gotta watch your friends, you got to watch me, they connivin'
Shit, the first chance to crack the bank, they try me
All they get is 50 cent franks and papayas
From the village to the telly
Time to kill it on your belly no question
Had more black chicks between my sheets than Essence
They say sex is a weapon
So when I shoot, meet your death in less than 8 seconds
Still poundin' in my afterlife
Laughin', my shit is tight, who you askin', right?

Into a don, flippin' weight, Her-on and shit

Tailor-made so we can lay up in the shade reminiscin'
On how I fuck the best and shit
Especially when I'm sippin' Baileys
Don't give a fuck about how you move with them other mamis
I push the Z, eatin' shrimp scampi with rocks larger than life
Fuck them Reebok broads, you made it known who your wife was
I got you frontin' in Armani sweaters
Before this rap shit, when you was in leathers and bullshit Berettas
And E classes with Mo in the glasses
Shows in Cali with all the flavor suede Bally's
Now all your mens is up in your Benz's
High post, I swear you be killin' me, playin' inside my pubic hairs
I never worry about them other chicks
'Cause you proved who was your wiz
When you was spendin' that bitch
I took a little when you was up north, your commissary stay pilin'
How you livin' large on the island?
All them collects have me vexed, but when you come home
Knew I was comin' off with half of them checks

Mean bucket (Uh-huh)
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets (Yeah)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need
That new coupe (Got that)
A durag and a pocket full of loot (Got those)
A sunny day, some chicks that wanna play
And I'll be on my way, listen

[Verse 3]
The cream too long, my team too strong
Bleek is too hot, Beans is gone
Y'all niggas in the crosshair, the beams is on (See y'all)
Your whole block deserted, y'all fiends are gone (Bye-bye)
The whole Roc is jumpin', we reached our zenith
Got fiends throwin' up on themself like Willie Beamen (Haha)
Any given Sunday, gunplay's optional
However niggas want it like Soul II Soul (However do you want it?)
Whoever got hops get blocked, go to the hole
Dikembe Mutumbo of this rap shit
Plus the jab is sick, and it's Zab quick
Left hand'll lean 'em like a little past six
Now run along with your little-ass hits
Read my rap sheet, nigga, three classics
Shut your bumba', I got A-Rod numbers
All you muddaskunks get buried in the trunk
When I blast the pump, I leave you relaxed
In the hospital, lookin' at M*A*S*H for months
Then I dumps dough on the D.A. desk
And I flee scot-free and pee-pee on the steps
We's got no respect
No law or governin', why you fuckin' with him?
Matter fact, why you fuckin' with them?
All y'all need is the R-O-C, baby
[Chorus]
All I need
Rocawear (Check)
Nike Airs (Right)
Mean bucket (Check)
Armadale in the club, couple of duckets (Uh)
Couple chicks by my side, let's ride
All I need
That new coupe (Got that)
A durag and a pocket full of loot (Got those)
A sunny day, some chicks that wanna play
And I'll be on my way, listen

Thank you, thank you very much for coming out this evening

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines

[Verse 1]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, please hold your applause
For I just applied logic—keys, keys open doors
Now I'm balcony, opera, black tux, binocular
Black Luxe, stop it, I shouldn't be so popular
Name keep poppin' up, face keep poppin' up
On the tube, I'm just watchin' Pacquaio box 'em up
How would I know HBO would get a shot of us?
Sittin' so close that we almost got snot on us
Please don't bow in my presence—how am I a legend?
I just got ten #1 albums, maybe now eleven?
More hits than a Now 11; that is no reason
To treat me like I'm somehow from outta heaven
Heaven knows that I've made my mistakes
Thank God, what a guy, as I say my grace!
Who woulda thought by makin' birds migrate for the winter
I be fly all summer? Might I say

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines
[Verse 2]
Hovi baby, we are really high, really high tonight
We tip the waiter a hundred dollars to keep the ice cold, alright
We the last ones to keep the wise guys code alive
If I can't live by my word, then I'd much rather die
No no, don't thank me, this is just how my suit is stitched
I'm cut from a different cloth, I'm just who the shoe fits
For The Color of Money like a Tom Cruise flick
'Cept I put eight balls in corners without usin' pool sticks
Beautiful music when champagne flutes click, eh
Beautiful women sippin' through rouge lips, eh
Dangers approaches, we're like: ""Wait, who's this?""
Let us save you some trouble, son, what size suit you is?
This way after the Ruger shoots through a few clips
You can lay in your casket just as you is
We appreciate the target practices
We'll be sure to send flower baskets, kid

[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Verse 3]
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
I was gon' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales
I was gon' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help
And they did a good job, them boys is talented as hell
'Cause not only did they brick, they put a building up as well
Then ran a plane into that building and when that building fell
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar, then took a smell
'Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills
Niggas thought they was ill, found out they was ILL
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel
[Refrain]
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Hold your applause, this is your song, not mines
Thank you, thank you, thank you, you're far too kind
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors, I'll handle mines

[Outro]
We are really high, really really high, no
Really really high, really high tonight, ha
We are really high, really high tonight
We are really high, really high tonight

Stress...
Sunshine, shade, geyeah

[Verse 1]
I sold it all, from crack to opium
In third person, I don't wanna see 'em
So I'm rehearsin' with my peoples how to G 'em
From a remote location in the BM
Scopin' the whole situation, like, ""Damn!""
Metamorphic, as the dope turns to cream
But one of these buyers got eyes like a Korean
It's difficult to read 'em
The windows to his soul were half closed, I put the key in
Pulled off slow, hopin' my people fleein'
Chink tried to knock the only link that tied me in
Coppers was watchin' us through nighttime binoculars
This time they got us on tape, exchangin' dope for dollars
Make me wanna holler back at the crib in the sauna
Prayin' my people bailed out like Time/Warner
Awaitin' a call, from his kin, not the coroner
Phone in my hand, nervous confined to a corner
Beads of sweat, second thoughts on my mind
How can I ease the stress and learn to live with these regrets?
(This time, stress, givin' this shit up, fuck)
[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

[Verse 2]
As sure as this Earth is turnin', souls burnin'
In search of higher learnin'
Turnin' in every direction, seekin' direction
My mom's cryin', because her insides are dyin'
Her son tryin' her patience, keep her heart racin'
A million beats a minute, I know I push you to your limit
But it's this game Love, I'm caught up all in it
They make it, so you can't prevent it, never give it
You gotta take it, can't fake it, I keep it authentic
My hand got this pistol shakin'
'Cause I sense danger like Camp Crystal Lake and
Don't wanna shoot him, but I got him
Trapped, within this infrared dot
About to hot him and hit rock bottom
No answers to these trick questions, no time, shit's stressin'
My life found I got to live for the right now
Time waits for no man, can't turn back the hands
Once it's too late, gotta learn to live with regrets
[Chorus 2]
You used to hold me, told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
(When I was young) you used to hold me
Told me that I was the best
Anything in this world I want I could possess
All that made me want is all that I could get
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
[Verse 3]
I found myself reminiscin', remember this one?
When he was here he was crazy nice with his, son
I miss him, long as I'm livin' he's livin' through memories
He's there to kill all my suicidal tendencies
In heaven lookin' over me, or in hell keepin' it cozy
I'm comin', life on these streets ain't what it's supposed to be
Remember Newton, mutual friend?
Well, me and him feudin', on your life I tried to talk to him
But you know niggas, think they guns can stop four niggas
Frontin' like they're Big Willie but really owe niggas
Hoe niggas, this year I'll show niggas — think I'm slippin'?
I'm about to send you a roommate, no bullshittin'
But my hustle's goin' too well to hit him
You was right, niggas want you to be miserable with them
Anyway, I ain't tryin' to hear it, I think I'm touched
This whole verse I been talkin' to your spirit a little too much
[Chorus 1]
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
If through our travels we get separated, never forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
On the rise to the top many drop, don't forget
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets
This is the number one rule for your set
In order to survive, gotta learn to live with regrets

It's the Dynasty, niggas
As promised
The world's most infamous, Roc-A-Fella Records
This is Roc La Familia
It's Young Hova
Beanie Sigel
Memphis Bleek
Amil-lion
It's the Dynasty, niggas

Check it out
Ugh, walk with me, talk to me, yo

[Verse]
The theme song to The Sopranos
Plays in the key of life on my mental piano
Got a strange way of seeing life, like
I'm Stevie Wonder with beads under the do-rag
Intuition is there, even when my vision's impaired, yeah
Knowing I can go just switching a spare
On the highway of life, nigga, it's sharp in my sight, oh!
Keen senses ever since I was a teen on the benches
Every time somebody like Ennis was mentioned
I would turn green—me, being in the trenches
Him, living adventurous, not worrying about expenditures
I'm braving temperatures below zero, no hero
No father figure; you gotta pardon a nigga
But I'm starving, my niggas, and the weight loss in my figure
Is starting to darken my heart, 'bout to get to my liver
Watch it, my niggas; I'm trying to be calm but I'm gon' get richer
Through any means with that thing that Malcolm palmed in the picture
Never read the Qur'an or Islamic scriptures
Only Psalms I read was on the arms of my niggas
Tattooed, so I carry on like I'm nonreligious
Clap whoever stand between Shawn and figures
Niggas say it's the dawn, but I'm superstitious
Shit is as dark as it's been, nothing has gone as you predicted
I move with biscuits, stop the heart of niggas acting too suspicious
This is food for thought—you do the dishes!13Embed"

Ayo, Jay, word up
These motherfuckers fucking talking
That comeback shit like they cooking crack
Shit, I ain't fronting
All I want my pockets green like slum change
You know what I'm saying?
Front the roll we roll back like rubbers, motherfucker, for real
With no trace of AIDS
We keep our pockets fully blown
Roc-A-Fella clique, nigga
[Verse 1: Sauce Money]
Ayo, we patting down pussy from Sugar Hill to the Shark Bar
Fuck a bitch D in the marked car
We got the bad bitches gasping for air in Aspen
Searching for Aspirin when I ascend, we swing
You cling, we do our thing and bring
Slinging your ding-a-ling from Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn to Beijing
East coast host is hostile colossal
Money flaring like nostrils for drug dealing apostles, huh
Al Pacino down to Nino Brown
Me, Jay and Preemo, got it sewed across the board like Pokeno
Teflon, make sure your jammy is full
'Cause I heard, Sammy the Bull lamps in Miami with pull
Tropical leaves where I got a few keys
With my man I'll stock a few G's, now it's unstoppable cheese
Said we was garbage, so fuck college
Street knowledge amazing to scholars when we coin phrases for dollars
Star studded bitches with crystals
Get fucked with pistols, just to see my shit, discharge puss
I drop the stellar, even acapella
I got to tell all about Roc-A-Fella

[Chorus: Fat Joe sample]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Mannerisms of a young Bobby DeNiro, spent Spanish wisdoms
In a whip with dinero, crime organized like the Pharoahe
I cream, I diamond gleam
High post like Hakeem, got a lot of things to drop
Brooklyn to Queens, I gotta keep my steam
Niggas wanna try to hem my long jeans
Uptown fiend for Jay-Z to appear on the scene
In the meanwhile, here's something dope for y'all to lean
Liaison for days on end
Money make the world go around so I made some to spend
Can I live, did dough with my nigs, dividends flow
Like the Mississippi Riv', looking jig
Can't do for dolo, had to turn away when Tony killed Manolo
That's real, mixed feelings like a mulatto
Thug thought he was O.G. Bobby Johnson
I played him like Benny Blanco, mano a mano
You ain't ready, I fondle trigger straight up, shoot my guns
Horizontal, get your weight up, I am
Two point two pounds
You're barely a hundred and twenty five grams
Wouldn't expect y'all to understand this money
Do the knowledge, due to few dollars, I'm due to demolish
Crews Brooklyn through Hollis to a hood near you, what the fuck?

[Chorus: Fat Joe sample]
Bring it on if you think you can hang
[Verse 3: Big Jaz]
Money is power, I'm energetic with facial credit
Pure platinum fetish for cheddars
Spread lettuce, heroes get deadish
I make moves that remove pebbles out of shoes
You suck pistol like pipe with the crystal
John Stockton couldn't assist you
Convoys of Benzes like we fouling in the U.N
So what the fuck you doing? Whatever, nigga
Fahrvergnügen, rugged yet polished
Spanking dollars with the commas
Banging bitches out the Bahamas
On hides of llama we cry nada, fly farther
Fry hotter, you die gotta, fuck with me witness mañana
Absence of malice in my palace
Call cousin now Dallas trigger finger with the callus
Tip scales from mail to keep these niggas off balance
Your frequent stops to O.T.B. you feeding me
Steam a nigga scheming on the wrist action with the gleams
Jewels for Pop Duke fulfill your dreams
Never put the pure brown sugar before the dirty green cream

[Chorus: Fat Joe sample]
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing
Yeah, bring it on if you think you can hang

Uhh, she wants that old thing back
Uh, uh, uh

She fiends for me nightly

Morning, she rush for my touch
This is about lust
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her
My presence is a must- must- must-
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on
If I didn't when we cutting, the feeling'll be too strong
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams

That Black Rain will take away your pain
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein

Like Louboutins with the red bottoms
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em

It's so much fun, you shun therapy
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting
Shopping's like copping, you constantly need it
I'm never around, you constantly seek it
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps
I keep trying to remind you to keep telling yourself
Now your conscience is interfering, like ""Better yourself!""
Like you better get help
But when that medicine's felt
We're back together, don't ever leave me
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me

How could you leave me?
I thought that you needed me!
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me
Who helped you immediately? How speedy of me!

And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me

Geah, yeah
Life is but a dream to me, I don't wanna wake up
Thirty odd years without having my cake up
So I'm about my paper 24/7, 365, 366 in a leap year
I don't know why we here
Since we gotta be here life is but a beach ch-ch-ch-chair
Went from having shabby clothes, crossing over Abbey Road
Hear my angels singing to me (Are you happy, Hov?)
I just hope I'm hearing right; karma's got me fearing life
Colleek, are you praying for me?
See I got demons in my past, so I got daughters on the way
If the prophecy's correct, then the child should have to pay
For the sins of a father, so I barter my tomorrows
Against my yesterdays in hopes that she'll be okay
And when I'm no longer here to shade her face from the glare
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter and a new beach chair

Life is but a dream to me
Gun shots sing to these other guys
But lullabies don't mean a thing to me
I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid of not trying
Every day, hit every wave like I'm Hawaiian
I don't surf the net, no, I never been on MySpace
Too busy letting my voice vibrate
Carving out my space in this world of fly girls
Cut-throats and diamond-cut ropes I twirls
Benzes 'round corners where the sun don't shine
I let the wheels give a glimpse of hope of one's grind
Son said: ""Hov, how you get so fly?""
I said: ""From not being afraid to fall out the sky""
My physical's a shell, so when I say farewell
My soul will find a even higher plane to dwell
So fly, you shall, so have no fear
Just know that life is but a beach chair

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Life is but a dream
Can't mimic my life, I'm the thinnest cut slice
Intercut, the winner's cup
With winters rough enough to interrupt life
That's why I'm both saint and sinner, nice
This is Jay everyday, no compromise
No compass comes with this life, just eyes
So to map it out, you must look inside
Sure, books could guide you, but your heart defines you, chica
Your corazón is what brought us home
In great shape like Heidi Klum, maricón
I am on permanent vacay, life is but a beach chair
This song's like a Hallmark card until you reach here
So 'til she's here, and she's declared
The heir, I will prepare
A blueprint for you to print, a map for you to get back
A guide for your eyes; and so you won't lose scent
I'll make a stink for you to think I ink these verses full of prose
So you won't get conned out of two cent
My last will and testament: I leave my heir
My share of Roc-A-Fella Records and a shiny new beach chair

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Jay-Z]
I hear my angels sing...
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
(I hear my angels sing)
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna leave
Life is but a dream
Life is just a dream and you really don't wanna wake up, wake up

Ohh, ooh, ohh
Uh, uh, uh
It—It—It was all a dream
Last night I had a dream
Thoughts was racing through my head (It was all a dream)
Felt so real to me (It was all)
This is what was said (All-all-all-all-a-all a dream)

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
""Had a dream,"" I said; ""'Bout who?"" he said
""'Bout B.I.G.,"" I said; ""That's big,"" he said
""Dig what he said""; ""Proceed,"" he said
""Indeed,"" I said, so, breathe I did
""Don't repeat what I say,"" I said, he said nothing
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this
What I believe to be a yes, I repeated what was said
""It came to me like a whisper last evening,"" I said
""What's the deal, playboy?"" was the greeting he said
First thing I wanted to know was the reason he was dead
""Mo' Money Mo' Problems,'"" better believe it,"" he said
""Careful what you wish for, you might receive it,"" he said
""I see,"" I said, ""jealousy"" I said
""Got the whole industry mad at me,"" I said
Then B.I. said, ""Hov, remind yourself:
Nobody built like you, you designed yourself!""
""I agree,"" I said, ""my one of a kind self""
Getting stoned every day like Jesus did
""What he said,"" I said, ""has been said before""
""Just keep doin your thing,"" he said; ""say no more""
[Chorus: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Was it all a dream? Tell me
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream?
Was it all a dream?
(It was all, all-all, all, all-all, all, all-all) I gotta know
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream? (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream? A dream
Was it all a dream?

[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday, Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smoking weed and bamboo, sipping on private stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke, ""duh-ha, duh-ha""
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the (World Trade)
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowing up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
Uh, and if you don't know, now you know, nigga
[Chorus: Faith Evans & The Notorious B.I.G.]
Was it all a dream? Tell me (It was all a dream, uh)
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream? (It was all)
Was it all a dream?
(It was all, all-all, all, all-all, all, all-all, all, all-all) I gotta know
Was it all a dream? Was it a dream?
Was it all a dream? A dream (It was all a dream)
Was it all a dream?
It was all, all-all, all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all, all a dream

[Bridge: The Notorious B.I.G.]
It was all
It was all, all, all-all, all, all-all-all-all-all-all-all, all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all, all, all, all, all, a-a-a-a-a-a-a-all a dream
It was all, all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all
All-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all-all a dream

If Hov's a Blackberry Bold, then shorty is a Sidekick
She used to have a man; I used to have a side-chick
Shorty got wind; I had to blow the chick off
She got rid of him; they both took the shit hard
Shorty played the piano; me, I played with white keys
Shorty from the South—oh, I think she like me
Shorty like Pac; me, Big Poppa
She screaming, ""Hit 'em up!"" I'm screaming ""Who shot ya?""
I'm on that red wine; shorty like white
Same shit, different toilet; we both getting nice
Me, I'm from the Apple, which means I'm a Mac
She's a PC: She lives in my lap

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Whether black or white, we both like Mike
We both like Jordans, we both Phil's Knight
I finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch
Yeah we both eating, it's better than brunch
Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the coke man
Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can
Started at the window, end up at the wall
The Yin to my Yang, I skeet skeet off
In a salt and pepper 'Bach, shorty like to front
The Bonnie to my Clyde, both riding shotgun
Both covered in gold like C3P0
James and Florida Evans, let the good times roll
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Thought shorty was the truth, found out she was a cheater
We were supposed to take over, I caught her bumping ""Ether""
I thought shorty liked Mike, found out she liked Prince
Thought she was Adrian, it's been rocky ever since
My dollars was down, she left me for some Euros
Took my whole flavor, I call her Coke Zero
We were co-MVP's like Kobe and Shaq
Left me for the Heat, we were winning back to back
Said I party too much, shorty got fed up
Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up
We used to make out, kissing each other's face off
Fell for the Ponzi scheme, damn shorty just made off

[Chorus: Jay-Z & Beyoncé]
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, da-da-daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, but daddy go hard
Shorty get it in, Venus versus Mars13Embed"

Uh, just point out the bounce, uh-huh
Show me the bounce, yeah
Just point out the bounce, geah
Timbo the king, yeah
Young Hov the king, yeah
Just point out the bounce, yes
Just point out the bounce nigga
Yo, listen

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Rumor has it The Blueprint classic
Couldn't even be stopped by Bin Laden
So September 11th marks the era forever
Of a revolutionary Jay Guevara
Now it's a whole museum of Hov MC'ers
Everybody dupin' the flow—you see 'em
Everybody loopin' up soul
It's like they tryna make The Blueprint 2 before Hov
Shout out to Just Bleezy and Kanyeezy
See how we adjust to the game so easy
Chicks barely dancin, glancin every chance they get
Like, ""Oh shit, he's so handsome""
Still in demand in the longest run standing
Kidnapped rap seven years, no ransom
Can't one nigga get it back, no rap
Young Hov's going to Canton, I'ma land ya
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
(Point out the bounce) I'll show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
(Point out the bounce) I turn a eighth to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R-O-C
(Point out the bounce) Timbo the king, nigga (Uh-huh, woo)
Uh-huh, ay, uh
(Point out the bounce) Geah, young Hov the king, nigga
Uh, I got y'all

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
For those that think Hov fingers bling-blingin'
Either haven't heard the album or they don't know English
They only know what the single is
And single that out to be the meaning of what he's about
And being I'm about my business, not mingling much
Running my mouth, that shit kept lingering
But no, dummy, that's the shit I'm sprinkling
The album with to keep the registers ringing
In real life, I'm much more distinguished
I'm like a bloke from London, England
Geah, you jingling, baby
See, I go right back and I bring 'em in baby
Business mind of a Ross Perot but never lost my soul
Crossed the line, I bought pop across the row
Then I walk through the hood, where they up to no good
Slangin them O's like a real OG should
""Oh, he's good""
""No, he would never sell out, he's so hood""
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Kanye West]
(Point out the bounce) I'll show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
(Point out the bounce) I turn a eighth to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R-O-C
(Point out the bounce) Timbo the king, nigga (Uh-huh, woo)
Uh-huh, ay, uh
(Point out the bounce) Geah, young Hov the king, nigga
Uh, uh (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Magazines call me a (Rockstar) girls call me (Cock star)
Billboard (Popstar) neighborhood (Block star)
Chi-Town go-gettin' pimps (We mobsters)
Gingerbread Man even said, ""You're a monster!""
Yeah, that's how I feel (Uh-huh)
To be down, you must appeal
To the crew, we're rated R
O-C, OG, Bobby Johnson son
Ask me, ""Ray-Ray, is that yo' car?""
""I seen MTV, I know who you are""
""You did Takeover, do you got beef with Nas?""
I did take over the game, brought back the soul
Got tracks to go, got plaques that's gold
Platinum to go, yeah, that's the flow
All I know, I gots to blow
And I don't play pause, I'm from Chicago
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
I'll show you how to get this dough in
Large amounts 'til it's hard to count
(Point out the bounce) I turn a eighth to an ounce
To a whole ki to the R-O-C
(Point out the bounce) Timbo the king, nigga, uh
