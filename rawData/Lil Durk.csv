Trippin' on that drank, but I know she worth it
Independent baby, I know she workin'

I know it can be better but nobody's perfect
We flirted for a minute, DeJ, that's my baby
I ain't trippin', I'm like Henny, yeah I'm in her kidneys
She like to play her songs to the way I'm hittin' it
Turn around like, ""Damn Durk, I like the way you hittin' it""
Don't believe the rumors, girl
You know I'll do you, girl
I don't wanna hear the shit about the niggas

I let him get it when he want it, knock it down and push up on it
I was plottin' for a while, now I got him where I want him
They didn't understand none of this was planned
99 problems but a bitch better not be none
Na na, na na, yeah yeah
This ain't what he want, I told him that
Leave your girl, be through with that
Get with DeJ, he ain't ever goin' back
He was shy when I seen him, now he smile
Heard a few rumors but they ain't my style
I be hatin' when he out of town
Hotel, I FaceTime you, no towel
They ain't get it but they ain't our problem
What the fuck can they do about it?

[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)
[Verse 2: Lil Baby]
Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

[Verse 3: Polo G]
Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology
[Chorus: Lil Baby]
These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me

2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone (Broadway girls alone)
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
And you know

[Verse 1: Morgan Wallen]
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, ""You don't have to join in,"" she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Lil Durk]
Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave 'em alone)
Them Broadway girls alone (Leave 'em alone, leave ’em alone)
Leave them Broadway girls alone

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They town just told me, ""Don't trust 'em""
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars

Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home

Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage
They just tryna tell me there's

Yea, I know imma dog that shit ain't fair

See this rap shit ain't shit to me, dis ain't what they want

Fuck TMZ, fuck breaking news and ABC
I can't do no shows 'cause I terrify my city

I'm really in the field 'cause this is what I want (This what I want)
I'ma turn the streets up, this is a anthem
Niggas hate on my squad, I tell 'em step the shit up (L, Ls)
Same since day one and I can't change up
After all of the gossip, I'll still a-change some

But if I call you my brother that mean you my brother, you know what I'm sayin'?
Nothin' more, nothin' less, family
I been hearing too many rumors in these streets niggas tryin' kill us, rob us all that
What's up with that?
But it be the niggas that been around us, you know what I'm sayin'?
Or be around us
We ain't gon' slip up, we ten toes
Remy
You know what I'm sayin' we gotta make it out
That's how they gon' get it

[Chorus]
I get so high I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tried to chase a bag before I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
Get with your dog and make it right

[Verse 1]
We do pop-ups, had my back when I was locked up
I was Glocked up
Niggas hate 'cause they can't stop us (No no)
We was turnt up, gang war can't knock us
Sliding in them DMs, tryna slide up on the oppas, yeah
I'm so nauseous off them drugs, too high off them percocets
Tryna follow behind my cousin, I wasn't focused yet
We would rob the robbers, kill the killers, label us a threat
Extort your big homie, like we from LAX
I was so high, I wish I replied to L'A's text
But we had jumped into them streets and made a mess
I was dressing my homies up for they funerals
Holding on they OGs tight, they did the most
Ducking from investigation, trying to keep my reputation
Give them my expiration, looking for inspiration
Pray for my generation, fuck Trump, them bitches racist
Bought 'Raris just to race it, yeah yeah
[Chorus]
I get so high I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him
I never asked you for anything, just your honesty
How you trade on me like that? I'm your family
And she tried to chase a bag before I had to leave
But two wrongs don't make it right
Get with your dog and make it right

[Verse 2]
Joke and laugh all day to stop from crying
Keep my gun on me to stop from dyin'
Can't listen to no rumors 'cause it block my mind
Can't feed into that bullshit ain't got the time
I know what I did boy, this life I enjoy
Why you pretend boy, this shit I live for it (Uh huh)
You was hooked on drugs, I was hooked on phonics
Signed to the street,s I ain't never go to college
Asked you for cash, you ain't never say you got it (Damn)
But I gave you my last, yeah
And I'm the same nigga since last year
I told my momma I can't go down for this case
Got the same lawyer, beat R. Kelly piss case
State's attorney want me so bad
At the time I need you bad
Told myself ain't going back
Told myself can't go like that
[Chorus]
I get so high I put these drugs into my system
I love you with all my heart, ain't no probably
You choose your life over your son, that shit killed him

Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?

But she should go gold
Ain't really been in love in a minute
It won't hurt if no one know 'bout me
Fuck a bag off

It was a joke when he copped out, now he wanna jump the wall

Gotta watch them cheesy, sneaky bitches, they be stealin' nut
I talk down on the trenches' hoes, knowin' damn well I still fucked
But the money keep me insane, and I ain't know what a homie was
I was fucked up in the trenches, I ain't even know what a Rollie was
I used to look up to this nigga, but he gave his homie up
'Cause his daughter twelve years old, he gotta go do twenty-one
And I don't fuck with no fuck niggas, so these niggas don't owe me nothin'
Grown niggas act like kids, actin' like they Benjamin Button
Put my own fee down for my lawyer, that shit was twenty-one hundred
Had a deep talk with my dawg and he still wasn't comin'
With a gun or without his gun, I say he still not runnin'
And he tote his gun like 50, but he still one hundred, nigga

He took a Percocet, wasn't all tryna pop a pill
Tryna prove a point to pop off first, he ain't your dawg for real
I gotta acknowledge that Lam' truck 'cause I had a Bonneville
I don't get mad when the guys tell me no 'cause I know my mama will
Different niggas, they rockin' Polo, I'm rockin' Tommy Hil'
Trenches niggas, they'll drop it all when it's time to kill
First time was a throw off on my backgrounds when I signed a deal
They say it's favoritism, nah, these the ones I love the most
I bought her two, three diamond chokers 'cause she love to choke
1942 with a small pill, she love the boat
Durkio, Smurkio, yeah, she love the G.O.A.T.
Yeah, I love them G locks
Got away from all them phony niggas, I had to detox

[Verse 2: Pooh Shiesty]
I'm King Draco, got my name off drillin', check the record, bitch (Slatt, slatt, slatt, slatt)

Send off a bag 'bout my lil' cousin, they fakin', they'll call it quit (Woah, woah)
They make me mad enough, I spin through there myself, say the wrong shit (Say the wrong shit)
Might still sip when I get low (Woah), but I prefer Wock' over Tris (Wocky over Tris)
Fucked up and let me in the door (Woah), I went fully on all the sticks (Sticks)
I'm Mr.-Slime-'Em-Out (Blrrrd), I caught his back door, unlocked on a lick (Blrrrd)
Or Mr.-Leave-No-Evidence (Blrrrd), know my criminal book hella thick (On God)
You niggas goose, ain't got no gun, you went away, your ass a dummy
I'm on my sixth Moncler this winter, I couldn't wait to get some money
My lil' nigga up four souls, he caught two dressed up like a junkie
They thought I was just rappin' (Blrrrd), lay that murder gang, that shit ain't funny (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
You lay, the murder gang, they come through, that shit ain't funny (Uh, blrrrd)
I'm locked in with hunters, from the God, got killers 'round the country (Uh, blrrrd, blrrrd)
I might don't need to slime 'em out, just be yourself and stay three hunnid (Hunnid)
We get money Monday through Saturday, pray to Trey Day every Sunday (Trey Day every)
My clique tied up in the field (Blrrrd), won't never hear me go out runnin' (Nope)
Post up a pic like I'm in L.A., but the whole time I'm with gun (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Ain't tryna keep hearin' 'bout that shit you did, go get active again (The whole time)
It's either eat or get ate on my side, I'ma fuck the drops and go and spin (Spin)
Three and O, we skunkin' shit, get one more kill, conceal the win (Win)
Beef with us, won't never land 'til y'all get hit up with them pens (Pens)
Can't come around unless you get a body, chopper, F&N (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
We caught one of them pussies drunk, he died before he dropped the Henn' (Blrrrd, blrrrd)
Got 'bout ten whips in my garage and still don't know what to get in (Take off)

[Verse 1]
This is how I feel, I got your love attached to me
And you know I truly love you, it was never about no pussy
And you told me that them niggas ain't for me, they just want my money
And I like the way you is, you ain't tryna kick it with my buddies
And I got a habit and I like that you don't judge me
And that's so fucked up that I'm glad to be a junkie
To fall in love, I say I been afraid
I'm mixin' lean with Lyrical Lemonade
And we on top, ain't no more public aid
Or callin' your boss to get another raise
I drop some Backwood ashes in the Wraith
Reminiscing 'bout the older days

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the people don't let the 'net ruin they relationship
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the females who won't listen to another bitch
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the niggas in the trenches turned to gentlemen
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta tell the truth, this the best relationship I ever been in
[Verse 2]
Whoever thought that I can make this shit?
Voice of the streets and relationship
And we don't care what the rumor is
Fuck these other hoes 'cause I love my bitch
Alexander McQueen and Rockstar jeans
The prosecutor hatin' 'cause I'm doin' my thing
Six kids plus her daughter, that's what it is (Oh, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na)
I seen Rel fall in love, I know that shit crazy
I seen Booka fall in love, I know that shit crazy
Inside, and don't let the outside run that situation
And it's me and her forever, it's a lit-uation, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I gotta raise the roof for the people don't let the 'net ruin they relationship

[Verse 1]
Them niggas act like they don't need us
They do everything we doing they wanna be us
Foenem takin' ecstasy, they tryna T up
He rather go and blow a bag instead of re-up
You wasn’t on that block when that shit was goin' on
I wasn't worried about the other side when that shit was goin' on
And we don't hang with different niggas, don't ask us what we on
The only time we'll beat the case, you pull out camera phones
I used to draw Lil' Mo name on the styrofoam
I had to teach the grown niggas, right from wrong
Why the state had told the jury, ""They tryna indict us all""
The lawyers got them affidavits, they better sign them all, hm
I had a bad bitch off the 'Gram, she let her titties hang
She told Bandz I bought her a Birkin, I told her anything
I was ridin' 'round with guns in that Bentley thang
We puttin' stickers on our drums, that's a city thang
I hate the niggas who be tryna switch the block up
I be with the killers who would change a nigga roster
I'm from the part of the city, watch your partner
You ain't did shit to the same nigga who shot ya
'Fore you leave that door, gotta pick your Glock up
Can't nut in no more whores, I got that from my momma
Shuttin' down the stores, you do that with these commas
You had me at my lowest, I'm ridin' 'round with choppers
[Chorus]
(Oh)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked out by my homie (No, no, no, no, no, yeah, yeah)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know that shit's phony (No, no, no, no, no, whoa)
Close that backdoor, can't get snaked by my homie (Oh)
Close that backdoor 'cause I know this love phony

[Verse 2]
That's a bet
I'm The Voice, that mean Dee-Dee, he the threat
Don't get stretched, 'cause foenem tweakin' off the X
I know what happened to your homie, don't be next
He got that get back for his block, I tilt my hat
I feel like I'm drownin', got this water 'round my neck
Cocky nigga throwin' ashes on Pateks
Went to the trench store, threw up the treys on the mat (Yeah)
They be callin' me, you hangin' with dangerous
I'm just slidin' 'til out west, just for Uncle Remus
All my sibling's kids know your uncle famous
I know this shit sound dumb and the strangest
In the trenches, I feel the safest
On the radio, shoutout Nehpets
Did it off the love but I gave ‘em faces

Shit be so different, I'm watchin' them niggas who bitches but yellin' out, ""Bang, bang"" (Bang, bang)
Roll up a blunt of that Pluto
Used to be deep, now I'm riding 'round uno
I know some niggas who hustlin' but quit
'Cause they was doin' this shit for too long
I remember niggas feelin' like brothers
But now this shit feel like a group home
And I had told 'em I love 'em so much
To me, it felt like you can't do wrong
I was trappin' out the side of my granny crib
I was servin' with two phones
I remember tellin' jewelers, ""Don't know what a Patek is""
Now it's two-tone

The money make the world spin
The money make the girls grin
Been rapping since 2010
Whoever thought I'd win?

Asked them why they sellin' food stamps
I done grabbed a Urus on some cool shit
I'ma get it on my own, when I felt alone
I remember feelin' useless
I remember servin' to the cool kids
Twin got a .30 like a pool stick
Why you think your murders turn to news clips?
When a nigga die, when his family cry
And they'll swear to God that he ain't do shit
I remember niggas being goofy
Spending their last money on the Gucci
He just got fly just to get him some coochie
Went to jail ridin' 'round with a goofy
I can actually say I'm feelin' like money
I remember riding 'round with a hunnid
Had twin with me ridin' one hunnids
Gucci bagged up with fifty one-hunnids
Super motivated, come from a dungeon
Like, why you call the dungeon the trenches?
It don't matter 'cause I'm bringin' my niggas
Why you fall out with me just for attention?
Niggas die when they pop up in my mentions
Had the realest nigga tell you're a peasant
Took a Perc' and it got me in my feelings (Got me in my feelings)

Man, I've been trappin' since 2007

From juvenile to penitentiary, I'm better
I'm happy I can say I got it together
Fifty-three percent of these niggas feminine
I am not a gangsta, I am a gentleman
We the ones that handle murders like businessmen
Postin' money on the 'Gram, I invented that
I done came a long way from the middleman
I got head for an hour in the Cullinan
I done gave a thousand bows to my brother 'nem
Shit get serious when them bodies start comin' up
I put a kit on the Urus, it's bigger now
Told my baby mama, ""We need a bigger house""
I'm too real for this shit, I done figured out
Got one foot in the streets, tryna pull it out
Keep it lowkey, she ain't runnin' her mouth (Mouth)
She don't ever want me to pull out (Out)
I ran it up to a low from an ounce
I'm rockin' clothes I can't even pronounce
Fuck the pandemic, I love me a drought

We ain't talk in a minute, so don't hit me up
And I mix my feelings with prescription drugs
When I fell to my knees, you ain't pick me up
When I was down on my back, you said I ain't rich enough
And we ain't talk about no sex 'cause you ain't get it up
And I don't want you to suck my dick 'cause you ain't spit enough
You an ungrateful lil' bitch, said I ain't spend enough
You told me you want your ass shots 'cause you ain't thick enough
I'm in the trenches with the sharks, I ain't have a heart
Some nights I ain't wanna talk, I left you in the dark
You was lurkin' on my page, you became a narc'
You was writing bitches back, that shit went too far
And I carried you on my back like I ain't have a car
You was kinda mad I hang with murderers

You steady throwin' your pussy, but I don't want none
I got a wife, so after me you gotta fuck Von
Then Ikey, then Booka, then it's more fun
I kick her out slick as hell, tell her, ""Store run""
I know a couple divas, that's still a secret
The bitches I made eat it, you would not believe it
This shit was never easy, I move strategic
Me and two, three singers, we had a threesome
Back to back, fuckin' back to back, off the perky
Back to back, told her all them lies, I was perfect
Always tryna run the streets deep, I was thirsty
Gotta watch my back, a lot of niggas tryna hurt me
That's why I keep my .50 and my .30
Niggas ain't on shit, they washed up, detergent
Big Backwood, sat back and burned it
I'm better, hot like a furnace, yeah

I'ma get your Patek bust, I'ma let you count it up (Yeah yeah)
Bust down Patek for me (Turn up)
Put my dick on her teeth (Turn up)
Fucked up and gave her the key (Skrrt)
I gave her the recipe (Turn up)
I got my head in the streets (Got my head in the streets)
She like when I suck on her feet (She like when I suck on her feet)
She in love with me
She like it doggy style (She like it doggy style)
She count up a hundred thou' (She count up a hundred thou')
Cheat on me, it can't be long
Pass me the drugs, my high comin' down
[Chorus]
It's gon' be okay, okay, okay
Just don't leave, okay, okay, okay
Baby lead the way, the way
Yeah, yeah, the way, the way
I'm talkin' 'bout today, right now, I need you (Oh oh)
When you caught me cheatin', I caught amnesia (Oh oh)
And I'm Durkio, it's nice to meet you (Oh oh)
And she sexy, she got her features (Mmh mmh mmh)
When I see you down, I pick up the pieces (Pick up the pieces)
I was feeling like a clown, I thought you would leave me

[Verse 2]
And I can't let nobody tell me that my bitch goin'
And we got strong mind, I told her we gon' get through it, oh oh
In her Rick Owens, I had to put my rent on it
And I was broke as hell, she thought I had some shit goin'
No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine, and no
And I'm so cocky, got a big ego
Her head so sloppy, got to take off these drawers
You ain't gotta worry 'bout me vanishing
And I'm down for the cause and the challenges
I fell out with my dawg 'bout money, it was not 'bout a bitch
But he told her I had a girl, but he told her right before I hit
She say I run my mouth 'cause I told my guys I hit
But he was with me when I seen you, I said I gotta hit
And I knew he was kinda hatin', he said I got a bitch
They DM'ed her from a fake page but it was too accurate
It was him
Edible arrangement, bring flowers
Couldn't say I cheated 'cause I was a bachelor
That pussy pancakes, my tongue a spatula
And I take Adderall so I can add it up
My first gun was a Smith & Wesson
These ain't no SI's, these VVS's
I was in them trenches, yeah I need a blessing
Couldn't get into good school, I was getting rejected
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time, and no
No make-up, no inches, no lipo
And I know that you know I'm psycho
Love her perfume, bring me more shrooms
My heart got no room, I don't need no tomb
No I won't hurt you, 'cause we global
The world know you, the world know you
[Chorus]
It's gon' be okay, okay, okay
Just don't leave, okay, okay, okay
Baby lead the way, the way
Yeah, yeah, the way, the way
I'm talkin' 'bout today, right now, I need you (Oh oh)

How you 'round me always broke, don't wanna do nothin'?
And I watched you sell your pole for like two hundred
And that's a cluck move
Plenty nights it was me and you, I was screaming fuck you

[Verse 1]
And I grew up 'round them youngins, I said fuck school
Only me and you was trappin', we had much room
And I was zoned off them perkies, you off mushrooms
And I told 'em if they touch you they in trouble
Ain't no city like Chicago 'cause we home of them gangsters
Rob everything that move, we was pullin' them capers
I'm talking dice games
When bro 'nem opened up the trap, I seen them hypes came
My two hoes stay with some strap, it's a dyke thing
Got a hundred on my neck
Hundred on my wrist, Audemar, no Patek
Came from the bottom, yeah I felt the neglect

Can't ride around regular, car tinted up
The way this fifty blowin' you would think it was ten of us
I talked to Lauren and jail call in the Bentley truck
Heard that rumor I got shot and I got hemmed up
Even though I'm ten toes, won't give near' fucks
Hoodie on, skully on, mob Corleone
And they couldn't find a witness, Von gon' be home
He ain't wanna keep attendance 'cause his days was long
Came from nothing, who'd of thought what we'd get paid for shows?

We been fucking for a year, before they know'd about it
Boy, you know that pussy good, but don't go boast about it
Boy, you know that pussy wet when you swim deep inside it
I suggest you wear a vest if you plan on surviving
Ya day was long, the sex was good
So tell me all about it
If you too tired, be my bike, relax and let me ride it

I was goin' through that pain alone
I was goin' through that phase alone
We all change, you say I change alone
Sleepless nights, barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong
I was tired, they didn't realize
Certain vibes, it don't feel right
Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy, know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio, but I'm Chicago JAY-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe today, was lookin' crazy
Money ran low, right? Felons can't vote, right?
I can't even vote for who I believe in, shit ain't goin' right
I didn't drop a tear inside the funeral, I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site

Quarantine what? I'm just tryna make a buck
Talkin' to my dawg, he be actin' like he stuck
Favorite gun a Glock, it slipped up, what a month
Throw it in they face every time I hold it up
Granny ain't feelin' too well
Shootout with the police, I ain't goin' to jail
How you actin' off a case, you'll know if you tell
I know a nigga from the hood, he'll serve with no scale
Watchin' Bands make a play, I seen him score in the mail
Gave him thirty-nine years, I heard him cry in the cell
Even though I'm gettin' big, I bought a MAC through my Zelle
Took a picture on my block, they think I'm back in the field

And I can't turn my back on Boona like I ain't see him tryin'
These tears shed, whenever he dead, it's different seein' him die
Bah, get close up on 'em, you know that shit be graphic
You gotta pop out with that ratchet, you know this shit get tragic
And you can't fumble with that stick, you know this shit ain't Madden
All that shit you did in the streets, you know that shit gon' vanish
Yeah, I pop these pills, they try to read my thoughts
And you can't dig back in your past 'cause you got time you lost
And make that time up for your kids 'cause you know time ain't bought
Booka bought me a diamond cross, but he know he won't cross me
They turned they back and said they'd kill me, yeah, that's when they lost me
I put baguettie inside the Cartier 'cause I'm feelin' bossy
They feel some type of way in the county jail, I told 'em call me
I built a relationship with the real with niggas who never saw me
Yeah, I seen my chance and that's when I grabbed it
Fuck bein' a hundred, I spent a couple hundred on niggas' tablets
Lean gave me chest pain, that's when I popped the Perky tablet
I tried to get that family vibe for niggas who wasn't established
You do that shit again, what you did to bro gon' get you a casket

And I don't talk to a lotta niggas, but they still the bros
The ones I ain't talk to like that back then, know they still hoes
And some niggas try to hide they hate, but that shit still show
I never fucked on block hoes because I call 'em sisters
One hate me right now as I speak because I called her a hooker
Cut the loose ends, I cut 'em off, they try to say I'm a butcher
Bitch, you a rat, never mind, I changed my life, I'm Muslim
I talked to Chops on FaceTime, he say, ""Damn, you back smokin'""
He say, ""That back door damn near closed,"" I say, ""It's back open""
I say, ""These blocks could be back one,"" he say, ""You back hopin'""
You gotta watch them niggas you love 'cause they still backdoorin'
He ain't got no hope in beatin' his trial because he lost his motion
Bro got life, he don't know how pussy smell, that's why he fuck his lotion
I know some real niggas would lose it all for a viral moment
My dreads swing, I feel like Wayne, show me my opponent

[Outro]
You know, I like talkin' to the streets, like
When you say you the voice, you gotta, like, open up, like
Tell motherfuckers, like, what it is, like, you can't hold nothin' back
You gotta relate to them, relate to the poverty, you know what I'm sayin'?
Relate to the trenches
You know what I'm sayin', I can't be talkin' 'bout a Richard Mille all the time, know what I'm sayin'?
Some of the guys don't even know what the fuck a Richard Mille is

Man, my city was goin' crazy, rest in peace to Chino (Chino)

That street shit
We don't reply to niggas with that tweet shit (Facts)
Beef shit, nigga said fuck me, he ain't mean it (Pussy)
Sweet shit, foenem caught a body, they gon' beat it
Defense, Glock to his face, he won't eat it (Brr)
All facts, nigga snaked me once and I'ma fall back (Let's get it)
Nigga say he my brother, but he snaked me, what you call that?
I cheated on my BM three times with my dog ass
She gave her number, I delete it, 'cause they all rats
Chiraq, where the police don't call backup
Last nigga played with Durkio, he in a backwood
Chicago niggas play with PnB, but ain't no matchup
If you know me like you know me, where I'm from, I'm not a rapper
Burglar, scammer, a murderer, I'm handsome
When I'm off the drugs, I swear I'm steady throwin' tantrums
Angelo told me once before, he want a Phantom
I can't say no 'cause that's my son, I gotta answer

They say we won't get help unless Obama do it (Turn up)
Don't get shot in my areas, ain't no trauma unit (Let's get it)
If you a snake and they ain't do, just know the opps'll do it (Know the opps'll do it)
And go and drill, this the best time 'cause the opps into it (Brr)
I still sleep around the savages like I ain't rich
You talkin' to me about your homie, that's that fake shit (Turn up)
The city ain't never played my songs, shoutout to Nehpets
Just take that watch up of your arm 'fore we take it (Yeah, yeah)
And we the reason for your dead niggas
Breadwinners, when you hit that stain you ain't share with us
Fuck the Instagram, this reality
I know a nigga talk straight cash, and he ain't got a G
They had my momma usin' WIC when we in poverty
And I was tired of eatin' Kix, but she know I gotta eat
Stop lyin', stop tellin' niggas you gon' ride for me
Stop lyin', stop tellin' niggas you gon' die for me

You turn me on when you be shavin' off your pussy
Makin' that macaroni sound when it gushy
She gon' give me the sloppiest head with her good teeth
And she love when I be off them Percocets when I'm munchin'
Snatch the condom off, goin' raw sex with it 'cause it feel better
Put my finger in her, when I take it out then we just gon' lick it together
Audacity to ask you when I'm done with bitches, like when we gon' get it together?
Why don't thesе niggas be lovin' these bitchеs? Me and Runny hit 'em together
I'ma go buy the lil' bitches Celine bags, she ain't seen cash
When we sat down, she told me that it's more cash then it's more ass
She told me her ex-nigga ain't had no cash, he worked for DoorDash
He ain't even cash out on her birthday, he gave her store credit

It's your boy Lil Durk man
King of Chicago man
This is not a diss

[Verse 1]
Caught a new case and shit, made me look basic
Police want names, cause I done made it
Don't fuck with my niggas, they left a nigga hanging
Free Zoo and free DD, hardbodies don't say shit
Don't be from Mubu, this rap shit is fufu
(We don't rap beef, nigga!)
Catch me on Normal, with Twin he a loose screw
(My niggas go nuts!)
These niggas is snitching, we callin' em blues clues
They telling the police, giving em loose clues
I fuck with the Migos, but I am not Capo
Sipping on purple, I'm feeling like harpo
(I'm sippin' on act!)
These niggas want war, knock meat out his taco
For that beef with our team , we shooting like porno
Shots out of Chiraq, born central city
Now I'm in LA, eating shrimp with Diddy
My daddy got booked with some books and a couple of millis
The next deal I sign is gonna be for a couple of millis
I don't rock Gucci, I just like Louis V
That swipe shit is cool, but you will not Woochie me
How you gone wife her, she just gon' do the team
You stick to the smokes and the molly, I'mma do the lean
Shout out to B.O.N., I'm talking 'bout Bump and 'nem
You diss on Chiraq, you is not coming here
(Better ask them niggas)
You so GDK, now you a thug again?
You so BDK, now you a thug again?
With these birds man I feel rich homie like Thugger 'nem
(Like Rich Gang)
How you feel today, and thinking we plugging him
And I lost a couple niggas that I can't hug again
But I seen a couple niggas I cannot mug again
Shout out to Def Jam, No I.D. 'nem
Homicide on the scene, no I.D. him
(Took off his face with this 40!)
Sipping on lean, my IV Kit
They look at IG, they wanna be him
I call up D Thang, he dress a nigga up
Call up Randy Boy, po' lean in my cup
I call up Ikey Mikey, he shooting shit up
They talkin' bout Durk, he picking shit up
Fuck all that eating shit, I'm with this beef shit
I use a lot of autotune, but I'm with this street shit
(Ask all the opps!)
I bang like Chop, but I'm on my Keef shit
(I'm fuckin' with him right now!)
Take a nigga down, but we will not keep shit
Shout out to 4-6, shout out to Dog Pound
Shout out to 300, they will not make a sound
Niggas be tweaking, I know they 'gone hate us now
If Kobe leave league, there ain't no Lakers now
Take me out of Chiraq, like Jordan off the Bulls
How you the king of Chiraq you ain't got no pull
And these niggas throwing L's like these niggas loyal (These niggas ain't loyal at all!)

What you don't know won't hurt you
You told police I hurt you
Like fuck that bitch who birthed you
Y'all had me at my lowest
I love my brothers who snaked me but I don't wanna show it
Can't fuck with you, I'm honest
Locked in that cell, my first son, I ain't get to see him potty
I'm off them drugs when I get mad, I say I'm goin' Scottie
Take off them Guccis in the trenches, I wear Foamposites
Lawyer fees and bond money, I drop big deposits
I drop big deposits, I like my ho exotic
My gun get molestic, they bound to catch a body
My homie got bodied, I keep they mamas happy
My kids, they goin' to college, I sold dope at Giuseppe's (Chopsquad)

They ain't love you like I love you
You told me you ain't trust 'em
And you only believe in me, told you they say fuck you
Look what they did to the muscle, best believe these niggas gon' touch you
Give the pussy up for free, shawty know I'ma tussle
You my brother for life
Man, that shit don't sit right with me
Niggas say they gon' ride with me
When you died, I was on your side
Mama, I need you
Your son, he needs you
Your son is evil, they think they equal
These niggas don't get it
Gotta ride around in my city

Thirty Percs got me dizzy
Got my gun, got one on top
Keep niggas in my business, ain't no rules to the trenches

Before you say I left you hangin', get a bond, oh

And I got caught with four, five hoes, I'm so embarrassed
I put the streets before myself, it gave me leverage
No  disloyal in my heart, whatever that is
Came  a long way from Amiris, rocking Ballys
I know some niggas don't take care of they kids, they don't call 'em daddy

Give you Chanel sneaks, then a Chanel bag color cherry
And I ain't nothing like them other niggas, so don't compare me

Fuck my past, you can't hold onto nothing
When you mad, you say go'n on and fuck

Pour a cup of that dirty

Gotta watch out in these streets

Can't trust none of these niggas
Don't love none of these bitches
How they judging me nigga
I came up from these trenches
I might roll a blunt up for my people

Baby momma actin' evil
Uncle still playin' wit them needles
New car gas diesel
New money cash Visa
Nuski died what they believin'
Brotha muslim to my pops too
Tell 'em pigs no pork needed
We ain't tryna talk no agreements
Beat my case wit the best lawyer
Told my sister I want the best for ya
Fuck a strippa go invest money
IG hoes that's a test for ya
Devil workin' want the best of ya
Street niggas make a mess of ya
Lil niggas put stress on ya
Yea yea yea
Start them killas off of guns, start the traphouse off of pounds
Bitch you know I love my son, boy my back was on the ground
Who love you when no one there, who love you when no one care

The way you snatched my heart, feel like you had it before
The way I kiss your lips, feel like I kissed you before
Fuck you from the back, feel like I hit it before
And I asked you for some anus, like you ain’t did it before
Before me, I don't care who was before me
You lonely, now you ain't gotta be lonely
My baby, challenges, you know ’em, baby
I gravitated your love for the making
Baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, our marriage
Makе sure you make a hundred Ms off cosmеtics
When I decide to get you a ring, I'm gettin' all carats
And they sneak diss from fake pages, they all jealous
And when I do tell you I love you, it don't be small letters
And you gon' cuss a nigga out, tryna fuck for some Margielas
I hate when you try to ignore me, they tried to say that you ain't for me
I had to figure it out on my own, had to take you on this journey
Got my heart screamin', uh-uh-mm, mm-mm
Stop movin' girl, I’m bout to cum
I changed your life from the ghetto
You got me screamin’ falsetto
Put you in that rose gold, take off that metal
Love when your landing, see you at arrival
""No Label"" song wasn't for you, I need a title
Done fuckin’ these hoes everywhere, I need a bridal
She don't care to be around my boys
You concealed and carried my heart like a FOID
I don't want no different hoes like Floyd
Give you my last name, that's Banks, like Lloyd
I’m holding you down, you so used to clowns
Pop up unannounced, told me he a mouse
Told me don't give him pounds, told me he ain't allowed
Told me he ain't my crowd, it was true, so I'm proud

All these niggas say that they gang, they ain't even did shit for the guys
Same way that Pluto died, we gon' do the same shit to the Y
Gotta eat, bitch I trust went in my pants, took some cash
How you know a nigga from your hood told and you ain't tryna put him on blast?
Man, Terry died in his sleep off fake Percs, not no meds
They come around 'bout bodies, gotta go blame niggas who dead (Shh)
That same day my cousin died, I couldn't tame it with meds
They ask me where I'ma be in ten years, shit, I said, ""The feds""
They ask me what I'ma do about ****, shit, he dead

Drugs straight out the capsule, send her ass to molly world
I don't even drink for real, but I damn near fucked a bottle girl
I just bought a bitch two pair of Chanels, I told her, ""Model for it""
When I'm in the club with niggas I don't like, we havin' bottle wars
Said to my man like we on that nigga ass, ain't no talkin' to us
Give me compliments, my bitch for real, but ain't no talkin' to her
Champagne back to back in the Gucci store when I walk through it
Get high, then I treat the mic like therapy 'cause I talk to it
I sit back and ask myself, ""Why?"" so many times
They treatin' sports just like the streets, they tryna give 'em fines
He in the trenches without a gun, I called and gave him mine
Bumped heads with my day ones yesterday, I say I'ma give 'em time
Hope BA get right back off that time, they gave him fifty-five
I hate Tayski gone forever, we locked in on 59th
He was my dawg, he was my 'round, he was like fifty twice
I made it out, I beat the odds, you gotta be precise
Me and my auntie had some words, that shit ate me alive
See, my lil' daughter bad as hell and she ain't even five
He got the same time as the shooter and he ain't even drive
An O-P-P got hit in his T-O-P and he ain't even die
I've seen so many young niggas lose they lives
That's why when I go to a funeral today, I don't even cry
And that real shit run in my veins
Some niggas I don't fuck with for real, they just wanted my stain
I put ninety on your head, that's one of my chains
And I can't cap, that nigga Von made me go to Johnny Dang
I popped a pill and hit my head, damn, I was feelin' strange
I'm swingin' first whenever a nigga ask me what I bang
When you lose five niggas in one summer, that's when you'll feel my pain
You ain't gotta snatch it, they'll kill you, you can't feel my chains
I'm the highest in the room, I feel just like La Flame
They'll give you life, but change to a dub if you give 'em names
Yeah, my life for real for real, this not a movie
If a nigga I know support my song, they'll call 'em groupies
And they ain't even meet Lil Baby, but they'll go post his music
And that's my dawg for sure, yeah, that's my dawg for sure
And I be stressed out with my kids, sometimes I don't call at all
And you be actin' like you off Percs, but you off Tylenol
I done popped some X and I told my mama I was off Adderall

And I was walkin' around my block, my Glock is stallin' deans, yeah

I got my shooters they shooting, we show them niggas no mercy
From the pot to the block, from the block to the lot
I got to duck from the ops, they be too cool with the cops
See my life like a movie, I caught a case for the tooly
The judge given out ten I ain't scared I do it
So if a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
If a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
Son needed his daddy I still need him right now
He doing life in the Feds need that appeal right now
I catch a body I'm gone, I'm dipping right out of town
I see the scout who told he getting pelled right down
L's up to I die, blood, sweat, and some tears
Def Jam they signed me, complete my dream as a kid
Got locked up told my celly, he thinking life is a gig
Tell'em all I'm on TV MTV I'm the shit
I hit a stain on some bricks, I can't look back I'm ahead
I can't look back on this bread, I guess disease is to rare
One did and it spread where I be 64th
All that rating is dead I put a nine to his head
Lil rock snatched for attempt lawyer money I got him
If he can't hold weight he best believe I'm gonna spot'em
I can't sit in the streets and let my real niggas rotting
All black like I'm Bruce, so who think that was robbing
And they drop my advanced, I'ma cop me up six
I'ma carry a fenz and I'ma cop me a Benz
I got Tommy's and Mac's, 40 cals, Glock 10's
Momma told me you gon make it but, you can't get it in
I'm a trapper to rapper, real niggas to actors
Same people who’s fans they use to say ain't a factor
I'm on top of the city, so them rumors ain't matter
8 balls the size of baseballs in the field I'ma batter
A nigga tried to kill me dead, ops tried to wheel me in
Like the Cubs in '79 them niggas won't win again
Judge told me eye to eye PD riding on her end
Get caught with another slammer they say they first offer 10
I can't change up like a penny, I want head just like a penny
You won’t catch in the telly, catch me in back of the Bentley
Niggas know I'm nailing shit, niggas know we killing shit
I don't really give a fuck all my niggas we be in it
We be 30 deep at least 30 of us polled up
Taking risk that I hope and see my baby growing up
Russian roulette in the streets, life is all about luck
Pussy, money, weed, loyalty, trust is what a nigga lust
I'ma I'm packing like a Green Bay Packer, all white Challenger, saltine cracker
Free all of my niggas doing more than 3 calenders
Pigs snatched me up, smacked me up cause I ain't answer them
Can't snitch ain't a bone in my body say bitch
I can't switch, half them shooters ain't shooting they faking

Came a long way to a mansion crib
I had roaches at my granny crib
Jumped into the streets on accident
Police snatched me up they better not ask me shit
I don't want no Quali I want some Actavis
I bet that nigga won't lack again
Remember I had them 2s for 10s
Put me on child support you better not ask for shit
On my dead body
I remember wakin' up and seeing a dead body
And I can't go back on my word that's on my dead body
Don't come to my funeral crying ova my dead body
And I ain't gon' pick you out I'm talking 'bout everybody
I remember selling weed inside some Ed Hardy's
My homie he the police he might be fed probably
That's on my dead body

[Verse 1]
You ain't never been in a shootout with yo' homie he ain't shoot back
Niggas don't try me when I'm by myself 'cause I'm too strapped
Always tryin' to fix some shit where its loose at
Couldn't get none to eat where I'm at I sold loose squares
Tryin' tell my judge my story like who cares
Can't explain the love I got in for Dahmir (for my son)
Don't come outside when it's war I think you scared
Wasn't in my life I tell my kids you dead
Know some niggas that'll snake their homies for some meds
Know some niggas that don't take care of their homies in the feds
Know some niggas that took some gunshots to the head
No reaction and scream ""gang gang"" when I'm dead
Please be greater, don't please these haters
When that Bentley paddle, like please these gators
I don't cry at wakings, I'ma grieve later
You don't believe me now, you gon' believe me later
You ain't bleeding now, you gon' bleed later
We don't buy 5s 7s, nigga we take 'em

Ain't let money change him

Kept guns from being bullied
Cap guns to keep 'em fully

Police snatched me up they better not ask me shit
I don't want no Quali I want some Actavis
I bet that nigga won't lack again
Remember I had them 2s for 10s
Put me on child support you better not ask for shit
On my dead body
I remember wakin' up and seeing a dead body
And I can't go back on my word that's on my dead body
Don't come to my funeral crying ova my dead body
And I ain't gon' pick you out I'm talking 'bout everybody
I remember selling weed inside some Ed Hardy's
My homie he the police he might be fed probably
That's on my dead body4Embed"

(Ayy, pull up, Lamb)

[Verse 1]
They ain't doing they job, they ain't serve and protectin'
Even street niggas need that love and affection
Big homies not big homies, they ain't tryna give direction
The advice they gave to me, I told them niggas they could've kept it
Could've stayed on the porch, but jumped inside the streets, I had a selection
Ain't no back and forth talkin' on the 'net, we send a message
You want the king, you want that tiger head like the nigga off of Tekken
Put blood, sweat, and tears inside of this shit, you gotta respect it
You ain't did shit for the streets, so how you gon' put a word in?
I'ma do what all I can do, but I ain't never say I was perfect
Man, that gun heavy, palms sweaty, you acting nervous
Put a hundred thousand on his head, that's two verses
The county days, I used to wake up, wash up with the Jergens
She told me three niggas she fucked, when I went in, she was a virgin
And I can't hang around no bitch niggas, I'm too allergic
An iPhone plus an iPhone, two jail calls, I merge it

[Chorus]
The one I called my brother not my brother 'cause he told them other niggas we not brothers
I can't tell a nigga that I meant that I love him, I be lying, I don't love him
Get in my feelings when I pop all prescriptions, I take all these pills and I crush 'em
If you ain't known for having cash or that bag, they gon' treat you like you nothing
[Verse 2]
Don't be telling me 'bout your block, nigga, fuck them
You can't bring your ass around if you say fuck twin
Into it with us, kiss your kids, make sure they tucked in
Two fifties in a millennium clip, that's a buck-ten
The one you look up to a pussy, his nuts tucked in
Ain't hide the guns fast enough, the police rushed in
And since you died for your gang, you got slumped in
You pull up bleeding out that pussy, you got a sucker then
You signed your name up on that statement, you got the best font
You asked me do I love you? Mhm, I'm nonchalant
Went on the 'Gram, seen an opp died, that's when I sparked a blunt
Maybe sipped a lil' lean too, but that's not the point
A lot of money through Western Union get you a blocked account
I'm on camera, I got a case, so foenem knock 'em out
We move the same, we all as one, that's what I'm talking 'bout
I'm the same, you touch my chain, foenem chalk 'em out, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
The one I called my brother not my brother 'cause he told them other niggas we not brothers
I can't tell a nigga that I meant that I love him, I be lying, I don't love him
Get in my feelings when I pop all prescriptions, I take all these pills and I crush 'em

Sheroid was a cool nigga
A real nigga, not a stoop pigeon
I hate J Money move loose with it
He the one that's out the roof with it
You think you tough, you got your clip extended
Been on my own, I'm feelin' independent
I love you too, but I don't know your feelings
You ain't gotta tell me 'cause I know the difference
I wash my pain away with painkillers
No new friends, I'm with the same niggas
Came from nothin', you see what fame get us?
They went to jail, took care of the main niggas
Baby mama realer than some day ones
I gotta stash the drugs whenever they come
I made ""Dis Ain't What U Want"" inside the basement
Stayed alive inside the trenches, yeah, I made it
What's-his-name would've been around, but he hated
I fell off with my sound and they faded
Look at me now, I'm shittin' in they faces
Them billions close around, I can taste it
Bitches stealin' kids, they tryna take 'em out my testicles
I was fuckin' strippers, I was actin' unprofessional
Lookin' at my son and I tell him, ""I'ma better you""
And that shit we doin', we get caught, we goin' federal
I won't say it no more, you get Dior, you actin' sexual
All the opps unhealthy, but I know a couple vegetable
Leave me alone, I don't wanna talk no more
And I found myself, I ain't feelin' lost no more
Good weed with the Coldarin don't make me cough no more
The reason niggas dyin', it ain't my fault no more
He don't love his block, he not a boss no more
He died off the pill, I don't wanna pop no more

I went to jail and met Muslims, reason I don't eat swine
Ain't talked to my son in a minute, my mama had told me fine
My cousin had went to the feds and told me that he took his time
I lost my mind, I thought I was trippin', they told me that he dropped a dime, damn
Granny still holdin' up, sometimes she'll lose her mind
Had to catch myself sayin', ""Remember?"", damn well she don't remember '09
I threatened my homies, know damn well I'm lyin'
Don't switch your story, you know them niggas told on Nine
Can't hang with the mice
So high, I done came in her twice
Know a bitch suck dick for the Mikes
And I'm so legit with the ice

I stopped drinkin' lean with the ice
G-Wagon, I lean to the right
I move like a thief in the night
Some niggas don't use they pipes
Stop playin', you'll lose your life
Some niggas ain't cool with a slice
Four-five with a drum, they slide
When they slide, you hide

I let the streets get the best of me

I know some people in desperate needs
Gang hungry, I invest in we
Stayed in a home with no type of heat

I know one nigga who'll come out a Cut' just 'cause he ain't have no car
I know one nigga who'll sniff a perc just 'cause he ain't got no bars
I know one nigga told me stop singin', told me put out them bars
Why would I do that and that's one main reason I got these cars?
Nowadays crazy
They'll make you feel bad if you ain't got no job
Nowadays crazy
They don't teach you 'bout school, they'll teach you how to rob
Yeah, turn up
We ain't goin' back to be broke no more

You take one of mine we gon' take four (do-do-do)
Bitches screaming fake love like a Drake tour (turn up)
We gon' pull up in that truck and it's paid for (turn up)
How you flexing with your homie, shit it ain't yours (let's get it)
Cleaning pots inside the trap but I hate chores (gang)

Hitting that dope I gotta take dome (dome)

How the fuck you on top and you don't make noise? (gang gang)
I brought a hellcat from the trenches and I made it roar (skrt)

[Verse 2]
I can't put no niggas over mine, I'ma over grind
Over time, for more chains I'll over shine
I'm screaming free 'em even if appeals denied
Gave 'em guns just to get some lower time
Like drinking lean shit way too cold with ice
Kidnap your son got me like I'm Uncle Ice
Your ass ain't right, keep my strap like a dyke
They shot my brother, we was in it all night
They don't listen you ain't no politician
And I was broke ain't have no pot to piss in
Don't fuck with too many niggas had to keep my distance
When I do come around I swear I feel the tension
I love my cousin Iris man I swear I miss her
Her daughter look just like her I see her and kiss her
My daddy never seen my kids, only through some pictures
At the time I was fighting cases so I couldn't visit

Ain't no way that hate can overpower love (woah)
Ain't no money in the world that can buy you trust (woah)

While my baby mamas trippin', think they made my life a wreck (Ooh)
And they all thought I was tripping 'cause I said his ass a wreck (Ho)
Why they steady askin' for cash and they know they ass in debt? (Let's get it)
And that shit we did with 9, that shit first flight to the feds
They wanna kill us (Kill us)
Foenem geekin' off them dots, they wanna drill up (Drill up)
I know some niggas payin' rent, doin' fill ups
Before they talk to me, these niggas rather talk to pillows (Talk)
We talkin' to these trenches, niggas act like they don't hear
I throw my set up with that draco 'cause we bang
These niggas mad, they turned to opps 'cause they can't hang (Facts)
They tried to drag my name through mud 'cause they ain't gang (Facts)
They say they family but they don't understand my pain (Facts)
Told them old-heads, sit back, just don't get involved (Let's get it)
And that dope they got ain't sellin', they brought fentanyl (Bought fentanyl)
23 and 1, no visits, I ain't get a call (I ain't get a call)

And that gun I got, that shit don't even come in stocks (Brrah)
And that nigga I call my plug, his shit don't come in rocks (Don't come in rocks)

RondoNumbaNine, get you out of here (Woo)
I just turned the Gucci socks to a ski-mask
I stopped drankin' for a month, then I relapsed
Got my hood sewed up and I don't be there (I got dawgs)
Bought some chains for my niggas, what they be 'bout
Give a bitch 10 Gs when she leave out (Woo, woo)
Catch the bullet from the stick, cut your sleeves out
Going straight for the hit, then you ease out (Brr)
Do a U-turn, hit 'em up, then speed off (Speed off)
Ain't no lead, just somethin' to read 'bout

Roc gotta mop, he addicted to maintenance
No barber, but bro Nem be taping
Fly in that Bimmer with that steamer with K's

Go broke, have lil bro rob them

Voice of the streets, and if I say it, Varney stand on it
I speak my soul through my music, I'm so passionate
And if you thinkin' 'bout taking my chain, just know you would die with it
When them niggas count your pockets, you gotta watch that shit
I ain't have a pot to piss in, you did
You say this brother shit fell off, it did (Turn up)

[Verse 1]
I'm the brains and you the muscle, that's Varney still
And niggas really speak they mind off them Perky pills
They left me hanging and left me abandoned, that shit hurt me still
We fell off and it was a shootout, and I think they'll murk me still
In the studio smoking exotic, comin' up with new bars
I tried to stop it, I tried to stop it, that shit too far
Been around with my brothers, you give me endurance, I ride with two Glocks
And I'm thinking 'bout getting insurance, tryna do me like 2Pac
Ooh, it hurt my soul
Who gon' ride with you 'til the end?
Then again, you gotta watch out for your friends
They disrespect me on the 'net, don't pay it no 'ttention

Gotta be a snake to hang around you snakes
Boona gon' be straight, you know that's my lil' ace
If you play with my name, the streets gon' give you a taste
Just signed my deal with Bel-Air, fuck around and give you a case
Niggas low-key Chuck E. Cheese, tryna give you a case
A lot of pussies in these streets and I'll never embrace
You talking like you an OG and you can't get replaced
They wanna see your face in the casket, I told 'em leave your face
And I be thinkin' about my dawg until them Runtz gone
Until a nigga shoot that dome, it won't be much long
It's not a letter to the streets, it's just a love song
Lost Baby D to these streets, can't believe my cuz gone

A million a day, when I'm in the trap I feel like Frank Lucas (I'm feelin' like him)
I iced out the Rollies, and stepped out the place, I only eat sushi
You know what I'm sippin', you know what I'm grippin' (you know what's on call)
I'm all on that, boss niggas got passes I know that they crippin' (you know what I'm crippin')
Give 'em the fork and give 'em the bowl, I know they ain't whippin' (I know they ain't in the pot)
Durk he flew in, I brought him to the trap and showed him my vision (I showed him what's up)
My shooters no clubbin' (my shooters no clubbin')
My shooters straight thuggin' (they thuggin' forreal)
Your shooters, they bluffin'
They go the feds and give 'em discussions (they give 'em discussions)
Whip it up, whip it up, baby I'm up in the bowl (I'm up in the bowl)
Back then, show money on your head, he dead on the stove (he dead on the stove)

Oh! These niggas ain't gangstas
Stay tryna take my lil homie off the streets huh
Free 'Nine bitch!
We still got real niggas out here (so everybody gangsta now huh?)
Where you from nigga?
Free the guys man, you ain't from where we from
I told my niggas we gon' make it man
It's a fucking movement man
We a fucking family, we ain't a gang
OTF (Squad)

[Verse 1]
These niggas is bitches, getting info from bitches
Go and tell to the piggies
I'm tryna get riches, and stay on that business
Free bro, niggas snitching
My case almost over, you lucky one pending
I put 2 in his lemon, this 4-5 a lemon
Extended clip for his niggas
And he ain't shit to his niggas
We don't hesitate, from DeeDee and BayBay just know that the opps ain't never safe
Load up the Glock, and reload the 8
Do a drill on the op, no clones I see dots
ACG's, Free the Guys shirt, and one pair of rocks
I'm on the block
Hope my tape don't flop, and it go gold when it drop
I'm not a liar, start D'ing them baggies, and we risking indictment
Just to get flier than a first class ticket, United
300, O'block
Murder murder, kill kill, in the jam I'll never squeal
My label only time I deal
I fuck with G's, B's, Moes, Kings,  Snakes, 4's and the niggas under Neal
Silver spoon, you don't know how hunger feel
Dreaming 'bout 100 mil, step on that curb with 100 pills
Western Union money to bro and them, in the cell doing 20 years
And I lost a couple of these niggas, and they ain't never seen 20 years, oh
Bro died when I was out of town, shit happened I’m not around
Slide through every opp block and we up shots till they not around
What's up with this twitter beef?
Thought we was keepin' it in the streets?
They mad I'm in the winner seat, from the summer time 'till winter breeze
And choppa squeeze, bitch go blaat, blaat, blaat!
I ain't even gotta rap, (rap, rap) Rex nem in the trap (trap, trap)
One time no light bulb, bro n em got a lamp, (lamp, lamp)
Where you from you ain't stamped (stamp, stamp)
Niggas know we the champ (champ, champ)
Got niggas sneak dissin', it ain't rap
Make a real nigga gotta spit facts
Got some niggas saying keep it only rap
That's how these old niggas stay on the map
Headshot, we ain't getting into that
Niggas tellin' hands full of pens and pads
Grab a pack, blood bleeding real bad
Doin' hit in a coupe, in a Range, or an Audi
Fuck a nigga doubt me
All on my dick when they see me
Knowing this bitch wanna be me
Hell yea you can die over a retweet
I'm grabbing my pole on mimi
I can't see a nigga like Stevie
I won't tell, I'll take me a BG

You got statements on your dog, you a threat with the pen

And I drink a ginger ale, that’s what I take with my ten

Is you with me or you not but ain't gon’ say it again
Get a second chance with promises, don't break it again, oh

[Verse 1: TK Kravitz]
Baby, you know how I'm coming
I came up from nothing
That's why I can't fuck with you niggas who be fronting
If you my dawg, you my dawg for real, for you I kill
If I got it then you got it too, that's the deal
Just don't change on me, my nigga
My life can't get no bigger
I became a big spender
But you still don't get the picture
That money don't mean shit to me
That money don't mean shit to me

[Chorus: TK Kravitz]
I notice everybody love you when you got something to give (Everybody, I'm talking everybody)
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? (My rib!)
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
I lost so many niggas, I dropped a tear about 'em
We drop couple of their niggas, you don't hear about it
I tell my niggas I love them to death, that's on my dead body
I don't wanna give up my life to anybody
Think they finessing, Durk will not help 'em out
'Cause I want they ass to win and take a better route
Wish Law ain't take that fifteen, he ain't settle well
They get 'em off the street, they had to set 'em down

But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? (My rib!)
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
My momma said I don't love nobody but codeine
Trapping like a fool 'til my pockets obese
Real copped to ten murders, on the police
Gave him twenty years, still send him money every week
I feel like, we don't work, we don't care, we don't never speak
Told my team, ""Need plaques,"" so I don't never sleep
I'm forever real, I'm from the mud, believe
Can't struggle when I'm rich, I had to go and cheat

Remember when the homicide grabbed you
Boogieman had the trap like a drive thru
The coke is goin' quick like it's fast food
Booka told me D-rose lost his 9-1
Appeal money for them killas when that time come
Sneak dissin' what these goofy niggas dyin' from
One call I'll make my TV it'll slide up
I press 1JB 'cause Zoo was callin'
I press 7 'cause these goofys callin' (Let's get it!)
I fucked yo' bitch and took her Louis shoppin' (Ain't nothin'!)
Fucked yo' bitch and took her Louis shoppin'
I beat my case I keep my pistol on me (Let's get it, L's)
This nigga 'pose to been my man but he was snitchin' on me
And everytime he came around I was grippin' on it
Like fuck yo life I won't think twice and I'll blink you homie
We’ll turn your IG to an obituary
I just took couple of yo homies to a cemetery (Let's get it!)
And you know we did it you ain't did nothin' (Bitch)
DD in the jam and he ain't said nothin' (Let's get it, L's)
Can't name a fucking nigga that I ran from
Just made 60 thousand off a Samsung
Just put a couple bodies on my damn gun (grrah!)
And we carry draco's like they hand guns
Bitches want this glo', wanna be famous
Cummed inside her mouth I make her taste dick (Eater)
Them skinny bitches whine I make em' take dick
Might fuck her in the butt so she can stay thick
I lost my niggas to this shit that's why I'm solo homie (gang)
Uptown Miami hood and I was dolo homie
The streets will pull you back and forth like yo-yo homie
Like we ain't kill your mans and I don't know your homie

I can hear Yuyu calling (Chino)
I can hear L'A calling
Yeah, I can hear Pluto calling
I can hear Iris calling
I can hear J-Money calling
And I can hear O' calling
Yea I can hear Moe calling

All these niggas tried to diss me cause they had to (Gang)
Even if I was with my kids, know I had to
I got better fans I got better thoughts
Like shout out to them killas who was never caught
Niggas screaming gang gang yea they hella soft
I seen that shit happened thats a gimmick nigga (Fraud)
A hunnid for my jewelry for my image nigga (Lets get It)
In the field with my killas playing scrimmage nigga

[Verse 1]
When you wake up off them pills, that feeling terrible
The worst thing to be known is when they scared of you
And they gon' laugh right in your face when they ahead of you
And to be technical, that shit we do is federal
Holding tear backs from this life, it's so unbearable
You a copycat, that's not lean, that's Theraflu
I'ma jump from the top of my money with a parachute
And who you look up to a ho, I wouldn't dare salute
I keep taking care of my killers, they wouldn't care to shoot
I got your address from a bitch, that's for a pair of shoes
You got a text like, ""He got hit,"" that shit be scary news
They told me, ""Get up out the streets, you can go back to school""

[Bridge]
My life hurts so bad
Thinking 'bout if you was here, what kinda life you would have
Nowadays, the way we live, we live our life on the edge
Nowadays, the way we live, you would die if you scared, uh

[Chorus]
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
This life is for the ghetto
This life, this life, this life
[Verse 2]
Nobody put fear in us
I put real life inside this music, they not hearing us
I know what's real, I had some real killers tearing up
I did all I can for 'em, they not sincere enough
They stopped believing me way back then, they can't cheer with us, mmm-mmm
It get treacherous, that's why they don't mention us
Why you holding onto a snitch? Just give that victim up
They can't take care us alone, that's why they cliquing up
They told me to go pop and give the trenches up
I said fuck that shit, four killers inside a Bentley truck
It would've been five, but one of them died, his soul was given up
Wish I talked to him on the last call, told him live it up

[Bridge]
Where the love? Mmm, where the love?
You know it's tiring tryna clean blood from a rug
You know it's tiring watchin' my back and duckin' slugs
I know two robbers said they tired of sticking up

This life is for the ghetto

I ain't put that on they lawyer, they got them title
The way you wrote that statement, you a writer
Told on 'em in the station, gave 'em right up
DD did time with no lawyer, it's survival
I'ma cut your ass right off, hang with my rivals
Catch a case while you a felon, I'll say it's my gun
They got my picture in the feds, say I'm a Disciple
They say I switched up 'cause I don't believe in the Bible
First time on the head, I kept my eyes closed
Only nigga I'm scared of is John Doe
And no support 'll make your time slow
Just a real nigga without trying to

He ain't even know I was at her crib, I'm like damn, I'm dirty
Call Wook phone when I left, I said her pussy murder
Plus she stay next to the opps, I had to close the curtains
Fuck that bitch, suck a rich nigga dick

Watch me whip it like the nae nae dance,                                          car feeling like it's superman
15 thousand on the back end, all black on me like I'm batman
Ain't no robbin', that's a joke man

That's a drill in case it's bustin'
Bad bitches wanna touch herself
She just wanna make love or somethin'
Convos 'bout where're ya from
Super powers got me high too
Made it out cause I had to
Threw the Chi like a DM

Couple hundreds on my denims

Xans in my water, can't feel myself
I wish I had powers just to heal myself
Remember them nights I'd kill myself
And now I got thoughts just to be the best
The labels ain't believe me, had to prove myself
Dthang you know, nigga you was there
People left who said they wouldn't
For the niggas I lost I'd take a bullet
Run up on me now I wish you pull it
OTF my empire nigga without a cookie
30 fo' a show, tell them niggas book it
I'm tired of niggas lookin' at me like a rookie
Shark in the water on the deep end
House in the hills like the Weeknd
Only like to party on the weekend
Only like real, fuck pretend

Thank the Lord for my brothers

So she can be my super woman

Reminiscing 'bout your old life
It be feeling you gon' die
Certain shit ain't goin' right
Mansion on the hills, long way from scales
Steady tryna kill me, name ringin' bells
When you lose appeals, probably gon' tell
You done poppin' pills, they probably give you the chills
He lost fifty pounds probably in the mail
I gotta hold 'em down, shout out to the jail
Get hit up with some rounds, chopper make you frail
Shawty want a Draco, he don't want Chanel
Watch out for leeches, shootout, screechin'
Ducking polices, moving strategic
Voices, the voices, they say that I'm preaching
Went through them courses, they really ain't believe me
[Chorus]
Watch who you call your homie (Watch who you call)
Watch who you call your homie (Watch who you call)
Watch who you call your homie (Watch who you call)
Watch who you call your homie (Watch who you)
Watch who you call your brother (Watch who you call)
Watch who you call your brody (Watch who you call)
Watch who you call your brody (Watch who you call)
Watch who you call your brody (Watch who you call)

[Verse 2]
What you was doin' with your profit money?
I said you buy a nigga chain, they say you took it from him
The same bitches tryna fuck the ones who shitted on me
Wanna see the same nigga from back then who shitted on me
Wanna see the family members who turnt up and shitted on me
Wanna see them trap niggas who got money and shitted on me
Wanna see my teachers said I won't be shit, now I'm shittin' on em
I was too humble, now I'm cocky with that different money
You was chose, you was chose
Chose the right road, chose the right road

[Chorus]
Watch your homie
Watch your
Watch your homie, oh
Watch your

[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I hope his ass don't believe that rumor
I heard he was a snake, I wish I found out sooner
He left his killers, but I stayed and groomed 'em
But I hope he don't listen to that rumor
I turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh

[Verse 1: YNW Melly]
I gave you all I had and you just did me wrong
I can't fuck with these hoes, they only like my songs
You know we keep that Henny in the styrofoam
And free my nigga Trell, I swear he bomin' home
Locked up inside the cage, but it won't be for long
These niggas talkin' shit, ain't put they people on
You know what time it is, you know we equal, dawg
I thought you was gon' ride, but baby, not at all
I can't believe what you had did
You really scarred a nigga, hurt me to my ribs
The way I am, the way I feel
Like it ain't too many that can keep it real
I'm with the gang, they're used to pain
This .40 can't help you, you need Novocaine
Who ridin' for me? I don't even know
One day it all gon' show
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I hope his ass don't believe that rumor
I heard he was a snake, I wish I found out sooner
He left his killers, but I stayed and groomed 'em
But I hope he don't listen to that rumor
I turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Ooh, this shit not right, fucked around and missed my flight
I went to Tootsie's twice, like I ain't have no wife
Opps said I'm ridin' 'round, they say I'ma die tonight
They tryna put me down, I gotta keep my pipe
But I gotta see better days, get a big check, gotta elevate
Had to throw my cup away, everyday I was sippin' on a cup of eight
Niggas wasn't with me from the start, niggas left me when it got hard
And I had my bro with me, but he caught a body and he got charged
He a killer, oh, pitiful, oh
Leave me alone, leave me alone
Asked the streets could it be my Valentine, but they tired of dyin'
They been killers since '99, oh, oh, they tired of cryin'
I just wanna hit that road, I'm tired of flyin'
Tryna file your friends' kids, oh, make tax a crime
Umbrella-ella-ella-ella, ayy
He a killer, killer, killer, killer, ayy
Committin' crimes
[Chorus: Lil Durk]
I hope his ass don't believe that rumor
I heard he was a snake, I wish I found out sooner
He left his killers, but I stayed and groomed 'em
But I hope he don't listen to that rumor
I turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh
Turned him to a killer, oh-oh

How you feel though? V's up, keep it trill though
Oh yeah, one time, oh yeah, one time

This is Durk
Better known on the Southside of Chicago
And throughout the midwest as Lil Durk's father
As it started out I had a life sentence
For the stool pigeon who told on me
And I been doing that time for 22 years now
Alhamdulilah by the grace of Allah
I got that blessing and won that appeal
And now I'll be out in a few years
To be with my boy, to be with my sons
To be where I'm supposed to be in life
And do the things I'm supposed to do as a father
As always, for those who in the struggle
For those who in this system
For those who in the state's system
Keep ya head, keep fighting
Cowards, rats, don't never win over real dudes
So keep ya head up soldier
And we gone keep on letting thing continue to flow
And we'll get out an do what we supposed to do as men
And hold our own
And be the fathers we supposed to be
Be the men of the community we supposed to be

[Intro 2: Lil Durk]
Haha, I tried to get that in
Got JDR on the 1's and 2's
I want yall to follow this shit. Ya dig?
I put him in his glo, he put me in mine
You know how we do it. L's!
Got Juice in this bitch with me, Carlito
(shhhhhing)
[Verse 1: Lil Durk]
Off the rage in Chicago to kill
Stay duckin' hollows, fu shit
On my block where it get too real
One nigga doing 2 drills
J-Money love the blue steel
L'A bussin' off 2 pills
My niggas too trill
300 niggas too real
300 niggas too real (Yeah)
Pluto be t'ed off the Remy
Think he a Migo off the Remy
I think I'm Nuski with the semi
He still got the strap, niggas trippin'
And I'm hard body, man I miss him
Chino dead not to mention
I was in the studio coolin' sippin'
And they told me stay in the kitchen
Don't be loafin' with these bitches
Don't put trust into these niggas
Beto gang will get you missin'
J-Rock keep saying he miss 'em
Iris dead that's my first cuz
My first blood
The one I love and I miss you
(Let's get it! Let's get it!)
Rest in piece to OD
O Block went OC
600 beef with Baldie
Get these lames up off me
And Tay and Buda shocked me
If I was there they would have shot me
(Yeah)
[Bridge: Lori Perri & Lil Durk]
Day after day
Seems like I push against the clouds
(I need everybody to pour out some liquor out,)
They just keep blocking out the sun
(For everybody that y’all lost... Fuck it roll up! Haha!)
It seems since I was born
(I’m pourin’ my lean!)
I've waken every blessed morning
(Uhhhhhhh uh-woah!)
Down on my luck and up against the wind

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
They ain't deserve it
I'm out all night and ain't worried
Mama trippin' got a nigga nervous
I'm just sippin' drivin' steady swervin'
Bullets catch 'em quick
Hollows burn 'em
Twitter niggas steady talkin', Murder
Call my lawyer nigga, I ain't heard it
Call my lawyer nigga, I ain't heard it
You'll make the news where I come from
Rap but you get the Blues where I come from
Shoot a tec, you on a cruise where I come from
Get killed out the blue where I come from
Because, niggas ain't keep it too real
Niggas ain't keep it too trill
That's why I got me like 2 deals
I'm tryna chase me 2 mil
Free Rondo, his bond is 2 mil
And I got money I'm chillin'
3 Children
Get money invest into buildings
My nigga we got it we 'round each other
My nigga we buildin'
Niggas be tweakin' get money
Lil nigga chill out on that killin'
The murder capital so ridiculous
I swear I was grindin' for dimes and nickels
I swore I'd never drop a dime on a nigga

Want a war? I'll never waste time on a nigga
Let's Get It! let's get it

I'm saying they count us out at the right time
You know what I'm saying
That gave us motivation to tuck and gotta do what we do
You know what I'm saying I got the city on my back you know

[Chorus]
I came from public houses to a mansion
I lost my family I was feelin' stranded
I seen my son he a throw a tantrum
Call a couple bitches cause I had no manners
I asked Allah can he give me guidance
Full of anger I was in out my mind and
I know this music is my soul passion
Last week I spent fifty thousand on my fashion

[Verse 1]
On red carpet feelin' like Alladin
Got a bitch from Tokyo I like her accent
Julio Jones ballin' on 'em, Madden
On top enjoy my risin'
Smokin' woods like I'm in a cabin
Goin' broke I cannot imagine
No way, how you blastin' if you plastic
Imma turn wit da cheque get my momma a new crib
I ain't talking Kodak Black Imma get a new crib
I just paid for my side bitch to get a titties filled
And she tried to suck me up for them new Fendi heels
I been in it for a long time need some new deals
I been in 4gs it for a long time need some new wheels
Percocet with the Xanax, need some new pills
Traded in that new Hellcat to see a coup wheel
Turn up

I'm with Zoey on the jet skis
Can’t wife no hoes, on Nuski
Two cars Imma switch keys
Fuck the old heads they miss lead
Only the family stand for family
I lost my blood that's insanity
Shout out Tory cuz he signed to me
I'm wit a boss bitch count them gs
Count my cheese up
Got a passport she got a Visa
It's perfect picture Mona Lisa
They didn't believe us
Hope they never need us
While the police try to discriminate us
And I got these diamonds just to please my haters
Gotta get this money gotta chase that paper
While these niggas try to assassinate us
I got a Glock and it came with lasers
