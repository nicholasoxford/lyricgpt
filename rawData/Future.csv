Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm

We order more bottles and fuck on more models and pass 'em around

I just dived inside a cutie, we spoonin'
Take it back and take a look at yourself
Take the lesson, put it all in the air
Too many days gone by
Sittin' by the phone, waitin' 'til I reply
Drying my eyes, believe it or not
I could never see a tear fallin'
Water drippin' on me like a faucet
I just took a bitch to eat at Chipotle
Spent another sixty thousand on a Rollie
All my diamonds got you brainwashed
She sucked my dick, it got my brain washed

Told my mama she should pray on it
Told the streets they gotta wait on it
She gon' put a nigga name on it
I just dropped a whole thang on it

That's U.S. dollars that you can't achieve
Fucked my white girl, she said, ""Nigga, please""

Playin' poker, now we're back in Stroker
I forgot her name but her pussy soakin'
When I seen her on the pole
Reminded myself when I used to come over
Reminded myself when I used to get loaded
Remindin' myself that I'm still gettin' loaded

I'm putting my heart and my soul in this shit and some more

Strapped in the 'Lac and the Hummer
Fronted a pack to my partner

Fuck the fame, I'm sipping lean when I'm driving
All this cash and it ain't nowhere to hide it
I'm an addict and I can't even hide it

We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

Bitch, I'ma choose the dirty over you
You know I ain't scared to lose you
They don't like it when you're telling the truth
I'd rather be realer than you
I had to make me a cot
Now I called a contractor to make me a spot
I sold the dope out your house
Now you come to my house, I've got dope in the couch
You know I don't fuck with no rumors
Rocking red bottoms like they Pumas
Got these meds on me, I'ma do 'em
I take these pills and I'm having a thrill
Taking prescription's a hell of a feeling
As for the xanny, I never forgot it
Got 'em begging to call up my phone tryna have a menage
Gotta put up the cash, can't even stay in the house
Cause there’s too much to hide
Whip the four to a nine, gotta pay up the rent, I was too far behind
Fuck I'm too out of time, fuck 'em two at a time
Had to do what I had to do to get where I'm at, niggas know I ain't lying
Niggas know I ain't lying
It's a lot on my mind, it's a lot on my plate
But I never complain
I was working the weight like I came out the gym
I never did train
Put the girl on a train
Strapped a bird on her back, now she came back with change, ayy

I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out

I just had some bitches and I made 'em lip lock
I just took a piss and I seen codeine coming out
We got purple Actavis, I thought it was a drought

[Verse 2]
I strapped the dope to your spouse
The first time I gave her an ounce
I put some free bands in her account
I told her, ""Bitch, can't be running your mouth
Better watch what you say to these niggas
Cause you already know what they 'bout""
Put the game in a choke in a knot
Hit that bitch while I'm choking her out
Put that hook on her, now she got love in the south
I got some purp on me now
Stacking these styrofoams up by the double
They done let me back in, now they know they in trouble
Valet the whip by the front door
On a percocet now and I need me some more
Tell me them lies that you want me to hear
I try to forget, but it's hard to forgive
Take me some codeine and pop me a pill
I pull on a blunt and blow smoke out my ears
I smoke on this blunt, I get high as I can
I float off the Earth in designer
I’m working on having some manners
I’m thinking about it right now
I’m holding the cash while I pour up the lean
Then I put one in the air

Get it, nigga? I nose better, put a smile on the devil's face
Who don't wanna sell dope forever
And flood their Rollie till the bezel break?
Woo! Fish scale in the two-door that I fish-tails
Fiberglass, Ferrari leather, in designer shit that I misspell
YUGHH! Look at the clues
The J's, the jewels, I'm actin' a monkey
From 16 years old, I'm whippin' in kitchens, fuckin' my junkies
Pablo, Versace way before Migos
My dinner plates, no silverware, all you niggas my hijos
Toss a kilo like a free throw, crack house, it had the peephole
Made it through to the other side
Now nothing's big as my ego, Push

[Verse 3: Pharrell]
Me, I try to leave the best for later
But Pusha tried to put me on the respirator
The old Skateboard P, that's your favorite
Me and twenty girls doin' yoga naked
Frequency high, like a spaceship
She say that she like it and she's been exposed
The Gandalf hat and the weird ass clothes
That's Comme des Garçons and the Buffalo
I know guerrillas with the triggers that's on a banana clip
And packin' with the biggest missiles
These niggas is knocking over vehicles
These niggas ain't waitin' just to see niggas
These niggas ain't tryna hear plea, niggas
These niggas like choppin' down trees, niggas
These niggas 1-2-3 and they squeeze, niggas
These niggas hit the weed then they lean niggas, gee, nigga
If you got two hoes, you need to let one go
Two Lambos, you need to let one go
All these drones while y'all smoke dro
There's an eye in the sky, I'm tryna let y'all know

Young nigga got that coke, whip that dope like a bad child
How you think about that coupe with no roof?
Young nigga cashed out
Popped so many Percs, popped so many Xans
Young nigga 'bout to pass out
12 jump behind me, I got some in the car
Young nigga 'bout to smash out
Migo hit that line, say he got some bricks
Young fresh 'bout to buy 'em out
QuikTrip 'round the corner, dropped a nine
Got the J's in the lunch line smokin' iron
Cocaine, cocaine cowboy, like Mickey Munday
Take over the project, whip a line, me no wait
I keep a .45 in my coat while I'm servin' dope
The J's in my hood smoke that crack, say it give 'em hope
Serve a nigga whole brick, he hopin' that it come and go

Sippin' on lean, getting higher
Nigga, I'm a codeine buyer
No, you not a foreign whip driver
Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Hundred dollars fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit 'em in the head, can you keep it solid?
Bulletproof whip, we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut dope, blow it up
Represent your gang, nigga, throw it up
I don't give a fuck where you at, nigga, throw it up

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags (Shit!), nigga, you ain't bought shit (Shit!)
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles (Shit!), nigga, you ain't popped shit (Shit!)
All you talk 'Nana clips (Shit!), nigga, you ain't shot shit (Shit!)

[Verse 2]
Catch a nigga slippin' at the red light
With ya AK, let me see you shoot it
You a goon, you a goon, you a goon, you a goon
Nigga, let me see you prove it
Presidential Rollie and it's glidin'
Love a nigga wrist when it's shinin'
Hate a nigga wrist when it's blingin'
So I went and added more diamonds
Hot Boy, nigga, BG
That's the way these young niggas eat
Drinking on syrup, can't sleep
Keep it copacetic with your partner
Blockbuster niggas running 'round with real choppers
Nigga, what's the color of them bottles? they ain't gold
And you moving 'round with ya ho
You ain't even sticking to the code
Pimps up, pimps up, Hoes down (Hoes down)
A pool full of money and I'm 'bout to drown
I'ma fool on the corner with that Bobby Brown
Button up suits at the Grammys
Had to turn it up for the family
Yes, I'm a Freeband bandit

[Chorus]
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles, nigga, you ain't popped shit
All you talk 'Nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spending money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Talkin' 'bout you poppin' tags (Shit!), nigga, you ain't bought shit (Shit!)
Talkin' 'bout a hunnid bottles (Shit!), nigga, you ain't popped shit (Shit!)

[Verse 1]
Is that her in the VIP-line
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don’t want ‘er cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man, the owner
And don't even drink Carona's
What type of drink you want bruh
On champagne forever
On dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you’d like to change the weather
If you wanna live better
We can buy a crib, where ever
Don’t get too thirsty, get used to the cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I’ve met ‘er

[Hook]
Turn on the lights

Tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er in the broad day
Hangin’ with the dope boys in the hallways
And I know, to keep ‘er, yeah you gotta get that pay
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she got a pretty face and stand up like a stallion
I heard that she a precious jewel, you treat her to medallions
I wanna be the one to find out if I go to prowlin
And if I get her number, you know I can’t wait to dial it
And if we get together, girl, you know we gon be wildin
And when we get together we make magic and it’s ours
Whenever you up here, ain't nun nobody can do about it

She a hood girl
But she a good girl
She been mislead
Now she ready for the world
I want your energy
To take control of me
I’ve tried to go to sleep
And seen ‘er in my dreams
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
Just in case you recognize her face, send ‘er to me
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon

I did fifty-six broads on the European tour and they was all crazy

I took fifty-six bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand, man this shit real crazy

I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation

Money keep a nigga motivated
Molly keep a nigga motivated
Percocet keep 'em motivated
Good drank keep a nigga motivated
Lortabs on my conversation
Talk a lot of bands then we conversatin'
I was on my way to Rice Street
In the paddie wagon and it had me numb
The pain from the slum had me numb
Tryna sell some dope and eat caviar
Got the passport in Saudi Arabia
We've been flossing in medallions
We ain't nothing but some Talibans
I pull up right now and embarrass ya
I've just been hanging with savages
Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I grew up on the block, one hunnid
I go on The Bluff, it's one hunnid
I done did enough in the jungle
I done put in some work and they love me
When I drink out the cup, it's so dirty
Had the blow at the store, they was lurking
Poured a four in a cup it was breakfast
Sprinkled sauce in my drink and I took it

[Verse 2]
Promethazine took my concentration
To another level then I elevated
Diamonds hanging on me I'm intoxicated
Diamonds hanging off me I'm intoxicated
Chop it up with a sack chaser
Told you I wasn't going back, baby
Hanging out with some crack babies
Fell in love with this cash baby
Money touch a niggas hands
On a few Xans might won't count it
Spend it all in one night
If we could rewind it, we'll still do it
I'm true to this game, I jump on a plane
And run to the stage
I've been working some years for this
Making music, I live for this
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
Mount it up then I smash out in it
You know I'm gon' do the whole dash in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
I'm 'bout to pass out in this motherfucker
This bitch exotic than a motherfucker
These bitches  do anything for me

Never falling off and never quit

Knock 'em off on tape, that's murder on film
I need better thoughts, I need better vibes
Focus on the top and let my nigga slide
I need more advice and ain't got no time
Hustlin', do right, feel like I waited a lifetime
Weigh up both sides 'cause your life ain't like mines
Pay me no mind, I ain't payin' no fine
Everything I did was for my hood this whole time
I'm talkin' this whole time, for my hood this whole time
Gotta take advantage, gotta learn how to take advantage, dog
Stole a golf cart, I go and buy a ballpark
Drove a stolen car and now my car a push start
I'm from the apartments, my crib big like Wal-Mart

I can hear the purple callin'

Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
Got a young bitch pulling up in a 'Vette
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch nigga get money, nigga, get back
Roll a blunt of chronic, nigga sell a lot of crack
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
I can whip a Maserati, pulling up a donk
50 thousand on yo watch, young nigga, splurge
Pop a Ace of Spade bottle, sip a lot of syrup
Keep a young nigga workin', gotta buss a cape

Young bitch looking like Janet in the '80s

Tell that bitch, ""Leave me the fuck alone!""
See, you fuck her wrong, and I fuck her long

I'd rather pop a ollie and my dick is a trolley
Boy, I'll bury you like Halle
And these hoes say I'm blind
'Cause I don't see nothin' wrong with a little bump and grind
Man, I just received a package

And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home, man, that nigga must be snitchin'

Sippin' on Easter Pink like it's Tanqueray
We ain't never gon' give this perfect life up
I know the boys saying they gettin' to the money over there
Baby, trust me, these niggas nothin' like us
I put charisma in my lingo and she fell for me
I gave her realness, and that’s all she gonna get from me
Bona fide superstar, I'm straight up out the hood-uh

Got a chain hangin' over me

Got some money all in my hand and I stack it all under me

Help me fight my demons off, know the usual
I had put a chopper in her name and a Ruger
She hang on the block where I hang like a shooter
Throwed away a cougar, she didn't wanna leave
Treat her like garbage, my heart was on my sleeve
Should've chose better with your company at least
Why should I have love for her if you can get it out the creep?
Why should I have trust for you? You ain't get it out the creek
Why should I have love for you? You ain't kneelin' to my feet
Why should I be carin' when I know I can't be beat?
See how the ice be glarin' when I come through and retrieve
It's easy to know it's us if a body in the street
Too turned up and the plug talk Swahili
After I pay my taxes, I go Richard Mille
In another tax bracket, you niggas beneath me
Who causin' a racket in Jamaica on the weekend?
Half a ticket on vacation, I ripped up the receipt
And she call me daddy 'cause my money long like Stevie
Stay down with my son, right or wrong, FBG shit (Freebandz)
How you gon' be gang? You bang if you rich, what's in your bloodline?
Come in with some Talibans, everythin' gettin' gunned down
Halloween gang in this bitch, shit gettin' scary
Three hundred thousand for the cheapest ring, cost a Bentley truck, I'm legendary, lil' bitch
Hot, off the thermometer, lil' bitch
Hotter than fish grease, lil' bitch
My ring cost a big B as well as my wrist
I'm gettin' money like this, can't tell problems exist
I wake up fresh every day like I'm goin' to take a pic
Hermes hit my main line 'cause they know I'm lit
Stuffed a hundred-fifty racks in your purse, lil' bitch
And when I wake up, go surf in your pussy, hit

Say she wanna eat sushi, I gave her enough to go shoppin'

Do a little time out the country, I need this

Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe

[Verse 1]
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
'Sco came to me, said, ""They think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one""
We going back in soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him into custody, they took my life away

People didn't even understand that
My hard drives that I recorded all my music on
For two years straight was on this...
Was on this one hard drive that Esco had
And he was locked up with it
So I had to record new music
That's when I did Beast Mode

I'm fresh off the plane on them Zaytiggys
I endured so much pain, ain't got 'Sco with me
Ain't got nobody to smoke one or pour with me

And I'm still dealin' with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
And my lifestyle getting way bigger

Got an R&B chick layin' on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doin' some real life porno

Left eighty racks in the dresser, you can keep
And I got this bad ting at disposal
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
Can't be the one and then you get exposed
If you the one, then God will let me know
But at the same time, I like to vibe with one
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
And I had to 'splain to her last night
Had to send this one freak on the last flight
[Segue]
Had to send this one freak on the last flight

[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection

[Verse 2]
Standin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock
Icin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock
Yeah, maybe it's the drop, yeah, we get in our feelings, yeah
I don't know how you would feel about if I ain't have millions, yeah
I'm conversin' with you, I hope you hear me, yeah
Keep my promise, take my love with you everywhere
And hell no, it ain't about no braggin' rights
But even if it was, shit, I got it
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
I'ma keep it genuine and tell the truth to you
I got this jawn, she know what to do with me
And right now I don't know what to do with you
I don't wanna sound like I'm bein' rude with you
She caught a red eye, leavin' L.A
I shoulda gave her to the valet
And I had to tell her 'bout Miami
After she came with no panty
[Chorus]
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection20Embed"

Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you

[Verse 1]
I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Hard to say you care about me
When this mink draggin' to the floor
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
I breathe the air she breathes
It's hard to breathe on my own
It's somethin' 'bout infidelity
Make me check every single stone
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
Made her switch sides in Ibiza
I can get you off in Belgium
Diamonds shinin' off very seldom
Grab a couple chickens, then mail them
Take 'em to the hood, then sell them
Fam come first, you never fail them
Rebellious, always respect my elders
That's why I might treat you like I'm careless
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
If I open up my eyes, it turn black for real
Pack was too small, I ain't have it vacuum sealed
Word to Uncle Charles, nigga I got the sack for real
Money, broads, lawyers cost a half a mil'
Fame change, the family loves the way it is
Fame change, a ho loves the way I give
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal

Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you

Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you

[Verse 2]
It can get scary when you legendary
Caramel complexion, that's a Halle Berry
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
Grab the fuckin' carbon, hit him with the tool
I'm not tryna argue, I got issues
You see what I've been put up against, baby
You see why I've been tryna make the rent, baby
Tryna keep you closer than lint, baby
Dime rose, 'bout to get lynched, baby
It's hard to caress you
All your bad energy, it's hard to bless you
Commercial flights gettin' too hectic
V12 motors, my confession
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
I'm a real nigga, it's hard to accept me

Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way

Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Shawty so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Work every day like I got somethin' to lose
Oxycont' got me flown up, nothin' new
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Styrofoam cups, everything is approved
Money stacked up and it got me seduced
I got that hot dope, but I got that boost though
Ayy, my Lamb hit a pothole
These bitches some thot hoes
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Yacht party, sittin' at the dock of the condo
Better not be late, bitch, you better come pronto!
Better come with a combo
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, mi casa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
It became problems when I didn't send flowers
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Goshies and Rollies, yeah, fuck all the police
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
My wrist got an ego, my watch in an igloo
We took illegal, got stripes like a zebru
Pimp like a rollin' stone, high when I greet you
Diamonds just fall on you, effortlessly ball on you
L-O-to-V-E, hope you ain’t get greedy
Chasers do numbers, man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped your heart 'cause you gave it too easy
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
Shout out to DiDi, got goonies on speedy
She like it rated, ain't nothin' 'bout her PG
I had it, made it, I thought I was jaded
Persian, Malaysian? Super sensation
Yah, sushi was raw when she got confiscated
No invitations, we showed up and made it
Long as my dawgs here, bitches betrayed me
Pigeons contagious, I shoulda known it
I turned the pages, heavily sedated
Too many clone me, too many phonies
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
Spendin' all your show money tryna keep up with my image
Fuck around, take a O from me, and never give a penny
Fuck y'all, I skrrt off, 'cause everything shitty
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
Caught her off the runway, she instantly committed
Paper got my mind gone, too caught up on my city
In and out of time zones, runnin' up a billi'
Indian Cherokee, clarity, shinin' is therapy
Mami Israeli (Mami Israeli)

You know how we be rocking, ya heard

[Verse 1]
Bright light shining all bright on the Bentley
Work the Cadillac, panoramic, no panties
Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, 'cause you know I'm getting at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't do it to yourself, that's tragic
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
The way a nigga look 'round here, they'll back stab you
Word from your motherfucking brother, young nigga
I just wanna see you happy, I just wanna see you happy
Coming through the cut like a known Grim Reaper
'Bout to get it straight finessed, tryna get a little cheaper
Hold on to that clip like a doped up needle
Girl hang on that strip with a four Desert Eagle

[Chorus]
Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'Fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Man down over yonder
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
They done took a boss out nigga, no wonder
Niggas getting crossed out nigga, no wonder
Hoes getting X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
Niggas' true to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
[Verse 2]
Had the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
Niggas swimming in the water, no paddle
Niggas trying to walk in my shadow
The bird on the bezel, I'm a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella
Told a young nigga Freebandz, Roc-A-Fella
You can turn this off and I can kick it acapella
We work the Front Street where Mama said, ""Don't go""—we went there
Trap house embalmed with that crack, then we went there
Shawty don't fuck with these folks
These niggas be telling these days, be telling these days

[Chorus]
Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Ayy, where ya mans at? Heard that the feds got 'em
I seen you cruise the Land Rover through the west side
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got them wolves out, rock a little Cartier
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain't gon' see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind

[Verse 1: Drake]
Took niggas out the hood like I'm from there
So you know it's all good when I come there
I hear you talk about your city like you run that
And I brought my tour to your city, you my son there, nigga
But I had to come through for the remix
On my haven’t-done-a-verse-in-eight-weeks shit
And if a nigga say my name, he the hot shit
But if I say the nigga name, he still the hot shit
Fucked up, lucky I don't feed into the gossip
Niggas act like they don't know, but they should know
Yeah, I just think it's funny how they dangling the bait
But I'm the one that's killing niggas on the hooks, though
And niggas ain't got a grill, still ice-grill hating
I know y'all already know Mike Will Made It
Just looking at the numbers, nigga, I feel amazing
I'll call Michael Jordan up and Mike will make it
I'm the young rap nigga with the 'Melo deal
You need to come to OVO for a better deal
Just know a million ain't shit once you get a mil'
And niggas say it’s all good
That’s how you better feel, nigga, nah!
Fuck that, this year I'm talking big stuff
Rolling through the city like a young nigga bricked up
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas
That's why we never gave a fuck
When a fuck nigga switched up, damn!

Told myself I don't wanna fall in love with you

Can you stretch it out? Stretch it out for me
I got somewhere to be, but it's hard to leave
When you do it like you mean it, I'm proceedin'
Is you the one? Is you the one?

I bought some VVS and she caught the chain flu
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Yah, I was sippin' my codeine from the beginnin'
She jocked my whole team, she seen who's winnin'
We light Liv up on a Sunday, come see us livin'
This for my dogs on the one way in penitentiaries
Send a direct hit, you gotta pay attention
I just lit my wrist up, I need some more attention
She didn't wanna play fair, I put her on suspension
I put a ki on Greyhound now I'm in a new dimension
Offered her 25, keep tryin' to take some of my percentage
I was petrified, you know my right wrist authentic
I get glorified, that Richard Mille cost 250
I'm a big dog, it ain't no sense in holdin' back
On my Usain Bolt shit, I ran up in yo' set
Fuckin' with them strippers all in G5
And as soon as the club closed we board the G5
I got scammers and junkies lined up on each side
I got five percent tint on each side
I tried to make it outta school on the East Side
I'm on my Nicky Barnes shit, so it's fuck school

My savages, my savages, my savages
I'm always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I'm on the phone with Yo, I ask him how the trial went
Thirty-five racks is how my day was spent
I gotta cock it back, that's how my day would get
You got me thinking all these bitches artificial
The way you acting, you must don't respect a real nigga
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
They tried to infiltrate us and then betrayed us
I told you way before what happened, they was hating on us
You know when we was jugging for it they was mad at us
Ayy, this a letter for my dawgs, how we let the money get between us?
How we let these bitches get between us?
How we let these niggas get between us?
I got love for all my savages with itchy fingers
I got love but it ain't like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
My lil' dawg caught a murder, gone for infinity
Dumping ashes on your obituary, I know you feeling me
R.I.P. my granddad Quick, he should have seen this shit
Twenty thousand on some child support, I seen this shit
Riding around with all them choppers, I done seen this shit
These rappers mad at me, but these niggas ain't doing shit
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
I went and spent a half a ticket at the dealership
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn't love me, would've been done jumped ship
And it's the love from my fans got me still here

Said fuck that shit, poured up a four
Ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me?
That what you really expect?
You thinking I'm sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
I hate I had to fuck with any of you niggas, that's my only regret
Drag the mink on the floor
Put Cuban links on my ho
Ten whips in a row, who would think we were poor?
Who would think we was poor?
There's money laying on the floor
Got some hoes laying on some hoes
Got lil' shawty with me, she a pro
Know she'll never meet another nigga, not another nigga like me
Even if he got a billion dollars, he can't make her cum like me
Who compliment you like me? It better be about an image
Tell me all of this a gimmick, they thought the whips got rented
Because the Spur wasn't tinted, I told 'em ain't got nothing to hide
Told 'em I'm through with the pies
Told 'em fuck all of my wrongs, I don't even write
My savages, my savages, my savages
We gon' leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin

Free all my niggas incarcerated, you heard me?
Loyal for life, you heard?

(Wheezy outta here)

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
With a bitch that's shinin', lookin' like the moon
Said she wanna party, wanna let it loose
Bustin' out my back room, she ain't out the loop
It's jumpin', let it in (Ooh)
I put it out, they come in (Ooh)

[Verse 1: Future & Travis Scott]
Came up off a brick
Bought a Richard Mille, my new watch don't tick
Drippin' in Louis V, made a movie, and Prada another film
It's the Don Dada, I stand this Lamborghini on one wheel
Twelve o'clock, and I got my gun clocked, and I'm on one pill
Monday all the way to Sunday, pick a time to drill
Gettin' my lettuce, I'm gettin' my paper, I'm gettin' my trees (Woo, woo)
One thousand percent, keep it one thousand with me (Woo, woo, yeah)
Started with my squad, so I can't chill
Money over bitches, gotta play the field
Coronavirus diamonds, you can catch the flu
Trap in bandos, walk in Jimmy Choo
Solitaries made a rockstar too (Ooh)
Solitary diamonds, I can show proof (Ooh)
That these bitches on me just like a pop group
I got racks on my mind and I can't lose (Yeah)
And I got solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Watches full of baguettes, pockets full of blue (Yeah)
Solitary diamonds, solitary jewels
Girls gettin' naked in my swimming pool (Yeah)
I wanna take care you and your friends (Yeah)
[Refrain: Travis Scott]
Ooh
I put it out, they come in
Ooh (It's lit)
Radical decisions what we always choose
All the dogs is hungry and they sellin' food (Yeah)
Every time we do it, tend to hit the news
I don't want it if it's stiff or if that pussy loose
Runnin', know they gunnin' 'cause I got the juice
I been thuggin' since a youngin, brought that work to school
Floodin' all the hundreds, we done broke the pool
All this money bring the power, I didn't make the rules (Let's go)

[Verse 2: Future & Travis Scott]
Sipping on codeine got my screws loose
Making all this money got my screws loose (Yeah)
Ridin' Lamborgini made her pussy juicy
Grippin' on the wheel, playin' in her pussy
Diamonds on my neck been going crazy
I think I need to see a psychiatrist (Ooh)
Living in the streets and the gutter raised me
I know how to sell narcotics (Yeah)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
When they let us off of lock', man, we gon' make that shit pop
Been humpin' wifey for so long, she got a limp when she walk
Got seven drops in four spots, I get to pick where I live
In the back they playin' twinsies like a Hugh Hefner zoo
On my teeth, these diamonds twinkle, in her legs a jacuzzi
I be tweakin' every day, I got some screws missin'
I keep an Air Max pump on me, no, not my 270s (Yeah)
And they know just where I be, it's like I'm 713 (Yeah)
Havin' money on this side is not the conversation (Yeah, yeah)
Solitary diamonds for my dawg inside, he waited, yeah (Straight up)

You'll get rich and have problems that you never thought
It bring tears knowin' we came up out the sandbox
(Bringin' tears to my eyes)
Made it out the trenches, it got harder for my niggas
I just wanna see my dawgs ball, seven figures
I done got rich and it cursed me
Ever since I got successful, they envy
Tryna shake the devil, on promethazine
Tryna show you love but you don't feel me
Gave up on me so you turned your back
I can see the demons 'cause a nigga been blessed
I can tell you worried, but a nigga been in debt
I can't get caught up inside the matter
I should've did better, but it's chatter
I ran up my money off the gravel
Love is just a word, it don't matter to me
I got so rich, nothing matters to me
I'm livin' my second life, it's so amazin'
I done been hit with a bullet, and one grazed me
I done been considered a failure, it don't faze me
I done came up out the ghetto, my crib gated
Same niggas played with the devil, these niggas hatin'
All these bitches fuck with no rubbers, this shit brazy
Icy-ed out the Hublot, these niggas lookin' fugazi (Yeah)
Money stack tall past the ceilin', I can't be jaded
I done came from sleepin' on floors, you can't persuade me (Yeah)
I been takin' other niggas' hoes, it's gettin' outrageous (True story)
Rich nigga gettin' caught with a bitch worth minimum wages (Pluto)
Fuckin' with my ego, but I never lost a lady (Facts)
Fucked a pop star after I got my dreads braided
Never dropped her name but her head game contagious (No cap)
Twenty percent of my dames, I shipped 'em right out to Vegas (Gone)
You can feel the pain when I'm rappin' 'cause I'm ragin' (Wizard)
You can see my past and where I was on they faces (Weak)
I done flipped the truck over and crashed, ducked the agents (Facts)
I been with these blue hundreds like a nigga racist (Freebandz)
I been gettin' richer each year, feel like I'm racin' (Gone)
Tried to tell you the formula but you wouldn't take it
Hard work and perseverance, they ain't related (Ain't related)
Poppin' up on Forbes is fuckin' up my relations (Fuckin' up my family)
Ten milli' plus on a crib and it's vacant (Woo)
I can see it vividly at the crib, Rico basement  (Woo)
Watch him get the mula, I was sittin' back bein' patient (I was bein' patient)
I was sittin' back, programmin' my brain, I was in trainin' (Yeah)
I be in my coupe, Maybach, and I ain't have to trade it (Skrrt-skrrt)
Thinkin' 'bout when I was posted up when they raided (Swear I was)
Now I Double R and Ghost it up, I feel spacious (Woo)
I don't feel the safest, but I feel gracious (Yeah)
I thank God every day, I don't feel basic
Probably lose my sanity if I ain't have my babies (Sheesh)
Probably be gamblin' with my life if I ain't made it
Home invasions, and you ain't have to persuade me (Nah)
Cut it with a razor and serve it 'til your day
Came from whippin' out the bowl, Tom Ford suit and tie (Yeah)

I feel like Pretty Boy, Money Team out
Kissin' on the water with my chains out
My life is more effective than a cocaine drought
Cause I was trappin' at Grandma's house when I came out
I said ""Fuck the streets"" and made my own lane now
When you get high enough, you can dodge raindrops
But tell your momma and your daddy you in a gang now

They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up

[Verse 3]
She put me off and it was ugly
I made a million dollars, say she love me
The way she did me, it destroyed me
I kept it real with lil' shorty
I've been goin' bar for bar
These niggas know what's poppin' with me
I can go from car to car, these bitches quarter million at least
Two thousand for the shoes, I keep some shit on my feet
I'm prolly in the mood to fuck your bitch on the beach
I dropped out of school and I get money like Meech
Send a junkie, send a driver just to get somethin' to eat
You see how things change?
I came from cocaine

They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up

I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up a drink, say ""Fuck my problems""
The federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
I heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood hot
Heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood

I was so hardheaded at first
My grandma didn't even believe in me
I kept goin' though
All I can say is I told you
Jewelry at the bank now in the vault
You should've never doubted me
I'ma work 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah you should've never doubted me
The pain and the struggle followed me
My daddy never been there, bothered me
And these cold streets made a man of me
Know a time, it'll come, they doubt me
Had to keep them OGs 'round me
Keep a young, young homie grounded
You never know where your motivation'll come from
We do the most for these broads and pop Chandon
They try to push you aside, you gotta fight some
I had it on the dot and now we ride guns
I want that number one spot, I'm like icon
I got that beast in my eyes, I'm like Tyson
With my heart and my drive, I know I'm righteous
Keep some ice on me, Rocky, Rocky like Balboa
Once you win, win, win you gon' want more
Set a trend, trend, trend, need an encore
I was down on my last when I found myself
I'll be a fighter 'til the end, 'til my last breath

Every nigga in my gang unemployed
You fuckin' 'round, you must want a gang war
I got ol' girl, then I transport her
Trappin' is a habit, I got Xans on me
I'm hotter than a flame, keep the fan on me
Catch me whippin', I'm Hussein with them bands on me
I'ma kill the competition and I'm playin' for keeps
You see water drippin' off me then catch it
I turned nothin' into somethin', now I'm livin'
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
You didn't recognize my drive, shouldn't have did that
Now I'm flyin' every day, I won't get back
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it

Who knew I've been racin' with a whole 'nother rebel
Shawty wasn't checkin' for me, mama wasn't checkin' for me
I hustle every day just so I can spend a check on you
You my dawg 'til the end, I got so much respect for you
I watched you give up on me, but I never lost faith, did I?
You didn't ever hold me down, then I bought a new safe, didn't I?
Paper plates flushin' in that Wraith, didn't I?
I'm built with a new reputation
Blood, sweat and tears are my new foundation
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation

Then I come back to Onyx and find me that one I can fuck on
And touch on and turn up and turn on

I made me some snaps then I fucked on a genie
Put her in a cab and I jumped in a 'Ghini
You gon’ need yellow tape when I step on the scene
When you send me an invite, I come with a biznite

I'm about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take 'em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana

[Verse 1: Future]
I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I'm comin' with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud, I'm laced up to the fuckin' fo'
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, droppin' all cash (Woah)
Gutter to the death of me, I'm stickin' to the recipe
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word, fuck the roaches
Everything we do, we put Versace on the sofas
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie, I gotta stay focused

[Verse 2: Drake]
On the hood you see the Stallion, passenger a stallion
Niggas gettin' nervous, I'm passin' out the Valium
I suggest you pop it, but please don't get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerkin' up in 400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes'll see me, be like that's how you feelin'?
Used to stay up at The Twelve, now you're worth like 12 million
Boy, you did it, boy, you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fuckin' women that knew Biggie, so it really ain't no biggie
It's just OVO and XO, and Freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I'm Tony in my city, huh

Another shot of Quelo, she'll be comin' back to pesos
When you're plugged in with Pedro, it's hard for hoes to let go
See AK's ain't no bitch, nigga, I'll split your tato
Ain't nothin' about me ordinary, I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss, it's gon' take an army
The world is mine, nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin' with me, you'll move to Alaska by the mornin'
You want me to be the bad guy? Okay, it's on then
Champagne spillin', crab cakes everywhere

Ordered a pound of gas to smoke, I need a fill up (Yeah)
Got a line on good Gelato and Gorilla
Got Lil Freaky with me, know you gon' get hit up
Steppin' over dead bodies in Margielas
I touched a hundred M's and I've been gettin' better (Ooh)
In a red Bugatti, gave it right to valet
Shoot his head off right, it get you new Chanaynay
Shootin' dice all night, yeah, me and Dae Dae
We had to work the one on 'em, it was a good payday
It was a teenager, they put him on the news where I'm from
He let off forty shots, he can't get no bond
Closed on when he shoppin', when he kill him, he young
They ever get caught snitchin', they gon' cut off your tongue
I can't wait 'til they set the rat up, yeah

You know what I'm saying?

Lord, forgive me, I've been on a rampage
Grim Reaper ridin' in the Rolls Royce, yeah, yeah
Spent a day to sober up, then I popped me one up
I can't pop up when I want with her, she popular
I've been tryna fight my demons, I've been tryna fight my cup
I always tell her she my therapy, I told her it was rough
She acceptin' all my flaws, I got diamonds with the cut
I've been sufferin' withdrawals, missin' out on real love

Different, you a angel, true to me
They gon' try to convince me that it's different
But I know, it's in my spirit and I can feel it, yeah
She don't bring up when these bitches bein' miserable and typical
Take my blood, baby, we goin' digital
Thousand dollar ski boots by Perry Ellis
And I don't plan on taking no ski trip, that ink drip (Woo)
Chanel fanny pack out in Egypt, ain't no reason
Gucci bucket hat for all my heathens
Temporary distractions, ain't no grievin' 'cause they reachin'
Copy and they clone what I'm feedin', they be thievin'
China white in my home, be strategic, I gotta feed ya
Grind up on my own 'cause I see how they mistreat me
Don't you let 'em turn you on me, I see it, I can peep it
Clear like white Patron, I can see it, you conceited
Talkin' on the phone, you can hear my tone, mischievous
Plastic or the chrome, whatever we need to keep us heated
Canary yellow stone, girl, shine on my demons
I feel it in my bones when you takin' out my semen
I purchased a couple Cashmere sweaters this evening
Take you for a walk in the park like a deacon
Half a ticket, pullin' up on you and mamacita
Give you the keys in her face to show her how I treat you
I'm takin' you out on dinner dates, got Franklins like Aretha
Trained in the war zone, codeine in my one liter
Pain in my attitude, it's vicious and it's lethal
Came off the avenue and ran into a diva
Broken-hearted, baby had me down, had to get you
You out the garden, baby, I'm from the jungle with the leeches
Clouded my lungs up and I slowly started speakin'
Rain, thunderin', showin' you grace for this meetin'
Givin' you compliments throughout the day and the weekend
Fall in love with revenge, hopin' that'll kill my demons
Sittin' out on my porch, I'm in disbelief
Give me glory, give me Lori, that's victory
Moment I drop your name, is it chemistry?
Fuck this money and fame if it's meant to be
Like a rock star showin' up at a symphony
Rock hard, pissin' on my enemy
Fuck 'em all, we don't show 'em sympathy
Her favorite color blue, I bought her Tiffany
Out the trap spot, I got my dope degree
They persuaded me, they gon' try to persuade you to leave
Had laid in it, played in it, and stayed in it for weeks
Mistakes like earthquakes, they can't break us a piece
I'm not Catholic but had to have a talk with the priest
Acrobatic flips, gettin' European cash 'cross the sea
It's so radical, automatic-al, I'm knowin' we elite
Fascinated by the lifestyle, you know it bring greed
Fascinated by your vices, it's okay
Fascinated over your crisis, it's warfare
When we roll one, we converse, we like orphans
Coast to coast, float the ocean like a starfish
Check my post, I'ma toast to the heartless
That's why I'm prayin' for better days on this continent
I don't need a ghost to write my promises
You boost my confidence

Anytime we spend time, we spend more than we spend benjamins

Or asking myself questions, I had to understand…
You gotta live and learn to make mistakes to be the man

We can talk about whatever, we can fuck whenever
It’s like we’re walking on rose petals, when we together
I see you jocking me, and I’m jocking you harder
You got everything a woman want, I still want to spoil ya
And your loyalty to him ain't my concern cause you’re loyal
It's like we been casted with a spell or both ate some poison
Tell him I ain't mean to intervene with his main thing
You my main fling, I took it main stream
Everyday its nice to share our main dreams, and ain't a damn thing
Will never come between, our thing
And we ain’t mean for it to be this serious
I made a promise to you and I’ma take it serious
Cause I know my words mean the most to you
And you mean the most to me
We got a special relation, can't nobody come between

She ain't leave when I was broke
Juggin' and finessin'

Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I had to climb out the sewer
Know you looked down but I know where I'm goin'
Hold me down
Don't ruin my confidence, don't you do it
Sometimes I try to be there for you
And my plan, it don't go like I want it
Watch me roll this dope, watch me
Hit the trap and load this gun, watch me

I can see you was givin' up
And that's what killed me the most

Came out the sewer, it's stankin'
Go in the booth and I'm blankin'
Slept with my tool on the blanket
Like I'm the son of Michael
All of these haters, they're gettin' spiteful
They see my heart has been damaged
You see the whip Panoramic
You see I made it, you witnessed progression
I was talkin' like I knew I was destined
I'm a boss and I won't ever regret it
Whether you like it, you gotta admit it
That I change up your location
That I pull up in that Wraith
Have I fulfilled all your dreams?
I gave you checks
So you're checkin' it off on your wish list
You get Ferraris right now
We doin' Cali right now (without a doubt)

We goin' shoppin' right now, I see they copy right now
I see they're watchin' right now
They didn't know I was just plottin' right now
I've been executin' the play for a while
Witnessed Chubbie Baby walk down the aisle
I got a few rings on me now
Had to change my team and my style
You can't intervene on my craft
You better turn your back right now
Ain't no turnin' back right now
I can't let you cramp my style
If you ain't blink then you lookin' like an owl
Stand right back 'cause you lookin' like coward
You end up stiff, sleepin' with the flowers (ditch)

Huh, okay

Either way it go, either way it go (Either way it go, nigga, ball, ball)

So you wanna fall for the bad guy?
So you wanna fall, gettin' mad high?
Confess your love for me, testify
Anytime I'm with you, gotta testify
Anything we go through is a test of times
Can you be the one who love me all the time?
We not doing good, you can see the signs
Can you do the crime like it's Bonnie and Clyde?

I'm giving you my testimony line for line
I'm giving you the best of me, it's wrong or right
Somebody tell the kids they need to calm it down
I wanna hear your heart pump pound for pound
Show me everything I need to see on my blind side
Show me you gon' be there for the love of a real boy
I just wanna be there for my dogs, they need me
I just wanna be there for the game, that's easy
Crumble up some herb, we ain't gettin' no Z-Zs
Connoisseurs of purp, gotta give 'em a repeat
Turbo, sixty seconds in a Porsche on a one way
Amigos down in Texas, we gon' get us some grande
Cherish every minute, every second we vibe, baby
I wanna be confident when I say you my lady
I wanna be arrogant when I say you mine, baby
I know I embarrass you, I typically violate it

A lil' turbulence got you mad curious
I could've been, but I made a jugg again
Parking lot dealership, I'm in to win
We can't fake the flaws, we can't do pretend
Can you keep it solid and don't ever bend?
We gon' need colossal, we gon' need colossal
Hold me down, down, down like a real shotta
We conversin' back and forth like we real partners
Spiritually, we bonded through the turmoil
I try my best to treasure, give a little more
I know you need my time, 'cause there's gwala comin'
I know you seen the wave comin' and you start runnin'
Don't you be afraid, I'ma guard you with my life
You listen to these blogs, they gon' tell you I ain’t right
Listen to your heart and we gon' ride for life

This is an experience
If you haven't been a part of nothing this great
We went through motherfuckin', the unbelievable

[Chorus]
Hit the block and sell drugs
That's exactly how it was
Take the Sprite and take the codeine
And I pour me up a cup
Get the molly, drink of mud and smoke some bud
That's how it was
Last night we made a movie, I'ma tell you how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, bitch, how it was
How it was, nigga, how it was
How it was, I'ma tell you how it was

[Verse 1]
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it, flip it
I was self motivated, I was self driven
I got my determination, now I'm really winnin'
We could pull up Maseratis, I done whipped the Benzes
I was handin' thousands out when I go shop at Lenox
When it come to stackin' cash up, it ain't no limit
I got racks on top of racks and I ain't talking tennis
It's some girls that's gone wild, I like to see them kissin'
It's some niggas playing foul and they sneak dissin'
I won't let her hold me back to complete my mission
It ain't easy when you try to make it out the trenches

[Verse 2]
I'm the dope man, dope man, yes I am
Turned your baby mama house into a drug lab
I was using all the forks, using all the pans
She done seen a lot of money touch a nigga hands
Saw me microwaving dope, like some leftovers
Drugged in with the green grow, a lawn mower
I’m a Michael Fox, George Jetson, Elroyer
I'm a space cadet, an astronaut, a rockstar
I was trapped in the trap, dodging cop cars
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Jupiter, and Mars
You ain't foreign, it's okay, I like all broads
I'ma hustle everyday so I don't never starve

Serve it to you cleaner than the house keeper
Cruisin' by the scene with a street sweeper
Pour a half a pint of codeine in a two liter
Scorchin' hot flame, all that Future drop is heaters
I put passion in my lyrics and I'm working, nigga
Got a dogfood connect; DMX, nigga
Got a styrofoam cup, and I'm doubled up
Think I'm Usain Bolt, ran my bands up
Ain't no pressure on my money, ‘cause I'm certified
All these diamonds 'round my neck, it got em mesmerized
All these drugs inside my system got me super high
Posted up and servin' junkies, been a long time

Pray to God, take this energy
Turn around the positivity

Long as they print it, my niggas gon' get it
All of my love, I gave it to my city
All of that game you gave me, can't forget it
All that finesse you gave me, ain't forget it
I turned the whole world up, now they wanna treat me like an outcast or somethin'
These niggas so broke, instead of go and get it, they'd rather go ask for somethin'
Remember them days I had to load it up and put on my mask for somethin'
Remember we jugged for somethin'
Remember we take for somethin', yeah, yeah
I spent three stacks on these Rick Owens, I try my best to forget it
I pour my life inside these poems, my whole soul and my spirit
I'm easily agitated, get intoxicated tryna fight the demons
Tryna find right in my wrong, hope my legacy live on
Hope my legacy live on

[Verse 2]
I'm in Phipps with the sack going crazy
Got some diamonds 'round my neck, no fugazi
Bad bitches in the suite tryna bait me
Just a young hood nigga, streets raised me
Working with a unit, tryna stretch it to another one
Drinking on that Actavis, it tasting like some bubblegum
Thumbing through the check, boarding on a jet
Talking on the iPhone, sipping out the styrofoam
That dirty got my mind gone, that money got my mind blown
VVS and white stones, VVS and white stones
I'm rolling like a rolling stone
FreeBandz on Al Capone (Straight up)
And my cash way long (Turn up)
I see a bunch of clones
[Chorus]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye

[Verse 3]
Give me apartment and some water and I can swim
Got that Gambino jumping out the gym
My young nigga serving J's outside Crim
Jumping 'cross me, you know your chances slim
In my aviator Gucci like I'm driving planes
When the cash hit cash money, smell like cocaine
Doing Birdman numbers, making flips like Jackie Chan
Walk inside the jeweler, jumping bail on your ring
Spent so much on Louis, gave me free champagne
In Bal Harbour shopping and they doing the same thing
And I keep my cup with me like a pimp
I think I'm Magic Don Juan, take a glimpse
Spike Lee need to get this shit on film (Movie!)
Future (Ask, yeah, yeah)
[Chorus]
I wear Gucci, I wear Bally at the same damn time
On the phone, cooking dope, at the same damn time
Selling white, selling mid, at the same damn time
Fucking two bad bitches at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
I'm on Pluto, I'm on Mars at the same damn time
On the sofa, popping bottles, at the same damn time, aye11Embed"

I could tell you was into me from our instant chemistry
As I reflect memory, you ride or you die for me
I'll go to war over you want, I dont give a fuck by showing you
You know what it is shawty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in Benjamins, you shop with no limited
You reminisce every session, know you’ll come back again
I know you can’t breath without me, you gon' need your oxygen
I damn near gave you a overdose on my own medicine
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what’d it be is it heaven sent
Let’s put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us

Run in my direction and don’t you run from me

After you get money and all your dreams come true
It's like everything that surround you get brand new
I can't never forget the struggle and I pay dues
Can't let the money and fame come between my crew
My pain still runnin' deeper than the ocean

Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
Bitch, you better cut it, shawty, I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh, you greedy in Tahiti, I can seen your flaw
Ayy, tell that girl you 'bout to sell the work 'cause you tired of it
And see how she react when you're no longer in your Bimmer
Then she find out that the Bentley wasn't really rented
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo?
Oh, you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio?
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from making mula
Oh, you gold-diggin', diggin', graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda (Hey)
Let's have a heart-to-heart, drink wine, make art (Whoa-oh)
Backseat of the Benzo, the AMG (Ayy)
Can you love a thug, is all make-believe

From my lips, 'cause if I'm broke, it's only -hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up, and if I were, why?
Would you throw a party? (Can't have it)
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
Correction: These hoes don't mean it when fallin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
Stop searchin' for words, I feel stupid, man
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care
White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zipping through the city and I'on't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me
Why would I do that to her?
Simple-ism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
'Cause if I buy one, they gon' sell ten, and what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk (Hey)
'Til then, I will ride my fuckin' bike, or walk—ehh

Say she the realest bitch I ever met, then show me some proof

She don't wanna stand in my line, she tryna come to the front
Yeah-uh, she love her country but hate American cars
For the shape of them, he'll have you know all of them bitches is foreign
If yellow seems to be the color in fashion
What happens to all of this good Black pussy he keep ignoring?
The world told him didn't shit rhyme with ""orange""
The girl is only with him because he's touring
Well, go on, angel, I don't blame you, don't hang yo head

Grew up three minutes from downtown, shit get way too real

I got your ex tryna call, shit gettin' way too real
You know I'm with the shits, shit get way too real

And I ain't never been to the Republics
On a long ass flight, can't get no sleep
Broke ass nigga can't talk to me
That's the reason why I put diamonds in my teeth
I get money for so long that I'm countin' this paper in my dream
Everything I get turn to brûlée
So your bitch pull up 'til I make her cream
And you know I do this shit just for myself
But you know I do this shit just for my team

I can make her dreams come true, yeah
Baby, that don't mean I blew off her roofs
I drip drip, made the pussy get loose
Might be in a Tom panini suits
And she got Cha-nay-nay on her too
When I'm in Tom Ford and I'm in the strip club
Can't let the cheap pussy get too close
I just spent twenty thousand dollars on my outfit
And I had a bitch pullin' up in the Ghost
Niggas see the wrist when it flick and it's froze
If I hang up, don't call back at all
Switched up lens and I switched my broad
I'll never switch up on my dawgs
I can tell the real from the fake and the fraud
One-three-hundo sit in the garage
Rather tell the truth, but I know it's gon' hurt
Had to put a little bitty bitch on a shirt, for sure-ski
[Chorus: Future]
I won't never call back, if I hang up, I mean it, yeah (For sure-ski)

Fuck a bitch in a big way

And we ain't gotta talk about it, you can tell we rich
Everything we went through, man, I can never forget

By the time I was seven, my Uncle Wayne was in prison
We used to take a trip once a month and go visit
My Grandma and my Granddad, yeah, they all suspicious
Just say no to drugs, hell nah I ain't listen
And loyalty is everything, I'll never forget it
I keep my gun everywhere I go, I'll never forget it
""And why your Sprite so pink?"" I got Promethazine in it
""Why you drive your car nervous?"" I got dope all in it (Let's go)
I custom made a cross from the money I made (Money I made)

You can tell I act the same 'cause I acknowledge the bitch
I'm drankin' on my lean, I swear to God I would quit
My auntie was a fiend, I used to serve her a hit
I'm thankin' God today that she don't smoke it no more
I made so much fuckin' money, I put a safe in the floor
We got traps in every hood, I used to serve out the stove
I still own the chopper and the old .44
Stick 'em up, hit 'em up, get it and go
We got bags full of cash that we ready to blow
Hittin' licks every day, nigga go sell dope
Them Jewish lawyers and accountants, that's the life that I know

To my foreign bitches, tell me if I’m too persistent (Foreign, foreign)
All my baby mamas, I just bought ‘em brand new Benzes

Extravagant Hendrix
Switch hands like left pitcher
Super astronomical

[Chorus]
Peel you off a couple bands, girl like, ""here you go""
Been lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white Rolls
We livin' marvelous, yeah we livin' marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' them that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, nah

[Verse 1]
Three rings on my left, I feel like King James
They see the way we represent, they see the way we get it
You can't be never slippin', you gotta show you're different
I came through and took all their bitches with me!
Nigga I get all the way faded, I can't get tipsy
All these seven star restaurants on a daily basis? I'm guilty
Let this champagne start pourin', drank it up 'til it's empty
Got this V.I.P. section burnin' like a chimney
We ain't gotta emphasize nobody, we done bought the building
Let's go zip out Australia, we can go to Switzerland
We got a chauffeur and a translator for where they don't speak English
Sometimes when you speak from your soul it sound like you singing
[Chorus]
Peel you off a couple bands, girl like, ""here you go""
Been lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes
White Phantom, white Phantom or the white Rolls
We livin' marvelous, yeah we livin' marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' them that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I need to stop it
Keep it real, you lookin' exotic, nah

[Verse 2]
Gotta put a whole lot of kush into my lungs
I put a whole lot of work in, I just begun
And when that green money on the turf, it's their call
Gotta put that steel under my shirt and duck laws
Fuck the cops, she gon' ride just like my dog
Chinchilla, I put it on and let it fall
Gorilla, let it drag on the floor
I forgot to get the money and lay low
We take shoppin' sprees, I can bring the store to me
I don't get trap money, please, bitch I'm out their league
Raf Simons, Rick Owens, cost 200 G's
Cash out mad G's, bustin' down AP's
Handmade 1 of 1 Riccardo Tisci
Crystal diamonds on my sleeves, L-O-V-E
Changed the whips about a week, yes I do agree
Louis V on my carry-on, yes indeed
Have to pay for it tonight as you charge a fee
Order the PJ at 1, we land tomorrow at 3
Steak and shrimps, caviar for seven days
Let's flick it up for my dawgs in the cage
[Chorus]
Peel you off a couple bands, girl like, ""here you go""
Been lookin' like the baddest bitch in my videos
I wanna take you out to Paris and buy you better clothes

We livin' marvelous, yeah we livin' marvelous
Hit your girl up and tell' them that you're all iced up (iced up)
I try my best to put my ego first, I need to stop it

Yeah, I told 'em
I told 'em if it's a problem, say it's a problem
I told you off the top that I was solid
I told you we get money by the pillow
I told you half of these niggas with me win now

[Chorus]
My left and right hand Robert Horry
Most my niggas pop Xans unemployed
I can't stop, I'm goin' in, steroids
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
I'm washin' off my hands with the mula like it's Ajax
Sippin' out my cup, hell no, don't you taste that
Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them

[Verse 1]
20 different strippers, money double, triple
Started off slizzered, they callin' me The Wizard
Valet got that Porsche, Casino got that Porsche
Killers all I know, fill 'em up with the dough
You know I'm on that syrup, about to send the word
Do niggas really argue? Who gon' shoot you first
Fatface wanna do you, Blade wanna do you
This bitch from Guyana, layin' low with that hammer
Try not to fuck her on camera
I pray that my young nigga don't kill you on camera
You come too close, nigga, I'ma have to kill you on camera
I hate to discuss it
If Bubba don't trust you, nigga, you know I don't trust you

[Verse 2]
Heater on your side, it's a hundred percent chance
Some of these people by my side is straight up out the can
We come from the bottom, upper echelon
I came here to serve you, need some cash on delivery
I just hope she washed her mouth out before you kiss her
My downtown bitch said, ""Did you heard me?""
I think she stays five minutes from Bourbon
I had an Arizona plug, used to serve me
I throwed that money in the bag cause it was dirty
He got that chopper on him now and he hurtin'
I know he 'bout to let it go and that's for certain
I know he 'bout to let it go and that's for sure
