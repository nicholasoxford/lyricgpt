We be throwin' money in a spiral
Every time your girl hear my song, yeah, turn her right into my ho
She shake her ass (I'm working on dying), do the eye roll
Got a skinny thong like a tightrope
I be blowin' up like some pyro
Coupe 150, call it Kyro

[Verse 1]
If she left with me, she the right ho
Man, she ridin' me like a BMX
Man, she said the D is for Dyno
I got two horns like a rhino
It's no way you could buy ho
But I bought a mansion with a slide door
Yes, I opened up the slide door
So you can hear her hit the high note

I like the way you (Ayy)
You do it (Ayy)

Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Money keep comin' in, I can't lose
Foreign girls and they 10s, I can't choose
Foreign car got V10, I can't cruise
[Chorus]
I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind
Drop the top on the Wraith, I'ma make it lose its mind
I just made 100K, it was quicker than a Vine
I was swingin' from a vine, tryna pull me down but I climb
I'ma get it, keep tryin', there's no reason for the cryin'
We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be ridin' and my doors suicide

[Verse 2]
Side note, you will never reach my goals (At all)
I be walkin' with a slime nose
And I'm also walkin' with my side ho
Only time I be walkin' when I'm on the moon, so I feel like Michael
I was talkin' to my little slime, that's a lil' lizard, call her Geico
In reality, I'm 5'4""
Stand on my money, now I'm 6'6""
Hit her once, now she dismissed
Can't fuck her sister, make her lick dick
Forty-orty make my hip thick
When I see an opp, make the clip hit
Aimin' at his top, boy you need a mop
Man, I'm goin' out with a vengeance
My pants, Raf Simons
My shoes, Rick-Rick
Your girl dipped my tartar sauce so she ate my dick like a fish stick
Hit it raw, yes, I am a dog, I don't do this shit for no image
All my diamonds, they be hittin' hard
Try to play me boy, that's a scrimmage

I got different color on my diamonds, I can't even see the time
I don't wanna see her face, I'ma go and get behind

We the ones that be slidin', they the ones that be dyin'
Know my boys, they be riding and my doors suicide

[Verse 3]
Live it up, you can just go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Got frost on my diamonds, I'm gettin' the cake now
Now stay on your stomach, lil' bitch, when you lay down
Live it up, 'cause you can go any day now
Mykko Montana, this beat is from K Camp
Frost on my diamonds 'cause I got the cake now
When you on your stomach, lil' bitch, better lay down
I'm so up and I can't turn it down
They counted me out, my whole life turned around
Clean up my diamonds, you know I got rinse it
Know my boys comin', you know they mean business
That advance that you waitin' for, already spent it
When I’m on the beat man, you know I'm gon' kill it

Purple thoughts in my brain, hope it don't spill
Stay with a nerd just like Urkel, Jaleel
Fresh just like Carlton, I kill ’em with Will
Big ass ""R"" on my Smiths
Big ass ""R"" on my whips
Slip-on shoes, so you won't trip
Said she kinda fine if she got some hips

Mix it up, boy, bad luck""

I could never change, gotta stick to my routine
I'ma hit it once, then you know I gotta leave
Got addictive personality, I turned into a fiend
Okay, my money sky blue, but my new coupe is slime green
My boys whip work 'til the white turn all tan (Tan)
Saw a minivan followin' my brand new Lamb' (Lamb')
I had a F and an N in my hand (And an N)

Okay, okay, nigga, let's get it
Got your bitch on my top just like a fitted (Let's get it)

Balmain jeans, on the front got the zipper
My ice game got cold, got sicker
I'm a Leo like lion, I'm Simba
Stand on my money, I'm tall like a center
June and July cold just like December
It's too low, then the car, I lift it
I know baby girl miss my drip, yeah
Girl, your breath stink, need a spearmint, many (Yeah)
You need to go and take a minute
But your ass fat, lemme go for the finish

Four years, I ain't touch no chick
[Chorus]
Whip back-to-back, back-to-back, back-to-back (Yeah)

Yes, that's them racks, that's them racks, that's them racks (Racks, racks)
Your jeans, they too fat, man, them shits, they relaxed
I got on Dior, and my skinnies, they all black
If we serve the sack, then we take that shit right back (Back, back)
650 for a hat, 6666 hundred for a jacket
Tried to hold me tight, but I didn't hug her back (No way)
'Cause she tried to snatch out my pocket with the racks (These racks)

[Chorus]
Fuck from the back, hit her once, that's a wrap (Let's go)

Pastry, pocket, boy, you not havin' cake
Fuck that overcoat and I swear your jacket late
Bro just made his money back off a half a plate
Rollie cost me forty thousand, that's half the face
I remember when them niggas all laughed at me
Portfolios, now they all bring they apps to me
Wish before me that my bitch practiced abstinence
Wishes don't come true until you just practice it
Niggas broke? Never, ho, bitch, we havin' it
Yes, we spendin' it, but you know we stackin' it (Let's go)
[Verse 2]
I was steppin' on the beat, took a nap on it

She said, ""Baby, you know your dad a panther?""

Kill a opp, now my boys gonna hibernate
Sike, nah, they back on it the next day
The reason he died 'cause that boy gon' hesitate
Nigga, you started this shit, I'm just, ""Let's play""
She suck on my dick 'til that bitch gon' regurgitate
She tellin' you that she never even heard of me
I can't trust none of these niggas, might turn on me
I'm still a millionaire, this shit not hurtin' me (Woah)
But it's hurtin' you (Yeah)
And I know the truth
I still watch Big Bang Theory, that's the nerd in me
I remember when your ass was just swervin' me
Please keep that same energy with the urgency
I'm liftin' these big ol' stacks like my name Hercules
Bulletproof on my tank, that's my insurgency
These old niggas wanna rob me like a burglary (Let's go)

Grandma don't like diamonds, she say ""Make sure that my rent's paid,"" yeah
And I make sure that your rent's paid
Make you live your own life when you hung out with Lindsay
I don't want you never ever running in a frenzy
But that's just some shit that everybody friends say

I don't know what's next, yeah (Yeah)
I don't want my ex, no (I don't want her back)

Walkin' with a check (With a check)
Take off in a jet (I don't want my ex)
So I just never stress

Stuff a hundred rounds in the compact, contact
I probably fucked the bitch from your hometown projects
Opened up her mouth, put my dick all inside that
She don't get high, but she geeked off the contact
That's why I'll never, ever, ever keep in contact (Yeah)
Just closed case, so a nigga can't find that, baby, where your mind at?
Come here, girl, sign that, matter fact, oh, never mind then
Front door, find that after the climax
And she screamin' my name every time we behind it
When I heard the door, get up, baby, where my nine at?
Water on my neck, 3D like it's IMAX (Water)
Diamonds turned a bird to a goddamn blind bat
Ass so fat that I got to hit beside that
Heard a nigga put his Lamb' trucks on finance (Finance)
Woah (No, no, no), y'all niggas insane
No, we're not the same, I'm more like a big body (Skrrt), you like a Range
These niggas, they frauds, they repping my gang (Vroom)
Like, what's up with that? (No, for real)
I just pulled up Maybach, yeah, and that shit all matte black, yeah
[Chorus]
I got one girl from Philly, I think her name Nicki
And I fuck with Nicki 'cause she not too picky
And she not too choosy, but sometimes she bougie
I play with her kitty until it get sticky
I'm movin' the bitch just like an alien
Chop with a fifty, my Uzi Israeli
See, I turned to the boss, can't deal with no middleman
Anthony Davis, don't deal with the Pelicans (What?)
Straight out the mud, we got that work that turn you to the Grudge
Leave you slime like a snail, you get hit with these slugs
I say how I feel and I do what I want
And not just because it is what it was
I'm high like a bird, man, but don't got no Lugz
Know you heard what I said, got this shit out the mud

Forty-five-hundred for some Margiela kick-offs
Got the yellow diamond Patek on my wrist, too pissed off
Laughin' to the bank, it's funny (Ha-ha)
Go get you some, go get your own money
Hold on, I got you with some loan money
No, matter fact, you ain't help me when I had no money
Three-hundred thousand, yeah, that's your money
Twenty more million, that's tour money
If you fuck me good, that's your money (Woah)

Why my neck so frozen? Why my Rollie golden?
Walking with my .40, and my money showing
Walking with that stunned AP, my money ain't foldin
Boy, I am not slow, you hate on the low
You was still at home, I was on the road

Dior my cologne, smoking gas it's strong
Leave me alone, stop calling my phone
Already know what you're thinking lil baby, girl, oh what up though?
She said ""Uzi baby, they ain't got no dough""
Why you're so dope? Yeah, you oughtta know

I get money, fuck your bitch, stay real, ooh, that's three facts
Diamonds on my fist, my wrist, my grill, ooh, I mean that
Made your girl swallow my dick like a pill, ooh, don't relapse
She keeps stalking on my phone, think this thing's tapped
Diamonds all up on my pinky, think this thing's tap

Woah, money envelope

Like 808s & Heartbreak, Kanye with a little hentai
Samurai Jack on a journey, on my lonely, always rockin' Vetements
They asked me can I rap, man, can I?
But I chose to be a sharp shooter like Chris Benoit
Drivin' in that Lamb', I remember when my mom took me to PennDOT
Fucked a girl from Sweden then I sent her ass to Denmark
Fucked a girl from LA and I left her ass right there
Of course you rock with me 'cause I just came out this year (Yeah)
But I'ma see if you really fuck with me if you listening next year (Yeah)

Why is yo bitches so ugly?
My bitch so perfect, she kinda look Asian (Yeah)
Come all the way from Toronto
All she do is sucky-sucky
My stomach problem from all of this muddy
No money problems ‘cause I’m gettin’ money (Money)
This shit is crazy, it just started for me
I was just home, broke, doin’ the dougie
Pinky ring, water-flooded
Wrist got cold yellow diamond runnin’
Grab a tissue if it is an issue (Damn)
Used to grab a pistol
No, I didn’t for them itty-bitty niggas
I’m from the city with real killers
Nigga Gilly said, “Ya’ gon’ win now”
Uzi countin’ all these major figures
Getting money, got a major hitter
But I ain’t talkin’ Barry Bonds (Yeah)
When I was younger, wanted Keri Hilson
Nigga like Dennis the Menace
Now my money old like Mr. Wilson (Yeah)
Sneak dissing, who you? The records be missing
I fuck with Hit-Boy, I’m tryna be a hitman
Takin’ yo ass straight out of existence
Where is yo hitman? The other man got him
Shout out Jodye Flacko, fuck wit’ your album
Moving them pigeons, them birds, they be flockin’

When I get rough, she crank that like a cock-shift
She shake her ass on my dick like a cocktail
I could’ve fucked your bitch right in L.A
SLS, she play with my Cartier case
I had put some money right in the safe
Didn’t do nothin’, was high, it was late
But we still talk on the phone everyday
About, goin' on that perfect date
She hear my name, pussy on percolate
Only date is my dick all in her face (Woo)
Wait, .45, that’s all on my waist (That bitch is all on my waist)
Wait, why these niggas in the way?
Why do these niggas be frontin’
They just be there with no office
Most of their parents be owning they office
That both of my parents pray more than less often (Yeah)
My old bitch always be gaggin’ and coughin’
My new bitch, she swallow me up so jawless
I want the money, the fame, and the Barbie
You know, the white bitch that look like iCarly
She ride my dick like that bitch is a Harley (Skrrt, skrrt)
I just got Energy jewels that was counterfeit (Counterfeit)
Clock rounds like my VVS diamond wrist
Everything real, so keep on watchin' it (Watchin' it)
If you watchin' me, then you watchin' it (You watchin' it)
My new bitch I swear is a prophetess
Gettin' money really ain't no option, bitch (No option)
Went to Maury and the lie detector said (Oh)
Boy, I swear you did not write the script (Oh)
Never really was a fan, though
Four-door coupe, open just like a sandal
We used to pray for them Lambos
I take my girl to a private resort
Heard we walk 'round wearin' sandals
My bitch so bad, she a handful
That's why she treat me so good
Wake up the pussy and eggs, they be scrambled
