D.A.
Hah

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Slide on it pimp game with my pinky ring
Lotta gang, lotta bitches, and a icy chain
Why you claim that you rich? That's a false claim
I be straight to the whip, no baggage claim
Whole lotta styles, can't even pronounce the name
You ain't got no style, see you on my Instagram
I be rockin' it like it's fresh out the pan
Only when I'm takin' pics, I'm the middleman
Walk, talk it like a boss, I just lift a hand
Three million cash, call me Rain Man
Money like a shower, that's my rain dance
And we all in black, like it's Gangland
Say the wrong words, you be hangman
Watch me stick to your bitch like a spray tan
Aw, Mr. What-Kind-of-Car-He-In?
And the city love my name, nigga, I ain't gotta say it

[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same like Mary-Kate
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste
(Taste, taste), do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me
[Verse 2: Tyga]
Lotta girls like me, niggas wanna fight me
Nigga, get your ass checked like a fuckin' Nike
Me not icy, that's unlikely
And she gon' suck me like a fuckin' Hi-C
Aw, chains on the neck for the whole team
And I feel like Gucci with the ice cream
And my bitch want the Fenty, not the Maybelline
I'm the black JB, the way these bitches scream
Make these bitches scream
Ah, pretty little thing
Like my nigga A.E.
Say, ""Yadadadamean""

[Chorus: Tyga & Offset]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), fuck what a nigga say
It's all the same like Mary-Kate
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste
(Yes, yes), do you love the taste?
Yeah, that's cool (Offset)

[Verse 3: Offset]
Yeah, I'ma put the drip on the plate, yeah (Drip, drip)
Diamond ice glacier, niggas imitate (Ice, ice)
Ayy, ayy, feed me grapes, Maybach with the drake (Grapes)
Slow pace in the Wraith, got this shit from bae (Skrrt)
Diamonds up to par (Par), the cookie hittin' hard (Hard)
The 'Rari sit in park (Park), on Addy on Mars (Mars)
Shotgun shells, we gon' always hit the target (Blah)
Popcorn, big shell poppin' out the cartridge (Pop it)
3400 Nawfside, Charles Barkley (Nawf)

Make her get on top of me and ride me like a Harley (Ride)
She wanna keep me company and never wan' depart me, depart me (No)
Yeah, fishtail in the parking lot (Skrrt, skrrt)
I don't kick it with these niggas 'cause they talk about ya (Yeah)
Yeah, and I got the fire, don't make me spark it out ya (Fire)
Yeah, keep it in my back pocket like it's a wallet (Who?)
Like the way she suck it, suck it like a Jolly (Woah)
Stack it up and put it with the whole project (Racks)
And she got that Patek on water moccasin (Patek)
I'm rich in real life, I get that profit, copy (Hey)
[Chorus: Tyga]
(Taste, taste), she can get a taste
(Taste, taste), let you get a taste

Yeah, that's cool, but he ain't like me

Fuck what they talkin' 'bout
All a nigga hear is my chains clinkin' back and forth right now, nigga
Yeah, fuck with me

[Chorus]
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration?
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'
I'm puttin' in, I'm penetratin'
I'm gettin' big, I'm stimulated
I touched a bitch, she disintegrated
Up in flames, I've been the flamest
I've been the hottest, you've been the lamest
I've been on the plane, you've been complainin'
Fuck the co-defendant, pistol whip the plaintiff
Hit the mall, then we skip arraignment
They say she young, I should've waited
She a big girl, dog when she stimulated

[Verse]
Hit Sin City and syndicate it
All the time on the strip in Vegas
I got the juice but I ain't Minute Maid it
But a nigga made it just minutes later
Shut the fuck and let me finish, baby
I'll let you finish later
Why the fuck you so opinionated?
Yeah you book smart but don't be gettin' paper, uh!
Shootin' craps at The Wynn
Gettin' back to back wins
Made 20 bands playin' features
And I don't need a feature for this
Nigga I'm T-R-A, triple double
Every time I ball, man that's triple double
Tom Ford, Balmain, that's triple stuntin'
Tryna get a nut only gets you nothin'
So I don't give a fuck who these niggas datin'
Tsunami the Rollie, my wrist is flooded
How the fuck can these niggas hate it
When these bitches love it, man this shit is funny
All I can do is laugh, all I can do is laugh
They try to count me out, all day I'm doin' math
All I can do is add, multiply, multiply
All day I'm doin' math, but we won't divide
You ain't got the flow, you ain't got the heart
You be on your mark but you're never ready
You just talkin' shit, I can smell your breath
Sayin' what you do, but can't help yourself
[Chorus]
So why the fuck you so opinionated?
Sayin' how you do it but they ain't did it, baby
You need a demonstration?
This is how you get richer, baby
I'm stimulated
I'm at the bank, I'm penetratin'

Got champagne and we pourin' it
She poppin' it and she snortin' it
My iPhone recordin' it, if I want it, I can afford it
Bitch I'm Young Khalifa, fillin' my lungs with reefer
Somewhere in the clouds, gotta press up to see us
I gotta whip so fast that I caught a ticket speedin'
And my bitch so bad that I'm never ever cheatin'
I might pull up in some shit that you've never ever seen
And if I said how much I made, then you won't even believe it
Me and T-Y gettin' gnarly when we pull up to the party
Brought a whole pound of Mary

She hopped on the blunt, say, where the hookah y'all?
I tell her pass back if the shit too strong, it's all set

Lookin' at your future, baby, put down the cigarette
Come hop on this kush jet and take flight, yeah

And when I said I love you, yeah I fuckin’ meant it
And we ain’t gotta bring your moms and your sister in it
House too big, they all trying to spend the night
You always inviting them and I don’t even be liking it
At all, and I don’t even say shit
‘Cause I just like to see you happy even when you faking it
So flagrant you foul ass bitch, man I hate you
I hope we can make up in the A.M
[Hook]
‘Cause the days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea

[Verse 2 – Tyga]
Uhh, for every last king need a queen
If you love me now then forever hold this ring
Hold me down, defend it; hold me down, no witness
You always got so much pride but once you look in my eyes
It’s over, you even told me about you when you was younger
How your father abused you, I let you cry on my shoulder
No tissue, just short sleeve, tears see-through
Our lives equal, thinking what you been through
Uhh, yo Genie here
Yea I grant you every wish
Put you in environments, good company success
Already set, you going with the best
I know I lied before but trust me I ain’t like your ex
Sex so good, break up then break a sweat
We should stay together, then we fight again
Same old shit, different location
Feeling like my time wasted
[Hook]
‘Cause the days go by, we argue all the time
I want to make it right, ‘cause that was last night
Baby we gon be alright, baby we gon be alright
Yea yea love was the mark, bullets to your heart
I want to move on but my feelings too strong
I don’t wanna waste time, I don’t wanna waste time
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea
It’s like we’re in a love game, love game
Love game, love game
Yea, yea, yea, yea

[Verse 3 – Tyga]
Trying to forget someone that you love
Like trying to remember someone that you never knew
Think about it, I dream about it
My nightmares haunting me, I can’t sleep about it
Anxiety, can’t breathe, can’t live without you
The revival, all these verses is my survival
Standing at the podium, waiting on your arrival
One day but no return
Like Usher say, gotta let it burn

[Outro – Tyga]
The hardest part of dreaming about someone you love
Is waking up to see that person gone
You know it, it it takes seconds to say hello
But forever to say goodbye
Moving on is easy, but what you leave behind
Is what makes it hard…26Embed"

Still pop ace king shit I'm with Rozay
Black Maybach leather gloves on that OJ
OK the day you beating me bitch no day
Bandz a make her dance that's thousand dollar foreplay
AK get a full clip not a soundwave
You kissed her in her mouth, ask her how my dick taste
Bitch nigga you don't want no drama, I'm worth a couple commas
It's death before dishonor
Last King come sign up, all my shit be designer
Extroardinary rhymer I bodied yo' shit for nothin'

Get wet up she give me head not neck up

H on the Buckle, Hermes and the hustle
Crown on the watch, young niggas still thuggin'

Went gold in a month so it ain't no budget
New chains, rolex links
New chick just to drag my mink
New car just to ride 'round here
Aviator crew we flyest 'round here
Hating on hood niggas dying 'round here
Bath Salt Boss, got insurance on the beard
Cars rockstars, dope boys at odds
I done seen it all but it's back to these broads
Hands clap like a nigga in the stadium
Million dollar chain but I'm rocking 8 of 'em
I see you slipping boy don't make me pick your label up
Scottie Pippen on the dribble I just laid 'em up
Another triple got me tripping like it's angel dust
We just winning all the women in my table ah
Say my name say my name nigga say my name
Hundred million dollar nigga, nigga say my name

And I know I made mistakes and you forgave me how (how)
I don't understand, you know I'm trying the best I can (can)
I guess it's consequences when you dealing with sin (sin)
And even sacrificed your friends over me
All them nights in the club turn to nights with me
It's like the same old story out your diary (diary)
Memories never fade but only in time we'll see (see)
Hope to see you with me 'cause...

My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up
But my heart beats for you, baby, I’ma go and scream it loud
But if you leave, it's something I can't control
So let's do it one last time and fuck for the road

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, grippin' and biting
Remember the times after fighting
You said you loved me, I liked it
Became obsessed with the sexing
You screaming, “Whose is it?” we naked
Now I'm pullin' your hair told you take it
A couple of shots, now we faded
Don't even know we made it, we home
Got that look in your eyes like hope you mine
Said you hoped the feeling’s real, really tired of all the lies
One minute we fine, then we not, everything I do you can't
But that's no reason for making mistakes, this time put it all on the plate
I, I told you be loyal, spoil you, never disown you
You get lonely when I'm touring, just hold it down ,be supportive
I'll be back in the morning, that new purse you wanted
What's good if you can't flaunt it (flaunt it), show it
Ain't the same, better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to make, make you understand, make you understand that

My heart beats for you, girl, you know are the one (oh, for you)
Why you mad at me? Girl, I know I made mistakes, I know I fucked up (oh, made mistakes, I know I fucked up)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
All I ever wanted was your happiness
But right now let's get right down to it, let's handle this business
If you gonna leave me tonight, I gotta kiss it goodbye
Girl, I'm 'bout to make it cry, and all I need is one more time 'cause my...

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Last time, best time, better than my next time
Rolex and vest time, Moët it's sex time
Hard to let go, a part of you gon’ be alone
Scrolling your phone, looking at texts, seems like not too long ago
Ain't the same better than the rest (rest)
And what's real love if you ain't got respect? (Got respect)
And it's no way I can pay you back (back)

Know some Hoover niggas that's down to ride
For a homicide, when its drama time
Niggas thinkin' that they MCs
Can't get touched, well its hammer time
Who the fuck is Lil Durk?
I dust you like ash and purp
Your flow wack, my flow crack
Got marble floors, your floors crack
Got rap shit, mice traps
These niggas broke, need ankle wraps
Don't ride around in LA, if you ain't come on the jet with the strap
My niggas 52 Orange roofs, orange coupes, Ciroc orange juice
Trel said fuck all you, my OG Chimp out soon
H rat, shout out ScHoolboy Q, still my dog
You're a real one, I owe you
Shot at them niggas when you heard the news
If your daughter ever need something, don't hesitate I got you
Posted up on sunset at the House Of Blues like it's all cool
Might get trapped in Vegas too, call Mally Mall he with Big U
I might be in Bel Air, still got niggas in the field
20 million, LK real
With Yeezus in that SLR, T Raw upper echelon
No Lil Jets just G5's
Free CB, H Rat, Lil Punch and baby Nitty
My Maybach cost 2 chickens, you ain't got one? Don't talk my language
I’m king shitting on yo bitch
Southpaw and we in the gym
Tryna be a baller? End up like Flip in ""Above The Rim""
You too small like Smeagol
I’m swatting the mosquito
I’ll put you under the earth now it’s a garden on your tombstone
You shit stain teenagers, barely teething on hundos
I'll hold you like the slave you are, all my whips mayo
You from Illinois? I'll bring the noise
You ain't platinum? Don’t talk to me. Grammy nominated? Don't talk to me
20 Million? Don’t talk to me
It's levels to this shit boy, you basement? Don't talk to me
You want the fame? I'll take your name and that weak bitch you fall asleep with!

Ain't got no time for this rap shit, Blood Money, Cash Money

Yo Trel let a nigga hit him with a ratchet
Big U let a nigga get some matches
I'ma torch the building this La Familia
Pull up and spin a nigga backwards
Light it up, smoke a nigga like a Backwood

All of the moments we had, beginning and just the end

Damn, now I'm driving Ferrarris, fucking random bitches
People saying I made it but I don't feel too different
Wayne told me, ""Close your eyes, they'll never see your vision""
So I stay ready to die behind these Biggie lenses

Just left the hood, word to the 5th Dist
Bout to cop a G, tear the roof like Diddy
And my city color purple nigga, no Celie

Bitches stand on their feet, handicapped, get out your seat
Got that buzz, Lil B, sting a bitch, Ali
Hah! Comparing tighter rappers, but my songs greater
Just compare me to dope dealers and ballplayers
Cause I'm a dope ass nigga and I ball, player

Uh, bitches pecking my wood: wood chucka chucka
Never gave two fucks: double rubbers
Now your color turn your face to a red gusher
And your girl stick it to me like a car bumper
Never depended on anyone co-dependent
Kept my thoughts to myself, I don't need opinions
No middle mans, in the middle of my sands
Niggas think they sweet, they can't even pay their incidentals
I'm detrimental, on any instrumental
I ain't pulling teeth, nigga better hide your pillow
Chew these rappers to the fucking gristle
Bad to the bone, red zippers, Mike Jizzle, nigga gone

Always got the paycheck, never took a pay cut
Payday will be worth all the broke nights I stayed up
So in my cup, I'm mixing up whatever dreams are made of
Not too many young G's made it where I am
So I was waiting on a doctor man, patient as I am
I guess a young D-boy made it into a man
With girls half-naked around like we finna land in the sand
Red-eyes to Rome and they connecting to France
With some bomb-ass pussy, that bitch came straight from Iran
My jewelry made in Japan, I'm off California drugs
And where I made my money, huh? Nigga, all of the above
I could count my inner circle on my hands and my feet
Passing joints long as a branch cause it's family tree
Doing kush-ups man cause the weed too strong

Her flexing ass, let me see you flex that ass
I don't call I just text that ass and buy special bags
Python, all gold no ice on
Nothing but shaved pussy in my iPhone
And this right here a no fly zone
And you are not us, so don't try, holm'
I buy cars, I buy homes, my antidote for my catapult
I'm up through there, foreign shoes, these a new pair

Aye, nigga, what that work like?
Aye, bitch, what that work like?
You know me I've been trappin' with it all night
Niggas wanna take it there, we can take it there, all night

[Verse 1]
Aye nigga, Raww with the drama
I'll bring it to your face, cook it like Benihana's
Then ride out on Yokohamas
And my fingernails dirty, I've been countin' straight 100's
Why these niggas wanna test me on the low though?
Got no mothafuckin' patience so I'm patient with the scope though
Put your potty mouth on the low
Sleepin' with the enemy, It's like hangin' on a rope
Jim Carrey, I ain't fuckin' with you liars
All black attire, if we match it fuel the fire
This time man we aimin' for the body
I'm puttin' X's on the wall, if you resurrect, you Makaveli
Sphinx, I'm a pharaoh, ain't a fairy
Potato on the barrel, watch your soul fly like a sparrow
All my niggas thorough about dinero
Nigga never was my homie, all these bitches know you're corny nigga

'Bout your money, you've been trappin' with it all night
Bitches wanna take it there, you gon' take it there all night

[Verse 2]
I make that money reappear
Hoppin' off the Lear, ain't no passengers in here
I got D'usse poppin', no beer
Why you in my ear? I can't hear the money clear
When I'm back in the city and it's clear
My name in the sky with the lights on the field
I'm a gold chain buyin' pioneer
Got that ricky in the trunk and I pop it if a nigga near
Papa's got a brand new bag, baby, Goyard
Cash, baby, Maybach rag, baby, yeah, baby
LK frames on the dash, smashin' the fast lane
With a baddy, mane, ass, got a fatty, mane
Tattoos, Vera Wang, G5, hydroplane
Last Kings, everything (everything?) everything
Cartier love rings, but this ain't no love thing
Married to them green things, Franklins and money trees

Hit you like a bully bitch, yeah saved by the bell
If you scared, go to church I’ll see you in hell
And your girl, she a flip, give me heads or tails
Everybody fake so I got real for sale
Gunpowder fill the air
Rappers shittin’ on theyself, you could smell the fear
And these bitches laying flowers cause the king is near
T-Raw this is the new flavour in ya ear
Niggas softer than baby hair
Why you acting tough, heard you work at Build-A-Bear
I’m a dealer all my girls come in deuce and pairs
I’m in the building I construct so crank this muthaf-cker up
What the funk you beezy’s want
I’m ready to hump the car I call it ele-phunk
Trunk in the front
Man she give me good brain till she feel dumb
I just keep going like the bunny till I feel numb
Yeah these bitches want it
I put my man’s on it
That 110 Sup’, and that Ferrari California
Niggas want beef, call me Tony Roma
You potatoes on the sofa
Lazy motherfuckers, why you ain't even try yet?
Rich or die trying, why you niggas ain't died yet?
Wings tattoo yeah forever on some fly shit
And I’m with the business, get (pyoom!) with a tied clip

What the funk you beezy’s want?
It ain't your turn, better have my money
Friday like Big worm
Can’t see you niggas, you like a little germ
Bitches know I’m excellent like Mr. Burns
See my dick like butter churn
Baby churn and ya girl with me fo’shure
That ain't your concern
She forgot about her man, she will never learn
On a mic 'til I die, RIP Chick Hearn
Yessir, colder than the Pittsburgh winter
Fresher than a Will Smith T-Shirt
Disperse coming through Last King and a hearse
Ask later, shoot first, got shooters like Dirk
When it hurts leave you losers bruised up
Bruce Lee nunchucks
Toe from the floor up though

I can show you my choppa works
She give me head, when my head hurt
Deep throat, till the bitch burp
Her best friend said let me at 'em-Cousin Lurch
Smoking on that turf, get your feelings hurt
At your neck like a collared shirt, ball like a Nerf
Word, more green nigga than smoking pot
When I see more, I'm that horror from that little shop
Shop, butcher shop, open up your top
All you see is gold watch, Rolls Royce, road blocks
Sun roof, fogged out, chrome grill, gold mouth
Take a fuckin' look around

I'm killing this shit, and I'm killing your mom
One verse at a time, the shivers are mine
I murdered this shit, just takin' my time

Been eating so much pussy, man I'm starting to get chubby
Schoolin' motherfuckers, I'm their favorite subject

Always wearin' Louis, but fake Chanel
I'm just tryin' to nut like Chip and Dale
That's some funny-ass shit like Dave Chappelle
Pussy-ass niggas all in my mail
How you get out early? You ain't make that bail
Snitchin' ain't free, but all you do is tell
I heard you breakin' bad, but the shit won't sell
Yeah, all in your momma car wit' no Ls
Now she can't make work, son, you dumb as hell
Need a ghetto bitch wit' long-ass nails
To scratch a nigga back and cook my meals
I got Gs on the block, bitches on the cock
It ain't a house party 'til somebody get shot
Want fifty in the pot, play the scene, they gon' flock
Have a all-white party, niggas hangin' off the yachts
Bang your pistol, you too smart and little
I came wit' my tongue out, I'm high from the free throw
Pussy is mental, it's too good, I sin for

My rim size satellites, that's a deep-ass dish
You niggas' money thinner than a Conehead bitch
No relationships, we ain't developin' shit
Shout-out all my bitcheses, you call them mistresses
I just hit and forget they even existeded
Ha, it's all the same though
I changed the lingo, gave her dangle, buried the dang ho
I'm fuckin' faster, I'm gettin' stronger

Got some time off, Girl it's been so long
Did you have fun?
Cause I'mma need a cab just to get me home
Maybe you could call in sick
Bring it to the crib and get all this, all this
I know I'm blunt, but how real is that?
You want that feeling back?

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready, Chandon got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or give each other space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...

Ain't nobody like you
Heard you got a ballplayer
But he don't excite you
I ain't the one you gotta lie to
Lay down, relax, climax, let me bite you
Still a superfreak
You know how I be when I'm rolling in the streets
Enough about me, I heard you finished your degree
Just call me Ginuwine cause I'm the same Ol' G
We was young, full of insecurities
Grown up now, all we got is old memories
Used to be like enemies, arguing in Barney's, fly shit
Too much pride to say sorry
Shit, problems running like half the day
Number 24, let it fade away
She gotta leave but she wanna stay
She like ""how you feeling babe?""

Fuck around, be a Lennon and a fan, leave you brainless
All in the paper, gettin' buried by a neighbor
While your relatives spendin' all the money that you gave 'em
Fuck it, don't save 'em
Let that boy drown if he don't float, guess he wasn't made for it
My nigga hold it, hold it down
Listenin' to underground
Poppin' uppers 'cause these niggas wanna bring me down
Put your face in the dirt like fourth down

Can't get a fuckin' meal at Pollo Loco without taking photos

Get loaded, can't control it

Can I introduce myself?
I been watching you from far,and it's been too long, can I have this song
I just get so mesmerized when you up and against that pole
I just wanna take you home
Who are they to criticize
How you decide to make your money
I will spend every dime on you baby, take it from me
Since I saw you in the corner
Had to let you know I want ya
All these bitches say you bougie
Didn't stop me from approaching
I don't give a fuck, what your reputation is
I just won't repeat this night and do it all over again
These are the thoughts in my mind
Hope you don't think I'm crazy
Just don't ever try to play me
These are rules aI'm engaging
I sit back in the back and wait for the perfect time
Seems you don't have the time
Wish I could re-reverse the time
Pretty little thang, give me love out of a sippy cup
Sit me up, finish up, zip it up, this is lust

I can make the headboard bang, let me make your clit sing
I'm not tryna be rude
I just wanna see your birthday suit, if it's cool with you
Let me taste, taste your best friend too
Knew you were such a super freak
I could only daydream about it, now it's all reality
I pretend she was you when you make a squirt scene
Am I choking you too hard?
Hope nobody hears you scream
Am a little crazy when it comes to you baby
We can live together, you're my midnight fantasy

I awoke from a dream
Filled of a world full of greed and hate
The world was my thoughts, and surroundings
I realized I needed to rise, and become king
My own destiny

Take a look around, tears from they eyes
Knees on the ground, money in the sky
Take a look around, ain't shit nice?
Praying for my life, hope I make it through the night
Take a look around

[Verse 1]
The city on fire
It's all taking place in the middle of my mind
I stand in the middle, cause death right beside
Murdering is simple, get your life simplified
Where the bones lie, rebuild another life
America's pie, put my hand in the pot
I can't get caught in the streets I was taught
Raised off anger but it wasn't my fault
Nigga, take a look around, it's needles on the ground
Never gave three fucks, and I still don't now
I'm fucking in the house, babysitter on the couch
13 like, ""When this shit coming out?""
Pass me a jimmy, I ain't ready for a child
I hope nobody hears, ""Bitch, why you so loud?""
Turn on the tube, put my head on the cloud
Breathe, inhale, the angels can't help
Tyga, take a look around
Careless world
Take a look around
Careless world

Roll one time for everyone down and
T-two times for the nigga that bounce
Then why you sitting round on some couch shit?
My-my money building like houses, hah!
Feeling like you wise, truth be told, it's all lies
These the days of out lives, why you wasting all of your time?
Voices from the skies said that evil fall in yo rise
They judge me low to the dirt then they celebrate to of my highs
Ha, why you, why you wanna be fake? I fucking hate you
Why you made cause I ain't take you?
Last day alive, I wouldn't date you
I'll replace you with somebody better that you only make up
We just make up, wake up king and queen
And rule the world a little later
Later on in that day, tears all in her face
I said I’m going away, she begging me to stay
Took a look in her eyes, then she put my hands on her waist
Said, “Don’t leave, we’ve got a baby on the way”

Ahh!
Bitch, it's T-Raw, blood on my paws
Big booty chick back a nigga to the wall
Never get involved, murder every bar
Shit so illegal, need a green card
Different cars, different from y'all
I work hard, you work at the mall
Pass a bitch off like my nigga John Wall
Fuck her in the dark, gimme the light, Sean Paul
(Yeahhh), bitch I do this shit
Cooler than a motherfucking penguin limp
& my bitch pussy fire gotta extinguish it, Lebron James & shit
Got heat super freak Rick James ya bitch, leave a stain & shit
On ya couch in ya house like Brother Man
Hanging like Mr. Cooper Hahn

Yo, got a Asian bitch on my left side
Another Asian bitch, right, right side
They might send your ass off to the next side
Bitch hold your damn breath cause you might die
Gotta group of bad bitches and I feel good
Oh your hungry? Too bad cause my meals good
And I shouldn't beat a broad, yet I still would
But I won't try and be bad, cause the deal's good
Yeah, now look I got that urge to feed them off some gold and shit
[Type of stuff] and make them feel like alcohol and [gold] and shit
Hold the bitch, just sold the bitch, 'fuck you pay me' is what I told the bitch
You can't walk or talk, I own you bitch

Well, running from the cop, boy born to kill
Hand me the lock, bring it to your front door, doorbell
Knock knock, who there? Houdini dissappear
Got green, John Deere. More green, Paul Pierce
(agh) Amazing with the shot, you my son, I adopt dot dot
Pac-Man, that's for opening your mouth
Bust a nut, kick her out, lit a cigarrette now
Put the cigarette down, I'm the shit, loose bowels
Wow, Laughing, did I say that out loud?
Nigga getting busy like I work downtown
On to the next if she don't fuck right now (right now)

Two months then the album out
Careless World drop, pewm, then I'm out

Posing, Heisman

[Verse 4: Honey Cocaine]
If a bitch fuck around, I'mma go off
My advice is she better get on the go
You came to shop at the mall but I bought the stores
I got a box of jewels, I call it pot of gold
Got the cop to go, as my pockets grow
Check the chains and the rings and the watches bro
And I boxed a slut, I just boxed a ho
You tryna pass me bitch? It ain't possible, nah
I'm cool as fuck, I suggest you dress for the weather bitch
It's whatever shit, whenever bitch
What a whore to a queen? Whatever bitch
I crop a kid, it's a hot to shit

Waiving the .44, put one, one in your blowhole

You need to take some notes
Niggas steal my lines and say they don't
There go another new quote
I'm fresh off the boat, nigga, let's toast
Young Money real, y'all shit just a hoax
Made a fairy tale, busy on a float
Why would I lie? Forever under oath

Get a flight, I send her home, man, my love is oh so tainted
If you fine, you might get diamonds
If you a five, you might get nothing

Walk a thousand miles
Just to see her (see her)

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Sittin’ on a plane
Reminscing back when I made that mistake
I wish it never ended with a heartbreak
Now your heart broken, tears in ya face
Ask myself why, looking at the sky
If I could turn back I’d make it all right
Praying that you better but its still stormy weather
Don’t wanna let go but the rain won't let up
Now you gone, still thinking bout you everyday
And I know feelings was hurt and you can blame me but
I’m sorry for the games that I played
But now it’s too late
And now she’s…

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again
[Verse 2: Tyga]
It’s cold putting up a fight
Arguing back and forth through the night
Regardless what I said I don’t mean most of it
You know I really love you, this the realest goin’ get
It take time to realize what you really wanna know
You was ready for it all but your feelings I ignored
I know my fault, I should’ve gave more
Now you’re miles away and I’m miles on tour
Now it’s drums playing, crowd singing
Life changing, wish you was here to witness all
Now that starts fading
They say two wrongs don’t make it right
And I was wrong and now it ain't right

[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga + Chris Richardson]
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
If I could make it right
I’d do it all tonight
Hold you in my arms, with you I’d spend my life
Na na na nah
If I could turn back
If I could make it right
I’d do just that
I’d do just that
If I could turn back
(Come back here again)
[Hook: Chris Richardson]
But she’s far, far away
And I’d do anything just to see her face
But she’s far, far away
Walk a thousand miles just to see her smile again

[Bridge: Tyga (Chris Richardson)]
Na na na nah
(Far, far away)
If I could turn back
If I could make it right

My Isis goddess, a peach garden
Sipping Merlot, beach bums, bumping Bob Marley
Reggae party, shirt Cavalli, dress highly
Highly infatuated, spending what you call life savings
Hi ladies, nice day, ain’t it?
South France be my new lady, canvas face paintings
If God were me, you’d be more jealous, the horny
I’d backtrack, hop on the right track with a new somebody
Now let’s back track two years, where I met you at
Night life, popping bottles, acting like you wasn’t impressed with that
That shit, I do for you, I never lack
Need that, got that, never did I second guess
Took you out that C-class, put you in that SLS
No more Southwest, now it’s like private jets
Now all you got is ex-roommates
Cause all you got now is too much room space, shoe space

[Chorus]
Same page but a different day
Everything sweet, peace till a nigga be down and out
Same shit you said yesterday
Can’t take no more of your shit cause I can do better without you
I can do better without you

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Symbolic tattoos cover the scar
Heart tell 'em love move
Cause of you I’ll probably never accept what’s due
Except what’s due, exempt from them nights I could’ve been single too
Moonlight dinner, dark denim
How we losing, we was up in the ninth inning
The night’s ending, attitude on a fire chariot
Ain’t too hilarious, find it embarrassing, you crazy bitch
All I wanted was pom poms, hug and a kiss
Thought you rooting for this team, saw you on some other shit
Acting out publicly, fans recording the shit
Why you can’t play your part and act accordingly?
I guess that’s all me, rubbing off on me
Rubbing off on you, now you got an ego, too
Tell her spread far like an eagle do
I don’t want nothing to do with you, I’m through with you
[Chorus]
Same page but a different day
Everything sweet, peace till a nigga be down and out
Same shit you said yesterday
Can’t take no more of your shit cause I can do better without you
I can do better without you

[Bridge]
You never thought i’d do it, you never thought i’d leave you
You told me you loved me, but I never believed you
Your heart was false just like the words you said
Your stupid ass, corny lines trying to fill my head
Shit, caught up in your perfect world, you never heard me cry
That’s why you never expect to see me say goodbye
You know I’m better off without you
I can manage on my own, you can still have your perfect life
You could have it all alone, cause I’m better without you

[Chorus]
Same page but a different day
Everything sweet, peace till a nigga be down and out
Same shit you said yesterday
Can’t take no more of your shit cause I can do better without you

[Intro]
Yeah, the voice gone

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Driving, but my mind in the back
You ride along, but it's quiet cause we argue prior to that
I left my phone, stopped for gas, then some girl named Janet call
Said it really pissed you off and you let it build a wall
Emotions tall, we’re in the mall and some random girl call didn’t mean to text her back
I ain't trying to lose it all, cause family first and pussy last
The last pussy that I had it was good, but she ain't no trophy to brag
But I should do it anyway, cause we can fall off any day
And you'll be right back to where you was, yeah, your momma place
And things are safe, bills are paid and you just lay around, man, you're so spoiled now, only child!
Business as usual, while you yell our business so loud
Bringing these groupie bitches around you; they ain't your friends, they're foul
Swear so they tell addresses in your mail first to say: ""I told you so!""
But first off, ain't they all alone?
Yeah, I told you so, you keep your enemies too close
Not everybody auntie know, we're supposed to be like on the low!
Remember before we've been down this road, tie your flat on the slope
Came to a stop as soon as I spoke, cause you know:

[Hook: Tyga & Kris Stephens]
I wanna tell the world about you, but it's like we're sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!
I put my faith in God, you put your faith in me, now I'm just trying to keep my sanity!
Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?
Man, I hope we don't be enemies
I'm still seeking..
[Verse 2: Tyga]
I ran into my ex like the other day didn't wanna let you know, cause usually you look the other way
Despise face with hatred, visions of me and her naked
Lies, you can't take it, cheated before, but not much lately!
Lately I've been so into this shit, love is amazing!
Said: 'you was amazing spending your time
All of your time into the days when, but it's one person you relate with
You go wild and lay with!
Never been good with relationships, life difficult, she make it basic
Yeah, when the bass hit I drive slow, your body in my control
It's my control, ain't gotta go no where, just post like field goal!
As the time goes, we'll grow, too..
No telling what I might do without you, cause I got a past and you do too
But I ain't gotta judge what you've been through, cause:

[Hook: Tyga & Kris Stephens]
I wanna tell the world about you, but it's like we're sworn to secrecy!
Why do we sacrifice, growing up to fall in love so fast, hope we don't become enemies!

Why do we sacrifice to fall in love so fast?

Grip on that handle Yosemite Sam ya, that bitch bang like a banjo
Told my arms dealer no need for a box, I don't read the instructions, I throw out the manual (WOO!)

I don't look the same, my camera the same, I made too much money (WOO!)

Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don’t sit with denim
My marble floors are killing, gold cars are so relentless
Five girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists
Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians
God cover my soul, need it, can’t let it go
I know you get lonely when I ain’t home, on the road
I know I ain’t perfect, I’m out here working for the throne
I would take you along but then that college loan you’ll owe
Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us
Saying they all different but I don’t show them no effort
Underestimated that R8 then I tested
Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it
I’m blessed-ed, cross-sign baptism, West shit
Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong
Go against a bull nigga head on
I'm too strong, eight arms, ticking to a bomb
Army stance, ready for war
We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor
Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored
They say my music knocks so I hope it open every door

And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath
Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best
Though I do this to be heard, I'ma do it to death
We ain't cool with all of these niggas, I'm through with all of these niggas
You fool with all of these niggas, you lose like all of these (niggas)
Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits
Anybody riding with young'un will probably recoup
Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics
Finna be king but I’m way too proud to offer as minion
I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga
And don’t offer least of shit to these people’s opinions
I’m a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the bitches

We all kings, give anything to my soft queens
I’m lost without them, when they around, I am Charles Sheen

Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can't, I love this shit

A white Maserati's my birthright car, pass it, I need another hit
At night, where they murdered Herbie Drawz
That's the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball
See I'm born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home
College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom
Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gang bang
Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing
So that make you a queen, surviving anything

I still won't let it show, I won't let it show

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, nigga, welcome to my life
Life feels like I'm running through a red light
Don't believe what the blogs write
Motherfuckers wanna know me so they call me Mike
I'm just chilling, watching the fight
Few friends, fake girls, pour me some ice
Table glass, slippers on, lower the blinds
Never been shy, I just ignore lies
Take a look into Tyga's eyes
I breathe love but inhale the hate bomb
So numb my face gone
I need my space and I don't do Facebook
Uh, serious, look how my face look
How could a man cry while the crowd looks?
Could you walk with me if I give you my foot?
Didn't think you could

[Chorus: Tyga]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show, I won't let it show
[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, I don't wanna feel like most rappers feel when they get a deal
Like, ""Yeah, I'm bigger than him, he's still local""
Gotta keep it real cause they will go loco
Like, ""He ain't ever go through shit we go through""
So I guess now I owe you
No, now I hold you, watch them niggas close to you
But don't compare careers, his and his fools
Acting like I knew you back in middle school
Dropped out, mama said I was a fool
I brought the drop out now me and mama cool
Told her I won't lose, showed her a Jimmy Choo
She call me son now, tell me she real proud
Smiles, uh-huh
Oh what a feeling to be loved
Oh what a feeling to be loved
I wish I could fly like a dove

[Chorus: Tyga]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show
People I love the most, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show, I won't let it show
[Interlude: Tyga]
I've learned that people will forget what you say (I won't let it show)
People will forget what you did or done (I won't let it show)
But people will never forget how you made them feel (baby)
Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened (I won't let it show)

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Cole World, niggas praying for that heat
As the globe twirl, gotta stay up on your feet
'Fore I say it to my girl, I say it to the beat
Then I play it for the world and they say that shit is, deep
Hm, my life changing as we speak
They acting like they never seen a nigga on the beach
I say ""Peace,"" hope it ain't no sharks in my water
Then holla at my mama, man she love to see Obama
Do his, thing, now look how far niggas done came
They had us on the chains now we copping bigger chains
I ain't saying that it's smart, old nigga don't trip
But they had with the whips now we copping bigger whips
Oh shit, wonder how bad will it get 'fore he rise
I'm out here trying to get rich, I survived
And a nigga got God to thank
And I'm still throwing five in the tank, nigga
Cole!

[Chorus: Tyga]
When my emotion grows, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
Even if I'm broke, I still won't let it show
I still won't let it show
My mind overload, I still won’t let it show
I still won’t let it show

Swear when you make it niggas say you owe them
Swear they think they your momma
Everybody with their hands out
They always ask me, they know that I got it
My biggest fear is going broke
Can't say no, that's my problem
I wanted that Rolls-Royce
Young boy looking to make a bad choice
Then it got fucked up when mom went to jail

Dropped out of school but a nigga did fine
I ain't telling you to drop out, but if you do make use of your time

[Intro]
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Yea
I got some shit on my mind

[Verse 1]
First off, this song, meant to be tooken wrong
Bad intentions and all, don't want the problem resolved
Heard it was you I'm like nah not my dawg
Went to school together Took the bus and all
Back of flashin cars, tryna be a boss
Tryna fit in with the hustlers, they told us run along
Tryna learn to shoot dice, got my bike stolen dawg
You still wanna gang bang, ride deep in cars
Til I see the nigga wrong hat, now it’s head off
Picked up a notepad, bet you gon do the same
Wrote down the shit I saw now, I don’t look at shit the same
Now how am I to blame for you choosin a life in made?
Nigga you a man too, why you mad at me?
Same gravity hold you down, that’s embarrassing
Your comments was hilarious, not even congratulations
Told niggas we’re related, even when I made it
Had nothing but good things to say about you even though you still hate it
I know you think ‘cause this fame I’m probably jaded
Ain’t get a chance to see yo daughter, tell her happy belated
For me, I don’t care if that car lease, you in it you own it
And that’s all me, being smart don’t mean cheap
You could take a life sitting in the driver’s seat
Take your shades off, I’m like
(Remember me?)
[Chorus]
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain’t gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

[Verse 2]
Lookin at my story, breakin down my glory
Judging my highlights when it’s shots like Horry
Always tryin to take from me, criticize, hate on me
Wanna call me fake cuz you really can’t relate to me
Your remarks, blatantly out of character
You sociopaths couldn’t make a dollar in America
On your keyboard cuz I blew up like a keloid
Me boy, why you niggas gotta be a kill joy?
I gave you niggas something to ride to
Gave you niggas something to get fly to
Gave you niggas something to die to
Niggas want the fast life, barely in the drive through
I advise you, do what yo life allow you to
You’re a fan nigga? It’s cool, I was once too
All that feedback, really don’t need that
You like it? Buy it
You don’t? don’t cop it
Catid, it be great but my eyes lit
Ignorance is bliss so I can’t blame yo ignorance
It’s irrelevant, I’m relevant
I’m a big event so go ahead and vent
(I’m a big event so go ahead and vent)
[Chorus]
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain’t gotta take it this far
So go on, make a diss song, this is not a diss song
They just wanted this song, tell em play this song
I ain’t tryna diss you
I just wanna know the issue
Listen to this song

[Bridge]
Listen to diss song
Listen to diss song
Diss song
If you know what you say then say who you are
We ain’t gotta take it this far
I ain’t tryna diss you
I ain’t tryna diss you
Tell em play this song
I ain’t tryna diss you
Make a diss song
Tell em play this song
Diss song
Diss song
[Verse3]
Bill rings, let the birds sing
Had to sacrifice, never knew what pain will bring
This moment of clarity
I do it for my auntie’s nephew, never had a niece
They call it spoken word, don’t want it to speak
Don’t mix the colors with whites as if it was bleach
Back of the bus, niggas fightin over window seats
Tryna compete, T-Raww’s
Make this idea complete
Ryan just got killed, who is there to blame?
God rest his soul, tryna protect his gold chain
It’s rules to the shit, but just it ain’t a game
Give or take, niggas still gon violate
Not up for discussion, nobody cockin and bussin
You tough? It’s always someone tougher sayin fuck me some public law
Bussin, I kept it 1000 to be exact
Went from hood racks to Maybachs, how hood is that?
Plaques on the wall, wall match the chrome gat
Gat packed, backpack, backpack rapper never was that
Niggas fire arms like they fuckin fist gone
These simple heartbeats, that’s a real diss song

Really leave your mind gone if you don't mind me asking
Can you put your hands on your hips? Baby dip, dip, dip
Put your shoes on the bed, she my whip, I'ma trip
Windows got tint so you can wear whatever you like
And less is more, the funny thing about life
Is that the clock keep tickin', so let's have a good time
And time is of the essence, you should get undressed and that's fine
And do whatever you could think to take the stress off your mind

(Yeah.. Mally Mall in this bitch, hah)
Bitch better have my money, money
Bring back a 100 take 20, 20
20 more minutes then I'm comin'
I could fuck you longer, but bitch I'm in a hurry
Hurry up, Usain Bolt to the money
Swear I'm the shit, everybody fly around me
Rap like hustle and you hustlin' with dummies
I got a big ego, bitch don't touch me
Fuck her for some money, fuckin' up the country
Pistol with the homies, you at home lonely
Call it my Macaulay, pokin' white boobies
Fuck the, fuck the police, these niggas know they know me
50 for the Rollie, niggas ain't brodies
Hoes got 'em trippin', cuffin' like cufflinks
Don't know where her tongue be - rinse it in the fuckin' sink
I don't care what the bitch think, I just know one thing

Pop a pill, pop a nigga, pop my collar
I'm poppin' like a Tic Tac - bitch you better get back
Funny looking bitch, who been fucking? Sinbad?
I did that; do it all, go big never small
Got a crib with a closet, you would think you at the mall
And her mouth like halls in her jaws like wisdom teeth
You hear the beat; I bet you they gone bang this in the Middle East
I been a freak - 9th grade I was fuckin' in the bathroom

My best friend is named Benjamin Frank
So bitch better have my cake, fo' hunnid

Bitch better have my mula
Fuckin' round with a real nigga and his shooter
Little dust bag bitch! Make a nigga rich
Shut the fuck up and jump on this dick
Nothin' but a motherfuckin' skank
Fuck what you talkin' bout and fuck what you think
I need money, I need it real fast
I need it real bad like white girls need ass
Baby you can help me, break this dub
20 motherfuckin' racks up up in the club (club, club, club)
Club, up-up in the front

Ridin’ on the next clique soon as they up in town
Cause I’m the nigga, the nigga nigga
They hold me down if it’s drama
And if it’s drama, I got that loud
Told my girl, Jeffrey Dahmer, and eat her out
Then I follow, and then I follow, dick in her mouth

Fire flow, let me fascinate
Put python seats, Jake the snake
I rock Bape, that bathin' grape
You fake the Bape, that's pump fake
I ball on turf, that's Chevy Chase
That's Caddyshack, don't be actin' shady
Lash out on the owner, nigga
Don't be harassin' my shorty, nigga
Borin' niggas, don't be borin', niggas
I'm the swag god in the holy temples
Spend 65k on my dental
Got the ripped denim, black card in 'em
3 car garage, black cars in 'em
Need more space to put the Rolls in it
Rollin' blunts for the fuck of it
I'm already high, I'm just talkin' shit
Shit on niggas like an eagle do
Give that bitch a break like an interlude
Bought a parachute, eatin' barracuda
I'm a barbarian rude nigga
With a ghetto gang and some pretty bitches
Walk on Jimmy Kimmel with some real killers
Real niggas, Tommy Hilfiger
This tommy gun my real hitta

Ask me where I used to sleep
In the car parked on the street
Ask me what I used to eat

Now I get served in my master suite
Just watched my bitch masturbate
Shit's milk, and it's sweet, nigga

[Verse 2]
Niggas sweet, I'm the candyman
Here I go again, can't get rid of me
I'm on Sunset, now I'm overseas
Lost the Lambo key, I just ordered 3
Mickey Ds, played the 62
Red and yellow like Ronald do
I'm hard to break like a Rondo 2
Don't weigh a lot but I'll take your food
Face to face, she give me face
'Til her face's blue like hunnits, new
Spend 10K at Mr. Chows
My mama proud, these niggas bow
That's Tyga's style, you stole my style
You a hidden dragon, crouchin' tiger style
Jungle shit, my niggas wild
You a bitch, thinkin' out loud
I'm gamblin', my diamonds loud
My Rollie face original
Look on your face like, nigga how
I came from nothin', had dreams of stuntin'
Never owned a Porsche, so yeah I want it
Just to say I had it, now you can have it
Fuck y'all, I'm just livin' lavish
Rather die that nigga than to live average

Last king

[Chorus: Jess Jackson]
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uhh, Heavenly Father, appoint me to the coronation
I deserve it, brought music for clarification
Envision my past, Egypt reincarnated
Negativity hill, over the hump, camels waiting
Never gave up, most of my peers forsaken
One make it, we all make it but I was never that patient
King chronicles, never write it too logical
Fake niggas saying, ""What up, fam?"" but we ain’t biological
Hands down to my mother, she the greatest ever
Since I was the only child, wasn’t too much to stress her
Waking up before work, leaving allowance on the dresser
Raising the prince under pressure, no king, no refuge
It’s all good, got homies like ""Boyz n the Hood""
We all good, I mean no matter what circumstances was
Champagne, weed, pills, it do the same
These niggas gassed up, too much butane
Working hard like one day, I’ll afford the four-door Porsche
Approaching every corner cautious
Too much shopping, niggas calling you a target
Too much flossing, niggas gossiping that blog shit
I rather put one in the air, congratulate careers
Death defying moments, people that I ain’t seen in years
What you running from when you you’re your only fear?
Guess my time is here now all I see is
[Chorus: Jess Jackson]
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uhh, fatigue, I’m feeling jaded
She gave me the number but I ain’t never saved it
Shit is solid, why these niggas played it?
Dealt the right cards, but I have yet to play it
Determined payrolls, living the lifestyle
You couldn’t be in if you was to see it right now
I think I see it right now
They judge me every day, life on trial
Take your money, niggas betting on my downfall
Many all real hoes, bitches gon' call
Five fingers, pledge allegiance to my one God
We’d have been through hell, so heaven ain’t far
Two cars sedans, tearing it on the way to the Grammys
Guess we nominated, guess they appreciate us
These niggas often imitate us
We just stay creative now all I see is
[Chorus: Jess Jackson & Tyga]
All I see is black crowns
King me cause this is my time now
So all you other niggas bow down
Cause all I see on me is black crowns, black crowns
All I see is black crowns
(One time in the, one time, it's my) Time now
(Two, times in the, two times in the air for the) Bow down
Both hands in the air if you feel me, yeah
Black crowns, black crowns

One time in the, one time in the air for the
Two, two, two times in the, two times in the air for the
Both hands, both hands, both hands in the air for the
One time, two times, times

[Outro: Tyga’s Mother]
Just wanted to call to let you know how proud I am of you sweetie
Uh, this album is amazing
I have never imagined that God would bless you so much
As he is going to continue to bless you
He’s already made you the king that you are
Only one to wear the black crown
Well, I just wanted you to know how much I love you
And how awesome you are
And how I am so, so honored to have a son as yourself
I could never have asked for more, you’re just amazing
And I am just so excited for this album
I think this album is definitely your baby
And it’s definitely gonna be heard by a lot of people
And a lot of people are gonna love it
They’re gonna love it, love it, love it
And God’s gonna continue to bless you with all the talents that you
Ah, I’m just so proud, I just wanna shed a tear right now

Let the gat squeeze, like fresh lemons
Old money but I need more like Demi
Raw like Eddie, keep a sidekick Semmi

Pull up, niggas clear the vicinity
Killing your vanity
Hot like Alana be, shots, niggas scramblin’

Bad bitch, let her in
Late night, Letterman
Allergic to broke niggas, Claritin
7-6 ball hard always stay travellin’
Referee shots got haters back peddlin’
Bald like I’m 70, stay with the weather ‘93
Gotta fly private cause my niggas got felonies
Used to do Beverly, now we shop overseas
Pop that dick, bitches fit it in their ovaries
Damn, I love it when a bitch got her ass tatted
Said she just got it done, don’t pat it
Both hands left cheeks now I’m left handed
Ass so big, can’t look at it
Can’t look at it, can’t look at it
Made me bust fast like I’m trigger happy
She like when I talk shit like Bill O’Reilly
And I give her hard wood, like a cabin
Cabin in the woods
All you niggas actin’ scary
Get my collab on, Dr. Romanelli
Shirt off, nigga feelin’ like Makaveli
Y’all my niggas goin’ HAM
We don’t need a deli
Ain’t shit you can tell me
Got ‘em pissed off, R. Kelly
Bitches tell me “sure” like Al B
All I do is win like Gwen don’t doubt me
Bitch took 22 years to get rich
Been in love twice, still screamin’
“Bitches ain’t shit”
Tryin’ ta keep my niggas out of jail
They always hittin’ licks
And I’m paid in full
Niggas call me Money Makin’ Mitch

Ain't no worser feeling than knowing I did it for the laughs
Arguing all I was doing, accusing you -- my bad
Said let's take some time, never mind, just playing with your mind

Why get caught up in a web of trust?
Only love for fun, I'm too young, I thought
All I wanted was a thanks, them Louboutins I bought

Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, he was dead (he was dead)
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect, nigga

[Verse 3]
Six weeks, had to vacay
Ain't a resident in sight, just a beach, making sex tapes
Sure, say the shit to my face
She gon' get me off, nigga, like bug spray
Bitches all fake and fanatics, causing ruckus with a ratchet
Don't you put that on your loved ones, you are not my level pattern
This is Pacquiao and pack it, peddle faster like a Flintstone
On a roll, full of ashes, we just run you, this the legion
Zulu, it's all gone, Zulu, forever perished
Ten bedrooms in the palace
But your Playboy bunny's ears full of carrots, I told y'all

[Hook 3]
Shaka Zulu noodle with a TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, you was dead
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect, nigga
Temple to the brain from the TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead
And I heard it from a birdie, you was dead
How'd they bring you back to life? That's a star resurrect, nigga
Temple to the brain from the TEC
I go temple to the brain from the TEC
Don't you tell anybody that the babysitter's dead, nigga
[Verse 4/Bridge]
Glory be, lord to be
Fashion so fucking unorderly
Move accordingly, don't order me
You poorer than me, more can afford the fee
Word to Meek, 100 in the dungarees
Who claim the game, we're young living like Meek
Click on the tee, Lord of Rings, you order me
Theatric fairytale's become extinct
Fuck the peace, I put a piece on my neck
'Bout the size of a Complex magazine
I'm not for sale, I bought your dreams
Leonardo DaVinci, the Bentley boost my self-esteem
Bitches cling like the chain already been doing the same thing
I mean this gold for press, G
I'm tryna bob and weave, why you chasing me?
I'm on my victory lap, can't you see?

I smile, I cry
In love I fall
I’ve won, I’ve lost
And I’ll do it all again
This is who I am
Who I am
All I got
It’s all I need

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ugh
Started out wit zero
Just a fist full of tears
Just a pad and a pencil
As I scribbled down my fears
Screaming out I'm ready to die
That's a lie. I ain't going nowhere
Till all my niggas get a Benz
I'm sitting in the crib with the miraculous view
I FaceTime my little man, you know daddy miss you
But I gotta rock this tour and get this mortgage
Smile for us mama, damn you so supportive
So make sure I'm cleared, no distortion
I know we used to argue but you'll always be important
Don't cry for me
Looking out the window, flying over Miami
All bottles prolly poppin' but I'm turned in my album
Get amnesia when they ask
""Who you got your style from ?""
You niggas make me laugh till I cry
Scared to use your voice, all you have is your sight
A blogger’s gon’ blog, a baller’s gon' ball
Charge it to the game and get it in the lane and take the charge
72 and 10
I guess you can't win 'em all
Till my niggas hold on like you waiting on the car
And if you fall its my fault. Shit you know I got you
[Hook: (Tyga)]
I smile, I cry
(You know I got you)
In love I fall

(I do it like I got to)
This is who I am
(Ugh you know I got you)
(Yeah you know I got you)
Who I am
(You know I got you)
All I got is all I need
(I do it like I got to)

[Verse 2]
Ugh, pressure make diamonds
I put pressure all the times
So, I'm always at the jeweler getting fresher all the time
Time for a white suede happy to see me shine
Got me crying on your shoulder, Rawest Nigga Alive
Superb, stand up guy, tallest nigga alive
GQ Party Chateau Marmont
Saint Laurent suit, I had to show my mind
Pull up in the phantom, cameras know my car
Now you looking like me, bitch stole my look
Never played by the book
You see the shows I've booked
Money over bitches, see the hoes I shook
It was long cold nights on the road I took
All the shit I kicked, I should soak my foot
Don't cry for me, hear my flow you know I'm good
Ugh yeah you know I'm good
Cause a blogger's gon' blog, a baller's gon' ball
Check the names in the hall, see my name on the wall
You see everything I do
Matches everything I talk
I swear the summer's mine
And I never let you fall
And if you fall, it's my fault
You know I got you
[Hook: (Tyga)]
I smile, I cry
(You know I got you)
In love I fall
(You know I got you)

Too bad he wanna be with Gucci gang, I won't let him sign up

Rough riders, gang niggas, kush buyers
Get smashed, Halloween, Mike Myers

They call me the royal penis, their highness
For when they give it up, pour it up, leave it wit' us

If you don’t then let me go

[Tyga - verse 1]
The memories soon fade, why couldn’t they be erased
You hoping it’s just a phase, your heart’ll heal within days
Some people think it’s wrong, being single isn’t right
But you hurt the right person you’ll be wrong all your life
Inevitable to let you go, separate the sexual
Feelings when I’m close to you, fuckin' til’ the sky is blue
Morning time, home fries, cookin' with your t-shirt on
Panties, bra, damn I eat you good when you take it off
Ha, damn I’m nasty, I mean you make me nasty
Going the extra mile flyin' just to make me happy
Did it all, too much wasn’t enough
Now it’s gone but sometimes I sit and hope

[Adele]
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it

I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
[Tyga - verse 2]
Whatever ever happened to love and being happy
Infatuated with lust; I loved you and now I’m backwards
Time is of the essence, I broke it, took it for granted
Love is like art, heartbroken on the canvas
Painted the perfect picture, you seemed to never get it
Colors prevail and you turn into a fucking monster
Schizophrenic, nicknames Bonnie and Clyde
Now doctors calling us Mr. and Mrs. Hyde
How do you manage but still do you
Can’t compromise, we all equal opportunists
It’s when I’m level headed they aiming to take my head off
Birds flock together, tell bitches I’m throwing bread off
Cold, women fall in love gettin' splintered
Strictly platonic, only thing she want is dinner
I can’t fuck with her, get her some tonic, gin, liquor
She might let me lick her, now she miss me sayin

[Adele]
I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it

I hoped you’d see my face and that you’d be reminded
I hate to turn out up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
[Tyga]
Angels in the a.m., sin on my flesh
Girls in the p.m., excuses PMS
They all wanna love em, call em Ms. Next
Spirit of a hustler, I only chase checks
Go home
I ain’t tryna do you wrong
I’d rather be alone
Just sittin on the throne6Embed"

The yacht life, hear the splash, so much class
Lift your glass, make a toast, we around the map

I might let the top down if she keep her head this pretty
I love models, I'm a baller, I'm a shooter, I'm a starter
I'mma holler, know I got her, tell her friend just what I bought her
Never post her to the page and if I do, she gotta swallow
Yeah I live in 3-0-5, still calling at the bottle
Drafted straight into the pros, we never did a day of college
