# lyricGPT (pre-alpha)

Using OpenAI's embeddings to search music

## Tutorial

I wrote a tutorial about getting supabase set up and calling OpenAI's API. You can find it [here](tutorial.lyricgpt.io).

## running the app

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

## running generateEmbeddings

Move the `generateEmbeddings` folder to `app/api` and run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Use curl to call endpoint

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3001/api/generateEmbeddings
```
